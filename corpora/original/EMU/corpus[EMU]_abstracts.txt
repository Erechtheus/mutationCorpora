18565893	Risk of cancer by ATM missense mutations in the general population.	PURPOSE: Truncating and missense mutations in the ATM gene, which cause insufficient DNA damage surveillance, allow damaged cells to proceed into mitosis, which eventually results in increased cancer susceptibility. We tested the hypotheses that ATM Ser49Cys and ATM Ser707Pro heterozygosity increase the risk of cancer overall, of breast cancer, and of 26 other cancer subtypes in the  general population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped 10,324 individuals from the Danish general population who were observed prospectively for 36 years, during which 2,056 developed cancer. RESULTS: Multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios for ATM Ser49Cys heterozygotes versus noncarriers were 1.2 (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.5) for cancer overall, 0.8 (95% CI, 0.3 to 2.0) for breast cancer, 4.8 (95% CI, 2.2 to 11) for melanoma, 2.3 (95% CI, 1.1 to 5.0) for prostate cancer, and 3.4 (95% CI, 1.1 to 11) for cancer of the oral cavity/pharynx. Multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios for ATM Ser707Pro heterozygotes versus noncarriers were 0.8 (95% CI, 0.6 to 1.2) for cancer overall, 0.6 (95% CI, 0.2 to 1.6) for breast cancer, 10 (95% CI, 1.1 to 93) for thyroid/other endocrine tumors, and 2.7 (95% CI, 1.0 to 7.6) for cancer of corpus uteri. CONCLUSION: ATM missense mutations do not increase the risk of cancer overall or  of breast cancer in the general population; however, we observed in exploratory analyses that ATM missense mutations may be associated with an increased risk of  other cancer subtypes. As we did multiple comparisons, some of these findings could represent chance findings rather than real phenomena.
18558293	A novel mutation of the PTEN gene in a Japanese patient with Cowden syndrome and  bilateral breast cancer.	Cowden syndrome (CS), also known as multiple hamartoma syndrome, is an autosomal  dominant cancer syndrome associated with a high risk of breast and thyroid cancers. The phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) encodes a lipid phosphatase that contains a PTPase domain and a C2 domain and plays a role as a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the cell-survival signaling pathway initiated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PTEN inhibits angiogenesis, and germline mutations of the PTEN gene are associated with CS. We screened for mutations in the PTEN gene in two unrelated Japanese patients with CS. In one patient, who suffered from bilateral breast cancer, thyroid adenoma, and gastric  malignant lymphoma, we found a single-base substitution in exon 2 (115G>C) of the PTEN gene. This transversion results in a germline missense mutation (A39P). To date, nine different mutations have been identified in exon 2 of the PTEN gene in patients with CS and variant CS; however, the A39P missense mutation has not been reported previously. We also detected a previously reported nonsense mutation, 697C>T, resulting in R233X.
18431743	Consortium analysis of 7 candidate SNPs for ovarian cancer.	The Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium selected 7 candidate single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs), for which there is evidence from previous studies of an association with variation in ovarian cancer or breast cancer risks. The SNPs selected for analysis were F31I (rs2273535) in AURKA, N372H (rs144848) in BRCA2,  rs2854344 in intron 17 of RB1, rs2811712 5' flanking CDKN2A, rs523349 in the 3' UTR of SRD5A2, D302H (rs1045485) in CASP8 and L10P (rs1982073) in TGFB1. Fourteen studies genotyped 4,624 invasive epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 8,113 controls of white non-Hispanic origin. A marginally significant association was found for RB1 when all studies were included [ordinal odds ratio (OR) 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-1.00) p = 0.041 and dominant OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.76-0.98) p = 0.025]; when the studies that originally suggested an association  were excluded, the result was suggestive although no longer statistically significant (ordinal OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79-1.06). This SNP has also been shown to  have an association with decreased risk in breast cancer. There was a suggestion  of an association for AURKA, when one study that caused significant study heterogeneity was excluded [ordinal OR 1.10 (95% CI 1.01-1.20) p = 0.027; dominant OR 1.12 (95% CI 1.01-1.24) p = 0.03]. The other 5 SNPs in BRCA2, CDKN2A, SRD5A2, CASP8 and TGFB1 showed no association with ovarian cancer risk; given the large sample size, these results can also be considered to be informative. These  null results for SNPs identified from relatively large initial studies shows the  importance of replicating associations by a consortium approach.
18375489	Multiplexed assays for detection of mutations in PIK3CA.	BACKGROUND: Mutations in the PIK3CA gene (phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide) have recently been described in a number of cancers, and their detection is currently limited because of the low sensitivity of conventional sequencing techniques. METHODS: We combined Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS; AstraZeneca) allele-specific PCR and Scorpions (DxS) to develop assays for tumor-borne PIK3CA  mutations and used real-time PCR to develop high-throughput multiplexed assays for the most commonly reported PIK3CA mutants (H1047L, H1047R, E542K, E545K). RESULTS: These assays were more sensitive than sequencing and could detect 5 copies of mutant DNA in proportions as low as 0.1% of the total DNA. We assayed DNA extracted from human tumors and detected PIK3CA mutation frequencies of 10.2% in colorectal cancer, 38.7% in breast cancer, 1.9% in lung cancer, and 2.9% in melanoma. In contrast, sequencing detected only 53% of the mutations detected by  our assay. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplexed assays, which can easily be applied to clinical samples, have been developed for the detection of PIK3CA mutations.
18372405	Mutation analysis and characterization of HSD17B2 sequence variants in breast cancer cases from French Canadian families with high risk of breast and ovarian cancer.	Estrogen exposure is a risk factor for breast cancer. Given that HSD17B2 gene encodes an enzyme that catalyses estradiol inactivation, it appears as a good candidate breast cancer susceptibility gene. This study was designed to screen for HSD17B2 germline mutations potentially involved in breast cancer predisposition. Our re-sequencing analysis did not identify any deleterious germline mutations, and therefore mutations in HSD17B2 do not explain the clustering of breast cancer cases in non-BRCA1/2 high-risk French Canadian families. However, six sequence variants were identified, including two novel missense variants. Expression assays revealed that p.Ala111Asp and p.Gly160Arg did not alter the catalytic properties of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 enzyme, although p.Ala111Asp appears to affect protein stability resulting in significant decreases in the protein levels, providing valuable information on structure-function relationship.
18332865	Suppression of PTEN function increases breast cancer chemotherapeutic drug resistance while conferring sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors.	Ectopic expression of mutant forms of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) lacking lipid (G129E) or lipid and protein (C124S) phosphatase activity decreased sensitivity of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which have wild-type PTEN, to doxorubicin and increased sensitivity to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin. Cells transfected with a mutant PTEN gene lacking both lipid and protein phosphatase activities were more resistant to doxorubicin than cells transfected with the PTEN mutant lacking lipid phosphatase activity indicating that the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN was also important in controlling the sensitivity to doxorubicin, while no difference was observed between the lipid (G129E) and lipid and protein (C124S) phosphatase PTEN mutants in terms of sensitivity to rapamycin. A synergistic inhibitory interaction was observed when doxorubicin was combined with rapamycin  in the phosphatase-deficient PTEN-transfected cells. Interference with the lipid  phosphatase activity of PTEN was sufficient to activate Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling. These studies indicate that disruption of the normal activity of the PTEN phosphatase can have dramatic effects on the therapeutic sensitivity of breast cancer cells. Mutations in the key residues which control PTEN lipid and protein phosphatase may act as dominant-negative mutants to suppress endogenous PTEN and alter the sensitivity of breast cancer patients to chemo- and targeted therapies.
18307025	A Japanese patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome who had nine primary malignancies associated with a germline mutation of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene.	We describe a patient who had nine primary malignant tumors and a germline mutation in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene, characteristically found in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). A 15-year-old girl with no family history of cancer was referred to our hospital because of pain and swelling of the right knee. Osteosarcoma was diagnosed. The patient received chemotherapy followed by surgery and had a remission. After the age of 28 years, nine primary malignant tumors developed successively, including right breast cancer, colon cancer, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the abdominal wall, right lung double cancers, bilateral breast cancers, and MFH of the left thigh. This is the second highest number of types of primary malignant tumors to be reported in LFS. All tumors were treated by a multidisciplinary approach, including surgery. Genetic analysis revealed a germline missense mutation in the p53 gene (c.659 A > G), resulting in Y220C, which has been reported in three families with LFS. The patient died of lung metastasis from MFH at the age of 37 years. Despite the multiple tumors, repeated induction of remissions resulted in long survival. Our findings suggest  that a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, including surgery, is beneficial  in patients with LFS.
18288683	Analysis of the gene coding for the BRCA2-interacting protein PALB2 in hereditary prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: The genetic basis of susceptibility to prostate cancer (PRCA) remains elusive. Mutations in BRCA2 have been associated with increased prostate cancer risk and account for around 2% of young onset (<56 years) prostate cancer cases.  PALB2 is a recently identified breast cancer susceptibility gene whose protein is closely associated with BRCA2 and is essential for BRCA2 anchorage to nuclear structures. This functional relationship made PALB2 a candidate PRCA susceptibility gene. METHODS: We sequenced PALB2 in probands from 95 PRCA families, 77 of which had two or more cases of early onset PRCA (age at diagnosis <55 years), and the remaining 18 had one case of early onset PRCA and five or more total cases of PRCA. RESULTS: Two previously unreported variants, K18R and V925L were identified, neither of which is in a known PALB2 functional domain and both of which are unlikely to be pathogenic. No truncating mutations were identified. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that deleterious PALB2 mutations are unlikely to play a significant role in hereditary prostate cancer.
18241035	Breast cancer-associated mutations in metalloprotease disintegrin ADAM12 interfere with the intracellular trafficking and processing of the protein.	ADAM12 has recently emerged as a Candidate Cancer Gene in a comprehensive genetic analysis of human breast cancers. Three somatic mutations in ADAM12 were observed at significant frequencies in breast cancers: D301H, G479E and L792F. The first 2 of these mutations involve highly conserved residues in ADAM12, and our computational sequence analysis confirms that they may be cancer-related. We show that the corresponding mutations in mouse ADAM12 inhibit the proteolytic processing and activation of ADAM12 in NIH3T3, COS-7, CHO-K1 cells and in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The D/H and G/E ADAM12 mutants exert a dominant-negative effect on the processing of the wild-type ADAM12. Immunofluorescence analysis and cell surface biotinylation experiments demonstrate that the D/H and G/E mutants are retained inside the cell and are not transported to the cell surface. Consequently, the D/H and G/E mutants, unlike the wild-type ADAM12, are not capable of shedding Delta-like l, a ligand for Notch receptor, at the cell surface, or of stimulating cell migration. Our results suggest that the breast cancer-associated mutations interfere with the intracellular trafficking of ADAM12 and result in loss of the functional ADAM12 at the cell surface.
18193092	Epidermal growth factor receptor activation in prostate cancer by three novel missense mutations.	While epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dysregulation is known to play a critical role in prostate carcinogenesis, there has been no direct evidence indicating EGFR mutations induce tumorigenesis in prostate cancer. We previously  identified four novel EGFR somatic mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain of prostate cancer patients: G735S, G796S, E804G and R841K. In this study, we investigated the oncogenic potential of these somatic mutations by establishing stable clonal NIH3T3 cells expressing these four mutations and WT EGFR to determine their ability to increase cell proliferation and invasion. In the absence of the EGF ligand, cell proliferation was readily increased in G735S, G796S and E804G mutants compared to WT EGFR. The addition of EGF ligand greatly increased cell growth and transforming ability of these same EGFR mutants. Matrigel invasion assays showed enhanced invasion with G735S, G796S and E804G mutants. Western blot analysis showed that these EGFR mutations enhanced cell growth and invasion via constitutive and hyperactive tyrosine phosphorylation and led to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Akt pathways. Our findings demonstrate the oncogenic activation of three novel EGFR somatic missense mutations in prostate cancer. Molecules that regulate the mechanisms of  their oncogenic activation represent novel targets for limiting tumor cell progression, and further elucidation of these mutations will have utility in prostate cancer treatment.
18186519	Rapid identification of somatic mutations in colorectal and breast cancer tissues using mismatch repair detection (MRD).	Mismatch repair detection (MRD) was used to screen 93 matched tumor-normal sample pairs and 22 cell lines for somatic mutations in 30 cancer relevant genes. Using  a starting amount of only 150 ng of genomic DNA, we screened 102 kb of sequence for somatic mutations in colon and breast cancer. A total of 152 somatic mutations were discovered, encompassing previously reported mutations, such as BRAF V600E and KRAS G12S, G12V, and G13D, as well as novel mutations, including some in genes in which somatic mutations have not previously been reported, such  as MAP2K1 and MAP2K2. The distribution of mutations ranged widely within and across tumor types. The functional significance of many of these mutations is not understood, with patterns of selection only evident in KRAS and BRAF in colon cancer. These results present a novel approach to high-throughput mutation screening using small amounts of starting material and reveal a mutation spectrum across 30 genes in a large cohort of breast and colorectal cancers.
18083510	Characterization of HSD17B1 sequence variants in breast cancer cases from French  Canadian families with high risk of breast and ovarian cancer.	A family history of disease and estrogen exposure are risk factors for breast cancer. The HSD17B1 gene encodes a key steroidogenic enzyme that catalyses the final step of estradiol biosynthesis, rendering it a good candidate gene for breast cancer susceptibility. The current study was designed to screen for HSD17B1 germline mutations potentially involved in breast cancer susceptibility.  DNA samples from 50 individuals affected with breast cancer from non-BRCA1/2 French Canadian families with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer were screened for sequence variants in HSD17B1. Our study identified 28 sequence variants, including three non-synonymous variants, p.Ala238Val, p.Arg259His, p.Ser313Gly, one of which (p.Arg259His) was not previously reported. Functional assays failed to show changes in either activity or recombinant proteins levels for all three variants. Thus, our resequencing analysis does not support the existence of deleterious, gain-of-function or transcription mutations in HSD17B1, which could explain the clustering of breast cancer cases in non-BRCA1/2 high-risk French Canadian families. However, a haplotype-based approach was used  to establish tSNPs, providing a valuable tool for further searches of common disease-associated variants in this gene, using large cohorts.
18036263	Identification of BRCA1 missense substitutions that confer partial functional activity: potential moderate risk variants?	INTRODUCTION: Many of the DNA sequence variants identified in the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 remain unclassified in terms of their potential pathogenicity. Both multifactorial likelihood analysis and functional approaches  have been proposed as a means to elucidate likely clinical significance of such variants, but analysis of the comparative value of these methods for classifying  all sequence variants has been limited. METHODS: We have compared the results from multifactorial likelihood analysis with those from several functional analyses for the four BRCA1 sequence variants  A1708E, G1738R, R1699Q, and A1708V. RESULTS: Our results show that multifactorial likelihood analysis, which incorporates sequence conservation, co-inheritance, segregation, and tumour immunohistochemical analysis, may improve classification of variants. For A1708E, previously shown to be functionally compromised, analysis of oestrogen receptor,  cytokeratin 5/6, and cytokeratin 14 tumour expression data significantly strengthened the prediction of pathogenicity, giving a posterior probability of pathogenicity of 99%. For G1738R, shown to be functionally defective in this study, immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed previous findings of inconsistent  'BRCA1-like' phenotypes for the two tumours studied, and the posterior probability for this variant was 96%. The posterior probabilities of R1699Q and A1708V were 54% and 69%, respectively, only moderately suggestive of increased risk. Interestingly, results from functional analyses suggest that both of these  variants have only partial functional activity. R1699Q was defective in foci formation in response to DNA damage and displayed intermediate transcriptional transactivation activity but showed no evidence for centrosome amplification. In  contrast, A1708V displayed an intermediate transcriptional transactivation activity and a normal foci formation response in response to DNA damage but induced centrosome amplification. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the need for a range of functional studies to be performed in order to identify variants with partially compromised function. The  results also raise the possibility that A1708V and R1699Q may be associated with  a low or moderate risk of cancer. While data pooling strategies may provide more  information for multifactorial analysis to improve the interpretation of the clinical significance of these variants, it is likely that the development of current multifactorial likelihood approaches and the consideration of alternative statistical approaches will be needed to determine whether these individually rare variants do confer a low or moderate risk of breast cancer.
17919354	Remission of porphyria cutanea tarda after anastrozole treatment of breast cancer.	Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is sometimes precipitated or aggravated by increased exposure to estrogen, estrogen-like compounds, or tamoxifen. We report  the case of a 37-year-old white woman who developed sporadic PCT after she took oral contraceptives for 10 years. She was heterozygous for the common H63D mutation of the hemochromatosis-associated HFE gene. The PCT responded partially  to the cessation of oral contraceptives and to phlebotomy therapy to maintain low iron stores, but only remitted after she received anastrozole therapy for management of adenocarcinoma of the breast at age 59 years. The pertinence of HFE mutations, anastrozole and tamoxifen treatment, and chemotherapy to the development and management of PCT in women with breast cancer is discussed.
17889706	Identification of rare variants in the hLIMD1 gene in breast cancer.	The hLIMD1 gene is located at chromosome 3p21 and was identified as a putative tumor suppressor gene using an elimination test assay. Chromosome 3p21 loci are frequently deleted in a number of cancers, including breast. The 3p21.3 locus harbors a number of tumor suppressor candidates, including LIMD1, a member of the ZYXIN family of genes. LIMD1 directly interacts with RB and is thought to play a  role in suppressing tumor growth. To investigate whether mutations in the LIMD1 gene could potentially be involved in breast cancer, we used single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis on DNA from 235 breast cancers and 95 controls. We identified four novel coding region alterations, including two amino acid substitutions at positions 255 and 302. The two remaining novel variants were found at amino acid positions 246 and 647 and encoded silent alterations. The rare Ser255Arg variant was identified in only sporadic breast tumors (2/165 tumors). Some ZYXIN proteins are phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinases, and  the Ser255Arg change is located in a region phosphorylated on serine residues. Together, the data suggest that this variant may warrant further characterization.
17848578	Structural requirements for the BARD1 tumor suppressor in chromosomal stability and homology-directed DNA repair.	The BRCA1 tumor suppressor exists as a heterodimeric complex with BARD1, and this complex is thought to mediate many of the functions ascribed to BRCA1, including  its role in tumor suppression. The two proteins share a common structural organization that features an N-terminal RING domain and two C-terminal BRCT motifs, whereas BARD1 alone also contains three tandem ankyrin repeats. In normal cells, the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer is believed to enhance chromosome stability by promoting homology-directed repair (HDR) of double strand DNA breaks. Here we have investigated the structural requirements for BARD1 in this process by complementation of Bard1-null mouse mammary carcinoma cells. Our results demonstrate that the ankyrin and BRCT motifs of BARD1 are each essential for both chromosome stability and HDR. Tandem BRCT motifs, including those found at the C  terminus of BARD1, are known to form a phosphoprotein recognition module. Nonetheless, the HDR function of BARD1 was not perturbed by synthetic mutations predicted to ablate the phospho-recognition activity of its BRCT sequences, suggesting that some functions of the BRCT domains are not dependent on their ability to bind phosphorylated ligands. Also, cancer-associated missense mutations in the BRCT domains of BARD1 (e.g. C557S, Q564H, V695L, and S761N) have been observed in patients with breast, ovarian, and endometrial tumors. However,  none of these was found to affect the HDR activity of BARD1, suggesting that any  increased cancer risk conferred by these mutations is not because of defects in this repair mechanism.
17574969	Association of the BRCA1 missense variant R1699W with a malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast.	Familial breast carcinomas that are attributable to BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have characteristic morphologic and immunhistochemical features. BRCA1-associated carcinomas are poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal carcinomas frequently exhibiting morphologic features of typical or atypical medullary carcinomas such  as prominent lymphocytic infiltrate and pushing margins. We report on a patient carrying the deleterious BRCA1 germline mutation R1699W, who presented with a malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast. The re-investigation of archival material by a reference pathologist of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GCHBOC) revealed BRCA-associated pronounced pushing margins. In a total of 618 unrelated index patients who are registered in the GCHBOC database, no other phyllodes tumor has been described, while 10 carriers of the R1699W mutant have been identified. We conclude that the histopathologic appearance of the phyllodes tumor indicates an association with the BRCA1 mutation R1699W although it is a rare event in BRCA-positive families.
17553133	Risk factors for breast cancer characterized by the estrogen receptor alpha A908G (K303R) mutation.	INTRODUCTION: Estrogen is important in the development of breast cancer, and its  biological effects are mediated primarily through the two estrogen receptors alpha and beta. A point mutation in the estrogen receptor alpha gene, ESR1, referred to as A908G or K303R, was originally identified in breast hyperplasias and was reported to be hypersensitive to estrogen. We recently detected this mutation at a low frequency of 6% in invasive breast tumors of the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS). METHODS: In this report, we evaluated risk factors for invasive breast cancer classified according to the presence or absence of the ESR1 A908G mutation in the CBCS, a population-based case-control study of breast cancer among younger and older white and African-American women in North Carolina. Of the 653 breast tumors evaluated, 37 were ESR1 A908G mutation-positive and 616 were mutation-negative. RESULTS: ESR1 A908G mutation-positive breast cancer was significantly associated  with a first-degree family history of breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69, 95%  confidence interval [CI] = 1.15 to 6.28), whereas mutation-negative breast cancer was not. Comparison of the two case subgroups supported this finding (OR = 2.65,  95% CI = 1.15 to 6.09). There was also the suggestion that longer duration of oral contraceptive (OC) use (OR = 3.73, 95% CI = 1.16 to 12.03; Ptrend = 0.02 for use of more than 10 years) and recent use of OCs (OR = 3.63, 95% CI = 0.80 to 16.45; Ptrend = 0.10 for use within 10 years) were associated with ESR1 A908G mutation-positive breast cancer; however, ORs for comparison of the two case subgroups were not statistically significant. Hormone replacement therapy use was inversely correlated with mutation-negative breast cancer, but the effect on mutation-positive cancer was unclear due to the small number of postmenopausal cases whose tumors carried the mutation. Mutation-negative breast cancer was associated with several reproductive factors, including younger age at menarche (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.94) and greater total estimated years of ovarian function (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.21 to 2.74). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that OCs may interact with the ESR1 A908G mutant receptor to drive the development of some breast tumors.
17550384	Somatic mutations of BECN1, an autophagy-related gene, in human cancers.	Evasion of programmed cell death (PCD) is one of the hallmarks of human cancers.  It is well known that not only apoptosis, but also autophagy, acts as an action mechanism of PCD. BECN1 protein is a key regulator of autophagic PCD. The BECN1 gene that encodes BECN1 protein acts as a haploinsufficient tumor-suppressor gene. However, to date, data on BECN1 mutation in human cancer tissues are lacking. To explore the possibility that somatic mutation of the BECN1 gene might contribute to the development of human cancers, we analyzed the entire coding region and all splice sites of the human BECN1 gene for detection of somatic mutations in 180 gastric carcinomas, 94 breast carcinomas, 50 acute leukemias, 50 colorectal carcinomas, 50 hepatocellular carcinomas, and 124 non-small cell lung  cancers by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. Overall, we detected 11 somatic mutations of the BECN1 gene, including 3 missense mutations (N8K, P350R and R389C) in coding sequences and 8 mutations in introns.  The mutations were observed in five gastric, three colorectal, one lung and one breast carcinoma (s). We expressed the three mutations (N8K, P350R and R389C) in  HT1080 cells, and found that two (P350R and R389C) of them showed only slightly decreased cell death activities compared to the wild-type BECN1. This is the first report on BECN1 gene mutations in human cancer tissues, and the data suggest that point mutations are a rare event in common human cancers and probably do not play a major role in cancer pathogenesis.
17541742	Germline TP53 mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative French Canadian breast cancer families.	About 40% of French Canadian breast and/or ovarian cancer families harbor germline BRCA1 or BRCA1 mutations where common mutations account for about 84% of all mutations identified in cancer families. Within a series of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative families, a germline TP53 13398 G>A (Arg213Gln) mutation was identified, which was selected for mutation analysis in this gene because of a family history consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Given the founder effects in this population, the 13398 G>A mutation was screened in series of 52 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families, and a mutation-positive family was identified. However, pedigree inspection and expansion of mutation-positive families with the same mutation revealed that they were closely related to each other. To further characterize the contribution of TP53 in cancer families, mutation analysis was performed in the remaining BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families. Thirty sequence variants were identified, the  majority of which occur in intronic sequences and are not predicted to affect the functionality of TP53. However, the 14538 G>A (Arg290His) mutation was identified in a family which did not exhibit features consistent with LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome. Neither of the TP53 mutations was detected in 381 French Canadian women with breast cancer diagnosed before 50 years of age not selected for family history of cancer. In all, germline TP53 mutations were identified in two of 52 (3.8%) cancer families, suggesting that TP53 is not a major contributor to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast and/or ovarian cancer families of French Canadian descent.
17531442	Identification of sequences that target BRCA1 to nuclear foci following alkylative DNA damage.	BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor involved in the maintenance of genome integrity. BRCA1 co-localizes with DNA repair proteins at nuclear foci in response to DNA double-strand breaks caused by ionizing radiation (IR). The response of BRCA1 to  agents that elicit DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) is poorly defined. In this study, we compared chemicals that induce SSB repair and observed the most striking nuclear redistribution of BRCA1 following treatment with the alkylating  agent methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS). In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, MMTS induced movement of endogenous BRCA1 into distinctive nuclear foci that co-stained with the SSB repair protein XRCC1, but not the DSB repair protein gamma-H2AX. XRCC1 did not accumulate in foci after ionizing radiation. Moreover,  we showed by deletion mapping that different sequences target BRCA1 to nuclear foci induced by MMTS or by ionizing radiation. We identified two core MMTS-responsive sequences in BRCA1: the N-terminal BARD1-binding domain (aa1-304) and the C-terminal sequence aa1078-1312. These sequences individually are ineffective, but together they facilitated BRCA1 localization at MMTS-induced foci. Site-directed mutagenesis of two SQ/TQ motif serines (S1143A and S1280A) in the BRCA1 fusion protein reduced, but did not abolish, targeting to MMTS-inducible foci. This is the first report to describe co-localization of BRCA1 with XRCC1 at SSB repair foci. Our results indicate that BRCA1 requires BARD1 for targeting to different types of DNA lesion, and that distinct C-terminal sequences mediate selective recruitment to sites of double- or single-strand DNA damage.
17517479	Possession of ATM sequence variants as predictor for late normal tissue responses in breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: The ATM gene product is a central component of cell cycle regulation and genomic surveillance. We hypothesized that DNA sequence alterations in ATM predict for adverse effects after external beam radiotherapy for early breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 131 patients with a minimum of 2 years follow-up who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy were screened for sequence alterations in ATM using DNA from blood lymphocytes. Genetic variants were identified using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group late morbidity scoring schemes for skin and subcutaneous tissues were applied to quantify the radiation-induced effects. RESULTS: Of the 131 patients, 51 possessed ATM sequence alterations located within exons or in short intron regions flanking each exon that encompass putative splice site regions. Of these 51 patients, 21 (41%) exhibited a minimum  of a Grade 2 late radiation response. In contrast, of the 80 patients without an  ATM sequence variation, only 18 (23%) had radiation-induced adverse responses, for an odds ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.2). Fifteen patients were heterozygous for the G-->A polymorphism at nucleotide 5557, which causes substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at position 1853 of the ATM protein. Of these 15 patients, 8 (53%) exhibited a Grade 2-4 late response compared with 31 (27%) of the 116 patients without this alteration, for an odds ratio of 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-9.4). CONCLUSION: Sequence variants located in the ATM gene, in particular the 5557 G-->A polymorphism, may predict for late adverse radiation responses in breast cancer patients.
17502119	ATM missense variant P1054R predisposes to prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is associated with defective DNA strand break repair  after DNA damage leading to genetic instability and prostate cancer progression.  The ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) gene product is known to play an important role in cell cycle regulation and maintenance of genomic integrity. We  investigated whether the prevalence of the ATM missense substitution P1054R is increased in a hospital-based series of prostate cancer patients and whether carriers are at increased risk for treatment-related side effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 261 patients treated for early-stage prostate cancer with I-125 brachytherapy (permanent seed implantation) between 10/2000 and 04/2006 at our institution and a comparison group of 460 male control individuals were screened for the presence of the P1054R variant. Outcome of therapy regarding morbidity was assessed prospectively and compared between carriers vs. non-carriers with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), a Quality-of-Life-index (QoL) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) with its subgroups (IIEF-5 and EF). RESULTS: The proportion of carriers of the P1054R variant was significantly higher among prostate cancer patients than in the general population (25 out of 261 vs. 22 out of 460; OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.8, p<0.01). A subgroup of the carriers additionally harboured the ATM missense variant F858L that was associated with a similar risk (OR=2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.6; p=0.03). After a mean follow-up of 18 months there were no statistically significant differences regarding IPSS (p=0.48), QoL (p=0.61), IIEF-15 score (p=0.78), IIEF-5 score (p=0.83), and EF score (p=0.80), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ATM missense variant P1054R confers an about twofold increased risk for prostate cancer in our series. The subgroup of patients with the second-site variant F858L is not at significantly higher risk. After 18 months, there was no evidence for an increased adverse radiotherapy response in P1054R carriers.
17493881	Thermal unfolding of human BRCA1 BRCT-domain variants.	Missense mutations at the BRCT domain of human BRCA1 protein have been associated with an elevated risk for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer. They have been shown  to affect the binding site and they have also been proposed to affect domain stability, severely hampering the protein's tumor suppressor function. In order to assess the impact of various such mutations upon the stability and the function of the BRCT domain, heat-induced denaturation has been employed to study the thermal unfolding of variants M1775R and R1699W, which have been linked with  the disease, as well as of V1833M, which has been reported for patients with a family history. Calorimetric and circular dichroism results reveal that in pH 9.0, 5 mM borate buffer, 200 mM NaCl, analogously to wild type BRCT, all three variants undergo partial thermal unfolding to a denatured state, which retains most of the native's structural characteristics. With respect to wild-type BRCT,  the mutation M1775R induces the most severe effects especially upon the thermostability, while R1699W also has a strong impact. On the other hand, the thermal unfolding of variant V1833M is only moderately affected relative to wild-type BRCT. Moreover, isothermal titration calorimetric measurements reveal that contrary to M1775R and R1699W variants, V1833M binds to BACH1 and CtIP phosphopeptides.
17487399	VEGF transcription and mRNA stability are altered by WT1 not DDS(R384W) expression in LNCaP cells.	To identify physiologically relevant WT1 transcriptional target genes in prostate cancer cells, we have established stably transfected LNCaP cell lines expressing  either WT1(A), its mutant counterpart DDS(R384W), or vector control. Microarray analyses of these cells revealed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was differentially expressed in the engineered lines. Regulation of VEGF by WT1 likely contributes to kidney angiogenesis during development and WT1 mutants such as DDS(R384W) are associated with the Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), characterized by renal abnormalities. Recent mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the WT1(A) isoform binds VEGF promoter sequences and transcriptionally regulates VEGF reporter constructs. However, regulation of VEGF is complex, involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. This study examined the ability of hormone and Actinomycin D treatment to alter VEGF mRNA levels in stably transfected WT-LNCaP, DDS-LNCaP, or V-LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The rationale of this study was based on a previous finding that enhancement of VEGF  expression in DDS-LNCaP cells occurred only in the presence of the androgen analog, R1881. One possible explanation for these results was that DDS-WT1 stabilized VEGF mRNA so that it accumulated to higher levels. This hypothesis was tested by treating engineered LNCaP cells with Actinomycin D (Act D) and then measuring VEGF mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR. The combined effects of WT1 or DDS(R384W) and hormone were tested in these message stability assays and also in transcription assays of transiently transfected LNCaP cells. The results  indicated that DDS-WT1 is unable to regulate VEGF transcription or stabilize VEGF mRNA in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. However our observations are also consistent with wild-type WT1(A) having both transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects on VEGF mRNA levels in the presence of hormone. These studies of VEGF regulation by WT1 and dysregulation by DDS(R384W) suggest an important role for WT1 in both normal and tumor-related angiogenesis.
17443496	Mutations and polymorphisms of the p21B transcript in breast cancer.	p21(WAF1/CIP1), transcribed from the CDKN1A locus, plays a key role executing p53-induced growth arrest. The recent discovery that an alternative transcript, p21B, induces apoptosis, suggests an additional important function of this gene.  Here, we report p21 and p21B mutation status in large cohorts of breast cancers and compare distributions of p21B polymorphisms in cancer patients to healthy controls. In 521 breast tumor samples analyzed, only one point mutation affecting the p21B protein was observed. No mutations were found when screening a panel of  20 established cell lines. A novel polymorphism, p21B(G128T) was identified. Haplotype analysis revealed no association between this variant and the previously identified p21B polymorphism p21B(T35C) or any of the known p21(WAF1/CIP1) polymorphisms. As previously reported for p21B(T35C), distribution of p21B(G128T) was similar among breast cancer patients and healthy controls (n = 691 and 1,015; incidence 6.1 vs. 4.8%; p = 0.273, respectively). No association between p21B(G128T) or p21B(T35C) and response to chemotherapy with an anthracycline-containing regimen or paclitaxel was recorded. Our findings do not  suggest mutations or polymorphisms of p21B to play a major role with respect to either breast cancer risk or sensitivity towards chemotherapy.
17427234	Composite adrenal anaplastic neuroblastoma and virilizing adrenocortical tumor with germline TP53 R248W mutation.	Composite tumors are extremely rare. Such tumors in adrenal glands are usually of neuroendocrine-neural type and occur mostly in adults. Their pathogenesis remains elusive. We report a patient with composite neuroblastoma (NB), adrenocortical tumor (ACT), and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) with germline TP53 R248W mutation. LFS predisposes to the development of leukemia, sarcomas, adrenocortical and breast carcinomas, brain tumors and, questionably, NB. A unique correlation between a single TP53 mutation (R337H) and ACT has been reported in southern Brazilian children. It remains unclear at this time whether a similar association of NB and R248W in patients with LFS exists.
17336451	Uncoupling of hormone-dependence from chaperone-dependence in the L701H mutation  of the androgen receptor.	The mechanisms underlying androgen receptor (AR)-mediated progression of prostate cancer following androgen ablation have yet to be fully determined. On this basis we screened naturally occurring mutants of human AR for hormone-independent activity using a yeast model system. An initial screen of 43 different mutants revealed that ARs having a Leu701His mutation (AR(L701H)) exhibited hormone-independent activation of a lacZ reporter gene. The AR(L701H) mutant bound dihydrotestosterone to a similar extent as did wild type AR, although its ability to be induced by hormone for transactivation was reduced substantially. Subsequent studies focused on the dependence of AR(L701H) on molecular chaperones for folding to the active state. We found that AR(L701H) was highly dependent on  Hsp90 for its hormone-independent activation, suggesting that this chaperone functions in AR(L701H) folding. However, the mutant did not respond specifically  to increased levels of FKBP52, suggesting that this chaperone functions at the hormone-dependent activation stage in the folding process. Further studies of AR(L701H) in PC3 cells suggested that this mutant is prohibited from hormone-independent transactivation in mammalian cells. However, basal expression of a reporter gene by AR(L701H) was not impaired by the presence of 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin as was wild type AR, suggesting differential interactions of these receptors with molecular chaperones in animal  cells.
17317153	BRCA1 promoter deletions in young women with breast cancer and a strong family history: a population-based study.	Women diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 40 years who have a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer were selected from an Australian population-based case-control-family study for large deletion screening within the BRCA1 promoter. Deletions within the BRCA1 promoter region are usually not detected by the methods applied in routine clinical mutation detection strategies. Fifty-one of the 66 women (77%) who met our inclusion criteria were tested for promoter deletions using linkage disequilibrium analysis of two BRCA1  polymorphic sites (C/G1802 and Pro871Leu) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification. Two cases of BRCA1 promoter deletion involving exons 1A-2 and exons 1A-23 were detected. The morphology of the breast cancers arising in these  women with BRCA1 promoter deletions was consistent with the morphology associated with other germline BRCA1 mutations. Large genomic deletions that involve the promoter regions of BRCA1 make up 20% (2/10) of all known BRCA1 mutations in this group of young women with a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer. Our data support the inclusion of testing for large genomic alterations in the BRCA1 promoter region in routine clinical mutation detection within BRCA1.
17217814	[Prevalence of Val158Met polymorphism in COMT gene on non-BRCA1/2 hereditary breast cancer].	OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence of Val158Met polymorphism in Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene and its effect on genetic susceptibility for breast cancer in Shanghai population. METHODS: A total of 114 patients with BRCA1/BRCA 2 negative hereditary breast cancer from independent families and 121 age-matched healthy controls were analyzed. Genotype analysis was conducted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and  then DNA direct sequencing. The odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression model. RESULTS: The frequency of Val158Met polymorphism GG, GA and AA genotype in case group and control was 0.58 (65), 0.32 (36), 0.10 (11) and 0.60 (66), 0.35 (41), 0.03 (3), respectively. The frequency of allele-containing genotypes is significantly higher in early-onset breast cancer patients (0.57) than in familial ones (0.35). Compared with GG (Val/Val) genotype, AA (Met/Met) genotype  confers a significantly increased risk for breast cancer (adjusted OR = 3.15; 95% CI, 0.70 - 14.19), especially among premenopausal women (adjusted OR = 9.98; 95%  CI, 1.00 - 99.64). Borderline significantly association was found between AA genotype (adjusted OR = 7.57; 95% CI, 0.57 - 101.28) and susceptibility for breast cancer in BMI < or = 23 kg/m(2) group. CONCLUSIONS: Val158Met polymorphism in COMT gene could be a candidate for low penetrance breast cancer susceptibility in Shanghai population, especially among  premenopausal women and early-onset breast cancer patients.
17130833	Negative regulation of chemokine receptor CXCR4 by tumor suppressor p53 in breast cancer cells: implications of p53 mutation or isoform expression on breast cancer cell invasion.	Chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 are suggested to be involved in migration, invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Mutation of the tumor  suppressor gene p53 in breast cancer is associated with metastasis and aggressive clinical phenotype. In this report, we demonstrate that wild type but not the dominant-negative mutant (V143A) or cancer-specific mutants (R175H or R280K) of p53 repress CXCR4 expression. Recently described cancer-specific p53 isoform, Delta133p53, also failed to repress CXCR4 promoter activity. Short-interfering RNA-mediated depletion of p53 increased endogenous CXCR4 expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that contain wild-type p53. Basal CXCR4 promoter activity in  HCT116 colon carcinoma cells deleted of p53 [HCT116(p53KO)] was 10-fold higher compared to that in parental HCT116 cells with functional wild-type p53. Deletion analysis of CXCR4 promoter identified a seven-base pair p53-repressor element homologous to cyclic AMP/AP-1 response (CRE/AP-1) element. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed binding of ATF-1 and cJun to the CRE/AP-1 element. The p53 rescue drug PRIMA-1 reduced CXCR4 mRNA  and cell surface expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, which express R280K mutant p53.  CP-31398, another p53 rescue drug, similarly reduced cell surface levels of CXCR4. PRIMA-1-mediated decrease in CXCR4 expression correlated with reduced invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells through matrigel. These results suggest a mechanism  for elevated CXCR4 expression and metastasis of breast cancers with p53 mutations or isoform expression. We propose that p53 rescue drugs either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs may be effective in reducing CXCR4-mediated metastasis.
17020975	RNASEL gene polymorphisms and the risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: Studies revealing conflicting results on the role of RNASEL polymorphisms Glu265X, Arg462Gln, and Asp541Glu on prostate cancer risk led us to perform a meta-analysis to investigate the association of these polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Relevant studies were selected by searching PubMed from January 1996 to August 2005 using keywords "RNASEL gene AND prostate cancer." For each study, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated  to estimate the gene effect. Pooled estimates of the OR were computed using the random effects model. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis. The overall results suggested no major influence of these variants on prostate cancer risk. However,  analysis of the Asp541Glu polymorphism by ethnic populations showed that Asp/Glu  (familial cases versus control: OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.04-1.82; sporadic cases versus control: OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-1.48; prostate cancer versus control: OR,  1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.48) and Asp/Glu + Glu/Glu (familial cases versus control: OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.10-1.70; sporadic cases versus control: OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.44; prostate cancer versus control: OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.13-1.44) increased prostate cancer risk in Caucasians, thus suggesting a dominant model for the Glu  variant. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the genotype Asp/Asp, the Glu variant at the Asp541Glu polymorphism increases prostate cancer risk by <2-fold in Caucasians, regardless  of family history of the disease. This suggests that genuine genetic effects of this polymorphism may account for only a part of prostate cancer in the Caucasian population.
17001622	Characterization of the breast cancer associated ATM 7271T>G (V2424G) mutation by gene expression profiling.	Mutations in ATM are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia. Heterozygous mutations in ATM have been associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. We previously reported one breast cancer family in which ATM 7271T>G (V2424G) segregated with disease, and apparently acted in a  dominant negative manner. We now report the screening of 782 multiple-case breast cancer families that identified two additional index cases with ATM 7271T>G. Phylogenetic sequence analysis showed that V2424 is a highly conserved residue, and that the 2424G variant is likely to interfere with function. To elucidate the consequences of this mutation, we expression profiled wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from Scottish and Australian families using an oligonucleotide microarray. Cluster analysis revealed 77 genes  that were differentially expressed in homozygous and heterozygous V2424G cells (compared to wild-type) and 11 genes differentially expressed in the homozygous cells. We also evaluated the profiles of LCLs after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and identified 77 genes that were differentially expressed in wild-type cells, but not in homozygous or heterozygous V2424G cells. We validated the expression differences by RT-PCR in additional heterozygous V2424G LCLs from  another breast cancer family. We found no consistent cytotoxicity or abrogation of ATM kinase activity after IR in seven heterozygous V2424G LCLs, compared to wild-type LCLs, but did find an increase in the number of chromosomal aberrations. These data suggest that the V2424G missense mutation acts largely as a dominant negative in terms of the associated expression profiles.
16969499	Missense mutations of BRCA1 gene affect the binding with p53 both in vitro and in vivo.	Women with BRCA1 gene mutations have an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer (BOC). Classification of missense variants as neutral or disease causing is still a challenge and has major implications for genetic counseling. BRCA1 is  organized in an N-terminal ring-finger domain and two BRCT (breast cancer C-terminus) domains, involved in protein-protein interaction. The integrity of the C-terminal, BRCT repeat region is also critical for BRCA1 tumor suppressor function. Several molecular partners of BRCA1 have so far been identified; among  them, the tumor suppressor protein p53 seems to play a major role. This study was aimed at evaluating the impact of two missense mutations, namely the W1837R and the S1841N, previously identified in BOC patients and located in the BRCT domain  of the BRCA1 gene, on the binding capacity of this protein to p53. Co-immunoprecipitation assays of E. coli-expressed wild-type and mutated BRCTs challenged with a HeLa cell extract revealed, for the S1841N variant a significant reduction in the binding activity to p53, while the W1837R mutant showed an inverse effect. Furthermore, a clonogenic soft agar growth assay performed on HeLa cells stably transfected with either wild-type or mutant BRCA1  showed a marked decrease of the growth in wild-type BRCA1-overexpressing cells and in BRCA1S1841N-transfected cells, while no significant changes were detected  in the BRCA1W1837R-transfected cells. These results demonstrate that: i) distinct single nucleotide changes in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 affect binding of this protein to the tumor suppressor p53, and ii) the two missense mutations here described are likely to play a role in breast tumorigenesis. We suggest that in vitro/in vivo experiments testing the effects of unclassified BRCA1 gene variants should therefore be taken in to consideration and that increased surveillance should be adopted in individuals bearing these two BRCA1 missense alterations.
16963262	Identification of germline MLH1 alterations in familial prostate cancer.	Several linkage and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses suggest that the region 3p21-p26, which is a chromosomal location of MLH1, could harbour a susceptibility gene for prostate cancer (PRCA). Furthermore, in a recent candidate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis the I219V variation of the MLH1 gene was associated with PRCA. Microsatellite instability (MSI) and germ-line MLH1 mutations were originally demonstrated in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) but MSI and loss of MLH1 function have also been detected in PRCA. To assess the contribution of MLH1 germline mutations to the development of PRCA  in Finland different approaches were used. First, the samples from 11 PRCA-colon  cancer patients were screened for MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC revealed one patient with a putative MLH1 aberration and sequencing of this sample revealed five sequence variants including two missense variants P434L and I219V. Second, the samples from Finnish hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) families were used for the screening of MLH1 mutations which produced twelve MLH1 sequence variants including two missense mutations, I219V, as in the PRCA-colon cancer patient, and V647M. P434L and V647  were both novel, rare variants. Carrier frequencies of the I219V mutation were compared between hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) patients, unselected PRCA cases, patients with benign prostate hyperplasia and controls, but no differences between the sample groups were found. P434L was not present in this study population and V647M was a very rare variant found only in one HPC family. According to the present results, MLH1 does not have a major role in PRCA causation in Finland.
16941491	Unique substitution of CHEK2 and TP53 mutations implicated in primary prostate tumors and cancer cell lines.	Genetic defects in CHEK2 and TP53 have been implicated in prostate cancer development. However, the interaction of these two genes in prostate cancer tumorigenesis has not been investigated. We previously described 11 CHEK2 mutations in a group of 84 primary prostate tumors. In this report, we screened the same group of tumors for TP53 mutations and revealed nine somatic and two germline mutations. One germline TP53 mutation (c.408A > T/p.Gln136His) and two somatic mutations (c.1022T > G/p.Phe341Cys and c.108-109ins22/p.His37fsX13) are novel to human cancer. More interestingly, CHEK2 and TP53 mutations were observed to be mutually substituted in these tumors. Analysis of five commonly used prostate cancer cell lines revealed that four cell lines harboring TP53 mutations carry no CHEK2 mutation while the only cell line (LNCaP) carrying wild-type TP53  harbors a CHEK2 mutation. The novel CHEK2 mutation (c.1160C>T/p.Thr387Asn) identified in LNCaP cells changes amino acid Thr387 to Asn which has been shown to impair CHEK2 autophosphorylation and activation. Our data suggest that the CHEK2 and TP53 mutations can substitute each other in at least 25% (21/84) of prostate cancers and that DNA damage-signaling pathway plays an important role in prostate cancer tumorigenesis.
16835864	Characterization of CHEK2 mutations in prostate cancer.	The checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2, also known as CHK2) is a tumor suppressor that participates in the DNA damage-signaling pathway. It is phosphorylated and activated following DNA damage, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Previously, we reported germline CHEK2 mutations in patients with prostate cancer. In this study, we have identified two novel somatic CHEK2 mutations, c.349A > G (p.R117G) and c.967A > C (p.E321K), in prostate tumor specimens and investigated the functions of these mutants in vivo. We have shown that most of the germline CHEK2 mutations and one somatic mutation (p.R117G) within FHA domain have modestly reduced CHEK2 kinase activity in comparison with wild-type CHEK2 while the other somatic mutation (p.E321K) within the kinase domain of CHEK2 totally abolished CHEK2 kinase activity. Given that several clinical CHEK2 mutations reside in the Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, we further generated a  series of missense mutations within this domain and demonstrated the requirement  of an intact FHA domain for the full activation of CHEK2. Taken together, these results provide evidence that both germline and somatic CHEK2 mutations identified in prostate cancer may contribute to the development of prostate cancer through the reduction of CHEK2 activation in response to DNA damage and/or oncogenic stress.
16825437	Nordic collaborative study of the BARD1 Cys557Ser allele in 3956 patients with cancer: enrichment in familial BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation-negative breast cancer but not in other malignancies.	BACKGROUND: BARD1 was originally identified as a BRCA1-interacting protein but has also been described in tumour-suppressive functions independent of BRCA1. Several studies have indicated that the BARD1 gene is a potential target for germline changes predisposing to breast and ovarian cancer. The C-terminal Cys557Ser change has previously been uncovered to associate with an increased risk of breast cancer and was recently shown to result in defective apoptotic activities. AIM AND METHODS: Conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis, minisequencing, TaqMan assays, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and DNA sequencing were used to investigate the prevalence of the Cys557Ser allele in a large Nordic case-control study cohort consisting of 2906 patients with breast or ovarian cancer, 734 with prostate cancer, 188 with colorectal cancer, 128 men with breast cancer, and 3591 controls from Finland, Iceland, Denmark, Sweden and  Norway. RESULTS: The frequency of the BARD1 Cys557Ser variant seemed to increase among patients from families with breast or ovarian cancer lacking BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations: a significant difference was obtained compared with controls (6.8% v 2.7%; p<0.001; odds ratio (OR) 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 4.0) and  with patients from BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation-positive families (6.8% v 2.2%; p = 0.01; OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.2 to 8.3). In contrast, no major association with male breast, ovarian, colorectal or prostate cancer was observed. Additionally, a novel BARD1  allele resulting in Ser558Pro was identified in familial breast cancer cases. CONCLUSION: These results provide further evidence that BARD1 Cys557Ser confers a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in women.
16822847	FGFR4 Arg388 allele is associated with resistance to adjuvant therapy in primary  breast cancer.	PURPOSE: A recent study presented first evidence that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 388 of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) gene, causing a transmembrane domain missense mutation (Gly388Arg), is associated with disease outcome in node-positive breast cancer. This article addresses the clinical relevance of this SNP, FGFR4 genotype, phenotype, and HER2 regarding patient outcome and influence of adjuvant systemic therapy in a substantial primary breast cancer collective (n = 372; median follow-up, 94.5 months). METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of germ-line polymorphism was performed in uninvolved lymph nodes; FGFR4 and HER2 expression were assessed immunohistochemically in tissue microarrays. RESULTS: In 51% of patients, homo- or heterozygous Arg388 allele was present. No  correlation existed between FGFR4 genotype and expression or HER2 status. In node-negative patients, FGFR4 genotype was not correlated with disease outcome. In node-positive patients, however, FGFR4 Arg388 was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival (DFS; P = .02) and overall survival (OS; P = .04). Notably, this association seems to be attributable to relatively poor therapy response in Arg388 carriers, reflected in their significantly shorter DFS (P = .02) and OS (P = .045) among patients receiving adjuvant systemic therapy. It is also seen as a significant interaction term in a multivariate proportional  hazards model with Arg388 carriers having only about half as much benefit from adjuvant systemic therapy as wild-type carriers. CONCLUSION: According to this study, FGFR4 Arg388 genotype is a marker for breast cancer progression in patients with adjuvant systemic therapy, particularly chemotherapy, and thus may indicate therapy resistance.
16760288	Y179C, F486L and N550H are BRCA1 variants that may be associated with breast cancer in a Sicilian family: results of a 5-year GOIM (Gruppo Oncologico dell'Italia Meridionale) prospective study.	BACKGROUND: Over 600 different pathogenic mutations have been identified in the BRCA1 gene. Nevertheless, numerous missense mutations of unknown biological function still exist. Understanding of biological significance of these mutations should help in genetic counselling to carriers and their families. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 104 patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer whose genetic counselling answered the criteria of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO 2003), were prospectively screened for mutations in all coding exons of the BRCA1 gene by automatic direct sequencing. RESULTS: During these mutational screening procedures one case presented three mutations classified in the Breast Cancer Information Core Database as unknown variants. These were 655A/G found in exon 8 of BRCA1, 1575T/C and 1767A/C found in exon 11 of the same gene. The identification of the three unknown variants in  the proband (16SIRIO) and in her mother and sister indicates that such alterations exist in cis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the charge and stechiometry variations determined by the changes in the amino acids Y179C, F486L and N550H might produce an effect on the conformation of the protein and, consequently, on its function.
16741917	The DU145 human prostate carcinoma cell line harbors a temperature-sensitive allele of p53.	BACKGROUND: Some nuances of mutant and wild-type p53 activity have been uncovered utilizing temperature sensitive (TS) alleles. However, few human tumor derived cell lines possess a TS p53 mutant. METHODS: The cell lines DU145 (heterozygous p53, P223L, and V274F) and PC3 (p53-null, where exogenous P223L and V274F were introduced individually or in combination) were examined for TS p53 activity as revealed by reporter construct  and target gene activation. RESULTS: TS p53 function was observed in DU145 and expression of the P223L allele in PC3 conferred a TS p53 profile. Activation of p21Waf1 demonstrated that P223L  TS activity may have been influenced by cellular context. CONCLUSIONS: The DU145 cell line harbors a TS mutant of p53 and, in addition to being a widely used model of human prostate carcinoma, may also reveal new insights into p53 function due to the unique transcriptional properties of its TS phenotype.
16652348	The ATM missense mutation p.Ser49Cys (c.146C>G) and the risk of breast cancer.	Homozygous mutation in the ATM gene causes ataxia telangiectasia and heterozygous mutation carriers may be at increased risk of breast cancer. We studied a total of 22 ATM variants; 18 variants were analyzed in one of two large population-based studies from the U.S. and Poland, and four variants were analyzed in all 2,856 breast cancer cases and 3,344 controls from the two studies. The missense mutation Ser49Cys (c.146C>G, p.S49C), carried by approximately 2% of subjects, was more common in cases than controls in both study populations, combined odds ratio (OR) 1.69 (95% CI, 1.19-2.40; P=0.004). Another missense mutation at approximately 2% frequency, Phe858Leu (c.2572T>C, p.F858L), was associated with a significant increased risk in the U.S. study but  not in Poland, and had a combined OR of 1.44 (95% CI, 0.98-2.11; P=0.06). These analyses provide the most convincing evidence thus far that missense mutations in ATM, particularly p.S49C, may be breast cancer susceptibility alleles. Because of their low frequency, even larger sample sizes are required to more firmly establish these associations.
16563154	Influence of the MDM2 single nucleotide polymorphism SNP309 on tumour development in BRCA1 mutation carriers.	BACKGROUND: The MDM2 gene encodes a negative regulator of the p53 tumour suppressor protein. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MDM2 promoter (a T to G exchange at nucleotide 309) has been reported to produce accelerated tumour formation in individuals with inherited p53 mutations. We have investigated the effect of the MDM2 SNP309 on clinical outcome in a cohort of patients with germline mutations of BRCA1. METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained for 102 healthy controls and 116 patients with  established pathogenic mutations of BRCA1 and Pyrosequencing technologytrade mark was used to determine the genotype at the MDM2 SNP309 locus. RESULTS: The polymorphism was present in 52.9% of the controls (G/T in 37.3% and  G/G in 15.6%) and 58.6% of the BRCA1 mutation carriers (47.4% G/T and 11.2% G/G). Incidence of malignancy in female BRCA1 carriers was not significantly higher in  SNP309 carriers than in wildtype (T/T) individuals (72.7% vs. 75.6%, p = 1.00). Mean age of diagnosis of first breast cancer was 41.2 years in the SNP309 G/G genotype carriers, 38.6 years in those with the SNP309 G/T genotype and 39.0 years in wildtype subjects (p = 0.80). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that the MDM2 SNP309 accelerates tumour development in carriers of known pathogenic germline mutations of BRCA1.
16503999	HFE H63D mutation frequency shows an increase in Turkish women with breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: The hereditary hemochromatosis gene HFE plays a pivotal role in iron  homeostasis. The association between cancer and HFE hetero- or homozygosity has previously been shown including hepatocellular and nonhepatocellular malignancies. This study was performed to compare frequencies of HFE C282Y and H63D variants in Turkish women with breast cancer and healthy controls. METHODS: Archived DNA samples of Hacettepe University Oncology Institute were used in this study. The HFE gene was investigated by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: All subjects studied were free from C282Y mutation. Thirty-nine patients had H63D mutation and were all heterozygous. H63D allele frequency was 22.2% (39/176) in the breast cancer patients, and 14% (28/200) in the healthy volunteers. Statistical analysis of cases with HFE H63D phenotype showed significant difference between breast cancer and healthy volunteers (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HFE H63D mutation frequencies were increased in the breast cancer patients in comparison to those in the general population. Also, odds ratios (odds ratio = 2.05) computed in this study suggest that H63D has a positive association with breast cancer.
16434975	The R273H p53 mutation can facilitate the androgen-independent growth of LNCaP by a mechanism that involves H2 relaxin and its cognate receptor LGR7.	Mutations in p53 occur at a rate of approximately 70% in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (CaP), suggesting that p53 mutations facilitate the progression of CaP to androgen-independent (AI) growth. We have previously reported that transfection of p53 gain of function mutant alleles into LNCaP, an androgen-sensitive cell line, allows for AI growth of LNCaP in vitro. We herein confirm the in vivo relevance of those findings by demonstrating that the R273H p53 mutation (p53(R273H)) facilitates AI growth in castrated nude mice. In addition, we demonstrate that H2 relaxin is responsible for facilitating p53(R273H)-mediated AI CaP. H2 relaxin is overexpressed in the LNCaP-R273H subline. Downregulation of H2 relaxin expression results in significant inhibition of AI growth, whereas addition of recombinant human H2 relaxin to parental LNCaP promotes AI growth. Inhibition of AI growth was also achieved by blocking expression of LGR7, the cognate receptor of H2 relaxin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was used to demonstrate that p53(R273H) binds directly to the relaxin promoter, further confirming a role for H2 relaxin signaling in p53(R273H)-mediated AI CaP. Lastly, we used a reporter gene assay to demonstrate that H2 relaxin can induce the expression of prostate-specific antigen via an androgen receptor-mediated pathway.
16333312	BARD1 variants Cys557Ser and Val507Met in breast cancer predisposition.	BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING-domain 1) is a tumor suppressor whose protein product interacts with BRCA1, and in which rare somatic and germline mutations have been reported in breast, uterine, and endometrial cancers. We aimed to evaluate whether there are BARD1 genetic variants that contribute to breast cancer risk by screening the gene for germline alterations in 45 Finnish familial breast cancer patients and in seven patients with both breast and ovarian cancer. Two of the missense alterations identified (Cys557Ser and Val507Met) were recently suggested to associate with an increased breast cancer risk. We also analyzed these variants in large and independent series of familial and unselected breast cancer patients and healthy controls. No clearly deleterious mutations were detected in the initial mutation screening. No association of the  Cys557Ser and breast cancer risk was observed as the variant was found altogether in 1.4% (16/1181) of familial and 2.2% (34/1565) of unselected breast cancer patients, and in 2.5% (27/1083) of healthy controls. The frequency of the Val-allele of the Val507Met variant was modestly higher among breast cancer patients than among healthy controls, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. No statistically significant association of the Cys557Ser or Val507Met variants with any clinicopathologic parameters was observed. These results suggest that the contribution of the BARD1 germline variants to breast cancer predisposition is very limited, and that neither Cys557Ser nor Val507Met have an effect on familial breast cancer susceptibility.
16282370	Stress kinase signaling regulates androgen receptor phosphorylation, transcription, and localization.	Activation of signal transduction kinase cascades is known to alter androgen receptor (AR) activity, but the molecular mechanisms are still poorly defined. Here we show that stress kinase signaling regulates Ser 650 phosphorylation and AR nuclear export. In LNCaP prostate cancer cells, activation of either MAPK kinase (MKK) 4:c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or MKK6:p38 signaling pathways increased Ser 650 phosphorylation, whereas pharmacologic inhibition of JNK or p38 signaling led to a reduction of AR Ser 650 phosphorylation. Both p38alpha and JNK1 phosphorylated Ser 650 in vitro. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of either MKK4 or MKK6 increased endogenous prostate-specific antigen (PSA) transcript levels, and this increase was blocked by either bicalutamide or AR small interfering RNA. Stress kinase inhibition of PSA transcription is, therefore, dependent on the AR. Similar experiments involving either activation or inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase:ERK signaling had little effect on Ser 650 phosphorylation or PSA mRNA levels. Ser 650 is proximal to the DNA binding domain that contains a nuclear export signal. Mutation of Ser 650 to alanine reduced nuclear export of the AR, whereas mutation of Ser 650 to the phosphomimetic amino acid aspartate restored AR nuclear export. Pharmacologic inhibition of stress kinase signaling reduced wild-type AR nuclear export equivalent to the S650A mutant without affecting nuclear export of the S650D mutant. Our data suggest that stress kinase signaling and nuclear export regulate AR transcriptional activity.
16280053	Mutation analysis of FANCD2, BRIP1/BACH1, LMO4 and SFN in familial breast cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Mutations in known predisposition genes account for only about a third of all multiple-case breast cancer families. We hypothesized that germline  mutations in FANCD2, BRIP1/BACH1, LMO4 and SFN may account for some of the unexplained multiple-case breast cancer families. METHODS: The families used in this study were ascertained through the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer (kConFab). Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis of  the coding regions of these four genes was conducted in the youngest affected cases of 30 to 267 non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer families. In addition, a further 399 index cases were also screened for mutations in two functionally significant regions of the FANCD2 gene and 253 index cases were screened for two previously reported mutations in BACH1 (p. P47A and p. M299I). RESULTS: DHPLC analysis of FANCD2 identified six silent exonic variants, and a large number of intronic variants, which tagged two common haplotypes. One protein truncating variant was found in BRIP1/BACH1, as well as four missense variants, a silent change and a variant in the 3' untranslated region. No missense or splice site mutations were found in LMO4 or SFN. Analysis of the missense, silent and frameshift variants of FANCD2 and BACH1 in relatives of the  index cases, and in a panel of controls, found no evidence suggestive of pathogenicity. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that highly penetrant exonic or splice site mutations in FANCD2, BRIP1/BACH1, LMO4 or SFN contribute to familial breast cancer. Large scale association studies will be necessary to determine whether any of the polymorphisms or haplotypes identified in these genes contributes to breast cancer risk.
16172807	Nucleotide variations in genes encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 and serine proteinase inhibitor B10 associated with prostate cancer.	Genes encoding the serine proteinase inhibitor B family (SERPINBs) are mainly clustered on human chromosome 18 (18q21). Several serpins are known to affect malignant phenotypes of tumor cells, so aberrant genetic variants in this molecular family are candidates for conferring susceptibility for risk of cancer. We investigated whether eight selected non-synonymous variations within SERPINB loci at 18q21 might be associated with risk of prostate cancer in Japanese men. A case-control study involving 292 prostate-cancer patients and 384 controls revealed significant differences in regard to distribution of four missense variations in genes encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) and SERPINB10. The most significant association was detected for the N120D polymorphism in the PAI2 gene (P = 5.0 x 10(-5)); men carrying the 120-N allele (120-N/N and 120-N/D genotypes) carried a 2.4-fold increased risk of prostate cancer (95% confidence interval 1.45-4.07). Associations were also detected for three other missense polymorphisms in those two genes. Strong linkage disequilibrium in the region encompassing PAI2 and SERPINB10 extended to about 50 kbp. The results suggested that missense variations in one or both of these genes confer important risks for prostate cancer, and may be themselves tumorigenic. Although confirmative replication studies on larger cohorts are awaited, clinical examination of these variations may become useful for identifying individuals at  high risk for prostate cancer.
16168123	Strong evidence that the common variant S384F in BRCA2 has no pathogenic relevance in hereditary breast cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Unclassified variants (UVs) of unknown clinical significance are frequently detected in the BRCA2 gene. In this study, we have investigated the potential pathogenic relevance of the recurrent UV S384F (BRCA2, exon 10). METHODS: For co-segregation, four women from a large kindred (BN326) suffering from breast cancer were analysed. Moreover, paraffin-embedded tumours from two patients were analysed for loss of heterozygosity. Co-occurrence of the variant with a deleterious mutation was further determined in a large data set of 43,029  index cases. Nature and position of the UV and conservation among species were evaluated. RESULTS: We identified the unclassified variant S384F in three of the four breast cancer patients (the three were diagnosed at 41, 43 and 57 years of age). One woman with bilateral breast cancer (diagnosed at ages 32 and 50) did not carry the variant. Both tumours were heterozygous for the S384F variant, so loss of the wild-type allele could be excluded. Ser384 is not located in a region of functional importance and cross-species sequence comparison revealed incomplete conservation in the human, dog, rodent and chicken BRCA2 homologues. Overall, the variant was detected in 116 patients, five of which co-occurred with different deleterious mutations. The combined likelihood ratio of co-occurrence, co-segregation and loss of heterozygosity revealed a value of 1.4 x 10-8 in favour of neutrality of the variant. CONCLUSION: Our data provide conclusive evidence that the S384F variant is not a  disease causing mutation.
16123141	Molecular characterization of ring finger protein 11.	Ring finger proteins serve many vital functions within the cell. We have identified RNF11, a novel 154-amino acid ring finger-containing protein, which is elevated in breast cancer. Within its ring finger domain, RNF11 contains an AKT phosphorylation site (T135) that is situated within a 14-3-3 binding domain. In WM239 cells with constitutively active AKT, RNF11 exhibits seven distinct phosphopeptides as measured using two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. Upon inhibition of the AKT pathway or mutation of T135, the phosphorylation at one of  these sites is virtually eliminated, suggesting that AKT may phosphorylate RNF11  at T135. Moreover, RNF11 is phosphorylated by AKT in vitro and is recognized by phospho-AKT substrate antibodies. RNF11 shows enhanced binding to 14-3-3 in WM239 cells compared with that seen in the parental WM35 cells which have low AKT activity. Furthermore, treatment of WM239 cells with LY294002 reduces RNF11/14-3-3 interactions suggesting that RNF11/14-3-3 binding is regulated by AKT. In addition, RNF11/14-3-3 binding is enhanced by constitutively active AKT and is diminished by dominant-negative AKT. There is also reduced 14-3-3 binding  to T135E RNF11. RNF11 localization was altered from the cytoplasm to the nucleus  by activated AKT. Thus, phosphorylation of RNF11 by AKT either causes its nuclear localization or induces degradation of cytoplasmic RNF11. In addition, T135E RNF11, which does not bind 14-3-3 and is not phosphorylated by AKT, causes a greater enhancement of transforming growth factor-beta signaling than wild-type RNF11. It is clear that RNF11 function, localization, and potentially, degradation are regulated by AKT. Disregulation of proper RNF11 function by AKT may prove to be detrimental to patient outcomes, making RNF11 a potential target  for novel cancer therapeutics.
16061562	Identification and characterization of missense alterations in the BRCA1 associated RING domain (BARD1) gene in breast and ovarian cancer.	BACKGROUND: BRCA1 associated RING domain protein (BARD1) was originally identified due to its interaction with the RING domain of BRCA1. BARD1 is required for S phase progression, contact inhibition and normal nuclear division, as well as for BRCA1 independent, p53 dependent apoptosis. METHODS: To investigate whether alterations in BARD1 are involved in human breast and ovarian cancer, we used single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and  sequencing on 35 breast tumours and cancer cell lines and on 21 ovarian tumours. RESULTS: Along with the G2355C (S761N) missense mutation previously identified in a uterine cancer, we found two other variants in breast cancers, T2006C (C645R) and A2286G (I738V). The T2006C (C645R) mutation was also found in one ovarian tumour. A variant of uncertain consequence, G1743C (C557S), was found to be homozygous or hemizygous in an ovarian tumour. Eleven variants of BARD1 were characterised with respect to known functions of BARD1. None of the variants appears to affect localisation or interaction with BRCA1; however, putative disease associated alleles appear to affect the stability of p53. These same mutations also appear to abrogate the growth suppressive and apoptotic activities of BARD1. CONCLUSIONS: These activities allowed us to identify one of the rare variants (A2286G; I738V) as a neutral polymorphism rather than a detrimental mutation, and suggested that G1743C (C557S) is not a polymorphism but may contribute to the cancer phenotype.
16039774	The 5alpha-reductase type II A49T and V89L high-activity allelic variants are more common in men with prostate cancer compared with the general population.	OBJECTIVES: To compare men with prostate disease with those from the general population regarding polymorphisms in the androgen receptor gene and in the 5alpha-reductase II (SRD5A2) gene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SRD5A2 polymorphisms A49T, V89L and R227Q, the androgen receptor CAG and GGN repeats and sex hormone status was investigated in  men with prostate cancer (CaP) (n=89), benign prostate hyperplasia (n=45) and healthy military conscripts (n=223). RESULTS: The SRD5A2 high-activity allele variants A49T AT and V89L LL were more frequent in CaP-patients compared to general population, p=0.026 and p=0.05, respectively. CaP progression was, however, independent of SRD5A2 variants. In contrary, men with GGN<23 had a higher risk of dying from the disease than their  counterparts with longer repeats. CONCLUSIONS: Men with CaP were more often genetically predisposed to a higher enzymatic activity in the turn over from T to DHT compared to the general population. In our population, androgen receptor genotype affected CaP outcome.
15870154	Cytochrome P-450 1A1 gene polymorphisms and risk of breast cancer: a HuGE review.	Cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 1A1 plays a key role in phase I metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and in estrogen metabolism. It is expressed predominantly in extrahepatic tissues, including the breast. Four CYP1A1 gene polymorphisms (3801T --> C, Ile462Val, 3205T --> C, and Thr461Asp) have been studied in relation to breast cancer. The 3801C variant is more common than the Val variant. Both variants occur more frequently in Asians than in White populations. The 3205T --> C polymorphism has been observed in African Americans only. Little data are available on the geographic/ethnic distribution of the Thr461Asp polymorphism. The functional significance of the polymorphisms is unclear. In 17  studies, no consistent association between breast cancer and CYP1A1 genotype was  found. Meta-analysis found no significant risk for the genotypes 1) 3801C/C (relative risk (RR) = 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52, 1.80) or 3801T/C  (RR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.70, 1.19) versus 3801T/T, 2) Val/Val (RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.63, 1.74) or Ile/Val (RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.76, 1.10) versus Ile/Ile, or 3) Asp/Asp (RR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.20, 4.49) or Thr/Asp (RR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.43) versus Thr/Thr. Future studies should explore possible interactions between CYP1A1 and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, markers of estrogen exposure, other lifestyle factors influencing hormonal levels, and other genes involved in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism or hormonal biosynthesis.
15863270	The missense mutations in the candidate prostate cancer gene ELAC2 do not alter enzymatic properties of its product.	The candidate prostate cancer gene ELAC2 encodes tRNA 3' processing endoribonuclease (tRNase ZL). We produced recombinant human tRNase ZL's, which contain one to three amino-acid substitutions from three missense mutations (Ser217Leu, Ala541Thr, and Arg781His) that are associated with the occurrence of  prostate cancer. These enzymes were examined for the pre-tRNA cleavage and the RNase 65 activity. We did not observe any differences in enzymatic properties such as Km and k(cat) values between the wild-type tRNase ZL and its variants. We conclude that there is no causality between the enzymatic properties of tRNase ZL and the prostate cancer.
15714208	Mutation screening and association study of RNASEL as a prostate cancer susceptibility gene.	To date, germline mutations have been found in three candidate genes for hereditary prostate cancer: ELAC2 at 17p11, RNASEL at 1q25 and MSR1 at 8p22. RNASEL, encoding the 2',5'-oligoadenylate-dependant RNase L, seems to have rare mutations in different ethnicities, such as M1I in Afro-Americans, E265X in men of European descent and 471delAAAG in Ashkenazi Jews. In order to evaluate the relevance of RNASEL in the German population, we sequenced its open reading frame to determine the spectrum and frequency of germline mutations. The screen included 303 affected men from 136 Caucasian families, of which 45 met the criteria for hereditary prostate cancer. Variants were analysed using a family-based association test, and genotyped in an additional 227 sporadic prostate cancer patients and 207 controls. We identified only two sib pairs (1.4% of our families) cosegregating conspicuous RNASEL variants with prostate cancer:  the nonsense mutation E265X, and a new amino-acid substitution (R400P) of unknown functional relevance. Both alleles were also found at low frequencies (1.4 and 0.5%, respectively) in controls. No significant association of polymorphisms (I97L, R462Q and D541E) was observed, neither in case-control analyses nor by family-based association tests. In contrast to previous reports, our study does not suggest that common variants (i.e. R462Q) modify disease risk. Our results are not consistent with a high penetrance of deleterious RNASEL mutations. Due to the low frequency of germline mutations present in our sample, RNASEL does not have a significant impact on prostate cancer susceptibility in the German population.
15665273	Down-regulation of BRCA1-BARD1 ubiquitin ligase by CDK2.	BRCA1, a breast and ovarian tumor suppressor, is a phosphoprotein whose cellular  expression level is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. BRCA1 interacts with BARD1 to generate significant ubiquitin ligase activity which catalyzes nontraditional Lys-6-linked polyubiquitin chains. However, it is not clear how the activity is regulated and how this affects BRCA1's multiple cellular functions. Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase activity of BRCA1-BARD1 is down-regulated by CDK2. During the cell cycle, BARD1 expression can largely be categorized into three patterns: moderately expressed in a predominantly unphosphorylated form in early G(1) phase, expressed at low levels in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms during late G(1) and S phases, and highly expressed in its phosphorylated form during mitosis coinciding with BRCA1  expression. CDK2-cyclin A1/E1 and CDK1-cyclin B1 phosphorylate BARD1 on its NH(2) terminus in vivo and in vitro. Intriguingly, the BRCA1-BARD1-mediated in vivo ubiquitination of nucleophosmin/B23 (NPM) and autoubiquitination of BRCA1 are dramatically disrupted by coexpression of CDK2-cyclin A1/E1, but not by CDK1-cyclin B1. The inhibition of ubiquitin ligase activity is not due to the direct effect of the kinases on BARD1 because an unphosphorylatable mutant of BARD1, S148A/S251A/S288A/T299A, is still inhibited by CDK2-cyclin E1. Alternatively, BRCA1 and BARD1 are likely exported to the cytoplasm and their expressions are remarkably reduced by CDK2-cyclin E1 coexpression. Recognizing the importance of cyclin E1 overexpression in breast cancer development, these results suggest a CDK2-BRCA1-NPM pathway that coordinately functions in cell growth and tumor progression pathways.
15649950	Functional and genomic approaches reveal an ancient CHEK2 allele associated with  breast cancer in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.	Functional and genomic approaches can be integrated to screen efficiently for pathogenic alleles in founder populations. We applied such approaches to analysis of the cancer-associated cell cycle regulator CHEK2 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. We first identified two extended haplotypes at CHEK2 that co-segregated with breast cancer in high-risk families. We sequenced CHEK2 in a case representing each haplotype and discovered two novel amino acid substitutions, CHEK2.S428F in the kinase domain and CHEK2.P85L in the N-terminal  region. To assay these alleles for loss of CHEK2 function, we tested their capacity to complement Rad53 deletion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. CHEK2.S428F failed to complement Rad53 and thus largely abrogates normal CHEK2 function, whereas CHEK2.P85L complemented Rad53 as well as did wild-type CHEK2. Epidemiologic analyses were concordant with the functional tests. Frequencies of  CHEK2.S428F heterozygotes were 2.88% (47/1632) among female breast cancer patients not selected for family history or age at diagnosis and 1.37% (23/1673)  among controls (OR=2.13, 95% CI [1.26, 3.69], P=0.004), whereas frequencies of CHEK2.P85L were 0.92% among cases and 0.83% among controls. On the basis of the experience of mothers, sisters and daughters of probands, breast cancer risk due  to CHEK2.S428F was estimated as 0.17 (+/-0.08) by age 60. We conclude that CHEK2.S428F increases breast cancer risk approximately 2-fold among Ashkenazi Jewish women, whereas CHEK2.P85L is a neutral allele. In general, these results suggest that selecting probands with extended haplotypes that co-segregate with disease can improve the efficiency of resequencing efforts and that quantitative  complementation tests in yeast can be used to evaluate variants in genes with highly conserved function.
15617028	Androgen receptor mutants detected in recurrent prostate cancer exhibit diverse functional characteristics.	BACKGROUND: Alterations in the function of androgen receptor (AR) and its signaling pathway may be responsible for the progression of prostate cancer. The  goal of the present study was to investigate the potential roles of AR structural and functional alterations in the progression of prostate cancer, and the relationship between the structure and function of the AR. METHODS: AR gene in 58 prostate cancer samples was examined for mutations using PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. Effects of mutations on the structure and function of AR were investigated by androgen-binding assays and transactivation assays, respectively. RESULTS: Four novel somatic mutations (G142V, D221H, E872Q, and M886I) were identified from recurrent prostate cancer samples. None of the AR mutants differed from wild-type AR (wtAR) in their abilities to bind the synthetic androgen methyltrienolone. However, these mutated AR exhibited diverse functional characteristics as compared with wtAR. G142V and D221H showed increased responses to DHT. E872Q could be abnormally activated by 17beta-estradiol, progesterone, and cyproterone acetate (CPA). Furthermore, E872Q and M886I presented increased responses to DHT in the presence of coactivators TIF-2 and CBP, but not p300. On  the other hand, although overexpression of corepressors N-CoR and SMRT could result in evident inhibition on DHT- or CPA-induced transactivity of wtAR and the AR mutants, N-CoR displayed stronger inhibitory effects on DHT-induced transactivity of the AR mutants (especially for E872Q and M886I) than that of wtAR. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of enhanced inhibitory effects of corepressors on the transactivity of the AR mutants found in prostate  cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here demonstrate that AR mutants found in prostate cancer had different functional alterations, which might play an important role in the progression of prostate cancer.
15342448	Glutathione S-transferases M1, T1, and P1 and breast cancer: a pooled analysis.	The glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes are involved in the metabolism of various carcinogens. Deletion polymorphisms in the genes GSTM1 and GSTT1 and a base transition polymorphism at codon 105 (Ile-->Val) in GSTP1 were investigated  in relation to breast cancer risk. Tobacco smoking and reproductive factors were  examined as potential effect modifiers. Individual data from seven case-control studies were pooled within the International Collaborative Study on Genetic Susceptibility to Environmental Carcinogens. To measure the effect of GSTs on breast cancer risk, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed adjusting for study center and age. The modifying effect was investigated by stratification on variables of smoking habits and reproductive history. A total of 2,048 cases with breast cancer and 1,969 controls were analyzed. The relative  odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of breast cancer was 0.98 (0.86-1.12) with the GSTM1 null, 1.11 (0.87-1.41) with the GSTT1 null, 1.01 (0.79-1.28) with GSTP1 heterozygous mutants, and 0.93 (0.62-1.38) with GSTP1 homozygous mutants. Stratification by smoking or reproductive factors did not reveal a modifying effect of these variables, nor was there any association between GSTM1 and age at diagnosis of breast cancer. This is the largest study investigating susceptibility to breast cancer due to polymorphisms in the GST genes. The results conclusively show that single gene GST polymorphisms do not confer a substantial risk of breast cancer to its carriers. Furthermore, GSTs did not interact with smoking or reproductive history to modify cancer risk.
15235021	Germline E-cadherin mutations in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: assessment of 42 new families and review of genetic screening criteria.	BACKGROUND: Mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene are a well documented cause of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Development of evidence based guidelines for CDH1 screening for HDGC have been complicated by its rarity, variable penetrance, and lack of founder mutations. METHODS: Forty three new gastric cancer (GC) families were ascertained from multiple sources. In 42 of these families at least one gastric cancer was pathologically confirmed to be a diffuse gastric cancer (DGC); the other family had intestinal type gastric cancers. Screening of the entire coding region of the CDH1 gene and all intron/exon boundaries was performed by bi-directional sequencing. RESULTS: Novel mutations were found in 13 of the 42 DGC families (31% overall). Twelve of these mutations occur among the 25 families with multiple cases of gastric cancer and with pathologic confirmation of diffuse gastric cancer phenotype in at least one individual under the age of 50 years. The mutations found include small insertions and deletions, splice site mutations, and three non-conservative amino acid substitutions (A298T, W409R, and R732Q). All three missense mutations conferred loss of E-cadherin function in in vitro assays. Multiple cases of breast cancers including pathologically confirmed lobular breast cancers were observed both in mutation positive and negative families. CONCLUSION: Germline truncating CDH1 mutations are found in 48% of families with  multiple cases of gastric cancer and at least one documented case of DGC in an individual under 50 years of age. We recommend that these criteria be used for selecting families for CDH1 mutational analysis.
15217503	No germline mutations in the histone acetyltransferase gene EP300 in BRCA1 and BRCA2 negative families with breast cancer and gastric, pancreatic, or colorectal cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, TP53, CHK2 and PTEN account for many, but not all, multiple-case breast and ovarian cancer families. The histone  acetyltransferase gene EP300 may function as a tumour suppressor gene because it  is sometimes somatically mutated in breast, colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancers, and is located on a region of chromosome 22 that frequently undergoes loss of heterozygosity in many cancer types. We hypothesized that germline mutations in EP300 may account for some breast cancer families that include cases of gastric, pancreatic and/or colorectal cancer. METHODS: We screened the entire coding region of EP300 for mutations in the youngest affected members of 23 non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast cancer families with at least one confirmed case of gastric, pancreatic and/or colorectal cancer. These families were ascertained in Australia through the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation  Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer. RESULTS: Denaturing HPLC analysis identified a heterozygous alteration at codon 211, specifically a GGC to AGC (glycine to serine) alteration, in two individuals. This conservative amino acid change was not within any known functional domains of EP300. The frequency of the Ser211 variant did not differ significantly between a series of 352 breast cancer patients (4.0%) and 254 control individuals (2.8%; P = 0.5). CONCLUSION: The present study does not support a major role for EP300 mutations in breast and ovarian cancer families with a history of gastric, pancreatic and/or colorectal cancer.
15170666	The variant E233G of the RAD51D gene could be a low-penetrance allele in high-risk breast cancer families without BRCA1/2 mutations.	Six SNPs have been detected in the DNA repair genes RAD51C and RAD51D, not previously characterized. The novel variant E233G in RAD51D is more highly represented in high-risk, site-specific, familial breast cancer cases that are not associated with the BRCA1/2 genes, with a frequency of 5.74% (n = 174) compared to a control population (n = 567) and another subset of breast cancer patients (n = 765) with a prevalence of around 2% only (comparison to controls, OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.12-6.03; p < 0.021). We found that the immunohistochemical profile detected in available tumors from these patients differs slightly from those described in non-BRCA1/2 tumors. Finally, the structural prediction of the  putative functional consequence of this change indicates that it can diminish protein stability and structure. This suggests a role for E233G as a low-penetrance susceptibility gene in the specific subgroup of high-risk familial breast cancer cases that are not related to BRCA1/2.
15146458	Identification of a functional mutation in pp32r1 (ANP32C).	No mutations or polymorphisms have previously been reported in pp32r1 (ANP32C; GenBank: AF008216.1). pp32r1 is part of the highly conserved ANP32 family, some of whose members are associated with control of histone acetylation, mRNA stability, and specialized forms of apoptosis. Although 87.6% identical at the protein level, pp32r1 is functionally distinct from pp32 (ANP32A) in its failure  to suppress oncogenesis in in vitro transformation systems and its tumorigenicity in in vivo assays. The present study found that pp32r1 expression levels vary among human tumor cell lines, with the highest levels found in prostatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. pp32r1 also appears to be polymorphic at nucleotide g.4520 and nucleotide g.4664 in human tobacco-associated oral mucosal lesions, human fibroblast cell lines, and several carcinoma cell lines. PC-3 human prostatic adenocarcinoma cells likewise appear to be polymorphic at these loci, but additionally contain a g.4870T>C transversion mutation. The mutation results  in a p.Tyr140His substitution, which lies in a functionally important region of the molecule. In the PC-3 prostate cancer line, the mutation is either homozygous, or hemizygous accompanied by loss of heterozygosity. ACHN cells stably transfected with pp32r1 containing this mutation showed a markedly increased rate of growth. The pp32r1 mutation could thus be causally associated with the neoplastic growth properties of PC-3, and be of potential clinical significance.
15101044	Functional consequences of ATM sequence variants for chromosomalradiosensitivity.	 The ATM [for ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) mutated] protein plays a key role in the detection and cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been described in the ATM gene; however, their association with cancer risk or radiosensitivity remains to be fully established. In this study, the functional consequences of specific ATM SNPs on in vitro radiosensitivity, as assessed by micronuclei (MN) formation, were measured in lymphoblastoid cell lines established from 10 breast cancer (BC) patients carrying different ATM missense SNPs, six A-T patients, six A-T heterozygotes (A-T het), and six normal individuals. The BC, A-T het, and A-T cell line groups showed significantly higher mean levels of MN formation after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) than did the group containing normal cell lines, with similar levels in the BC and A-T het groups. Within the BC lines studied, the group composed of the six carrying the linked 2572T>C (858F>L) and 3161C>G (1054P>R) variants had a higher level of MN after IR exposure compared to that observed in the remaining four BC or in the normal cell lines. This increase was not related to the constitutive ATM mRNA level, which was similar in these BC and the normal cell lines. Our results indicate that alterations in the ATM gene, including the presence of heterozygous mutations and the 2572C and 3161G variant  alleles, are associated with increased in vitro chromosomal radiosensitivity, perhaps by interfering with ATM function in a dominant-negative manner.
15059511	[Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes from breast cancer families in China Han people].	OBJECTIVE: To detect BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene germline mutation in the Chinese breast cancer families. METHODS: Samples of peripheral blood were collected to prepare genomic DNA by conventional techniques from 15 inherited breast cancer patients from 14 breast cancer families, 76 sporadic breast cancer patients, and 100 healthy controls based on informed consent. Exons 4, 8, 11 and 18 - 20 of BRCA1, and exons 1 - 14, 17 - 24 and 27 of BRCA2, were analyzed using DNA direct sequencing. RESULTS: Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found on the exon 11 of  BRCA1, 2 being silent changes without change of amino acid coding, and 4 with change of amino acid coding among which 2 were polymorphic amino acid alterations and 2 were pathogenic SNPs, i.e. mutational sites. One novel BRCA1 mutation, C1196T (Pro 359 Leu), was identified in a family breast cancer patients, who was  diagnosed at the age of 37. Another BRCA1 mutation, Trp 372 stop was found in a breast cancer patient who was diagnosed at the age 29. Eight SNPs were found on the exon3, 10 and 11 of BRCA2, among which 5 were silent changes and 3 were polymorphic amino acid alterations. A1093C (Asn289His) in exon 10 and A 3199G (Asn991Asp) in exon 11 being found simultaneously in the patients of 2 families but not appearing in pool DNA sample, and Asn 371 His appearing as A/C heterozygote in pool DNA sample. CONCLUSION: Two pathogenic SNPs have been found in BRCA1 and may be related to early-onset breast cancer. One of them may be a novel mutation characterized of familial breast cancer in China.
15042566	DNA adducts and p53 mutations in a patient with aristolochic acid-associated nephropathy.	BACKGROUND: Aristolochic acid-associated nephropathy (AAN) is a specific type of  renal disease that predisposes patients to a high risk of urothelial carcinoma. The authors have analyzed DNA from a patient who had urothelial malignancy 6 years after presenting with AAN and later had a breast carcinoma that metastasized to the liver. METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA was isolated from the primary breast tumor, the liver tumor, and the original urothelial malignancy and assayed for aristolochic acid (AA)-DNA adducts and mutations in the p53 gene. The adduct detected was the adenosine adduct of aristolochic acid I 7-(deoxyadenosin-N6-yl)aristolactam I (dA-AAI). In DNA from the breast and liver tumors the authors showed the same missense mutation in codon 245 (GGC-->GAC; Gly-->Asp) of exon 7 of p53. In contrast, DNA extracted from the urothelial tumor showed an AAG to TAG mutation in codon 139 (Lys-->Stop) of exon 5. CONCLUSION: A to T transversions, as observed here, are the typical mutations observed in the H-ras gene of tumors induced when rodents are treated with AA and correspond with DNA adduct formation at adenosine residues. These data indicate the probable molecular mechanism whereby AA causes urothelial malignancy.
14691288	Androgen receptor mutations in high-grade prostate cancer before hormonal therapy.	Androgen action is mediated through androgen receptor (AR), which appears to undergo structural and functional alterations during prostate cancer (CaP) progression. AR mutations have been infrequently reported in CaP before hormonal  therapy, but in untreated, advanced tumors AR mutations are suggested to be more  common. To investigate the frequency of AR mutations in aggressive CaP before hormonal therapy, we have analyzed AR coding region for aberrations in 21 paraffin-embedded prostate carcinoma samples (14 primary tumors, 7 metastases) of poor histologic differentiation. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism and  sequencing analyses revealed AR missense mutations in 29% (4/14) of the primary tumors and in one (14%) metastasis. Mutations resided in the transactivation domain and in the hinge region. One of the hinge region mutants, Ser646Phe, that  was identified in a patient with short endocrine therapy response, exhibited a markedly increased transcriptional activity on single androgen response element-containing promoters. In conclusion, AR mutations are frequent in high-grade CaP before initiation of hormonal therapy, and these mutations may play a role in poor therapy response and emergence of hormone-refractory CaP in some cases.
14683420	Applications of polymorphisms and pharmacogenomics in obstetrics and gynecology.	The number of reports investigating disease susceptibility based on the carriage  of low-penetrance, high-frequency polymorphisms has steadily increased over the last years. Evidence based on meta-analyses of individual case-control studies is accumulating, defining specific individual variations in disease susceptibility.  For example, genetic variations of the estradiol metabolism have been described as significant contributors to disease susceptibility with variations depending on ethnic background. In the field of obstetrics and gynecology, the genetic contribution of polymorphic markers to a series of disorders has been characterized. These disorders include recurrent pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia, endometriosis, breast cancer, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT)-related complications such as thrombosis. Among other genetic markers, thrombophilic genetic variants, such as the Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A polymorphisms, as well as genetic variants of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, for  example, CYP19 and CYP1B1, have been established as genetic risk markers and disease modifiers of recurrent and sporadic pregnancy loss and HRT-independent and -dependent breast cancer, respectively. In addition, meta-analyses of data in the literature established the TGFBR1*6A, GSTP I105V, and TP53 R72P polymorphisms, as well as the GSTM1 gene deletion as low-penetrance genetic risk  factors of sporadic breast cancer. With respect to genetic modulation of therapeutic effects, beneficial effects of estrogen replacement therapy and HRT are modulated by the carriage of single nucleotide polymorphisms, for example, osteoprotection and blood lipid changes by the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-a) PvuII polymorphism. Polymorphisms of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), ER-alpha, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and Factor V genes have been demonstrated to  modulate the timing of natural menopause. Lastly, a strong genetic contribution of polymorphisms to the development and the clinical course of endometriosis has  been established with data pointing to polymorphisms of the COMT, GST, NAT-2, and ER-alpha genes as susceptibility markers. In summary, the available evidence points to a number of polymorphisms of a wide variety of genes as strong hereditary determinants of the susceptibility to benign and malignant gynecologic and obstetric conditions.
14583476	Effects of RNase L mutations associated with prostate cancer on apoptosis induced by 2',5'-oligoadenylates.	The RNASEL gene, a strong candidate for the hereditary prostate cancer 1 allele (HPC1), encodes a single-stranded specific endoribonuclease involved in the antiviral actions of IFNs. RNase L is activated enzymatically after binding to unusual 5'-phosphorylated, 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A). Biostable phosphorothioate analogues of 2-5A were synthesized chemically and used to study  the effects of naturally occurring mutations and polymorphisms in RNASEL. The 2-5A analogues induced RNase L activity and caused apoptosis in cultures of late-stage, metastatic human prostate cancer cell lines DU145, PC3, and LNCaP. However, DU145 and PC3 cells were more sensitive to 2-5A than LNCaP cells, which  are heterozygous for an inactivating deletion mutation in RNase L. The RNase activities of missense variants of human RNase L were compared after expression in a mouse RNase L(-/-) cell line. Several variants (G59S, I97L, I220V, G296V, S322F, Y529C, and D541E) produced similar levels of RNase L activity as wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the R462Q variant, previously implicated in up to 13% of unselected prostate cancer cases, bound 2-5A at wild-type levels but had a 3-fold decrease in RNase activity. The deficiency in RNase L(R462Q) activity was correlated with a reduction in its ability to dimerize into a catalytically active form. Furthermore, RNase L(R462Q) was deficient in causing apoptosis in response to 2-5A consistent with its possible role in prostate cancer development. Our findings support the notion that RNASEL mutations and some variants allow tumor cells to escape a potent apoptotic pathway.
12949798	Ser217Leu polymorphism of the HPC2/ELAC2 gene associated with prostatic cancer risk in Japanese men.	The HPC2/ELAC2 gene may be associated with hereditary/familial prostate cancer (PCa). Two common missense variants (Ser217Leu and Ala541Thr) have been reported  in the gene. We performed mutational, allelotyping and expression analyses and a  molecular epidemiological study to clarify the relations between this gene and prostatic diseases, including PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in Japanese men. We screened for mutations in 109 patients with PCa including 11 patients from 1 hereditary and 9 familial PCa. Loss of heterozygosity and expression were analyzed. An epidemiological study was done in sporadic PCa (n=98) and BPH (n=143) using 1 novel (Ser627Leu) and 2 previously described polymorphisms of the HPC2/ELAC2 gene. Somatic or germline mutations were not confirmed in any cases of PCa. Loss of heterozygosity at 2 microsatellites, D17S1289 and D17S520, was detected in 1 of 38 and 1 of 35 cases, respectively. Expression analysis revealed decreased or absent mRNA expression in 6 of 38 tumors. Epidemiologic analysis showed that a Leu allele at codon 217 was significantly more frequent in patients with PCa than in controls (10.2% vs. 3.5%, odds ratio = 3.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-7.90). At codon 541, all patients with PCa or BPH and all control subjects had the Ala/Ala genotype. At codon 627, the incidence of the Leu variant was slightly, but not significantly,  higher in patients with BPH than in controls (7.0% vs. 2.8%, odds ratio = 2.59, 95% confidence interval, 0.94-7.13, not statistically significant). We concluded  that germline/somatic mutations of HPC2/ELAC2 are uncommon in PCa. Similarly, allelic imbalances at the gene locus and changes in expression are rare. Although no difference in allele frequency at Ser217Leu between patients with PCa and controls has been reported in a Western population, this polymorphism is a potential indicator of PCa risk in Japanese men and it should be examined in other ethnic groups.
12917204	The relationship between twenty missense ATM variants and breast cancer risk: the Multiethnic Cohort.	Deficiencies in tasks of detecting and repairing DNA damage lead to mutations and chromosomal abnormalities, a hallmark of cancer. The gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), ATM, is a proximal component in performing such tasks. Studies of A-T families have suggested an increased risk of breast cancer  among obligate female heterozygous carriers of ATM mutations. Paradoxically, studies of sporadic and familial breast cancer have failed to demonstrate an elevated prevalence of mutations among breast cancer cases. We characterized the  prevalence and distribution of 20 ATM missense mutations/polymorphisms in a population-based case-control study of 854 African-American, Latina, Japanese, and Caucasian women aged >/==" BORDER="0">45 years participating in the Multiethnic Cohort Study. The study population included 428 incident breast cancer cases and 426 controls. The prevalence of variants ranged from 0% to 13.6% among controls and varied by ethnicity (0-32.5%). Overall, these data provide little support for an association of ATM missense mutations with breast cancer among older women. We observed only one sequence variation (L546V), common among  African-American women, to be overrepresented among all high-stage breast cancer  cases (odds ratio, 3.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-8.84). After correction for multiple comparisons, this observed risk modification did not attain statistical significance. The distribution of ATM missense mutations and polymorphisms varied widely across the four ethnic groups studied. Although a single missense variant (L546V) appeared to act as a modest predictor of risk, the remaining variants were no more common in breast cancer cases as compared with controls.
12872252	Mutational analysis of the BRCA1-interacting genes ZNF350/ZBRK1 and BRIP1/BACH1 among BRCA1 and BRCA2-negative probands from breast-ovarian cancer families and among early-onset breast cancer cases and reference individuals.	Two potential breast cancer susceptibility genes, encoding the BRCA1-interacting  proteins ZNF350 (or ZBRK1) and BRIP1 (or BACH1), have been identified in yeast two-hybrid screens. We sequenced these genes in probands from 21 families with potentially inherited breast/ovarian cancer, all of which were negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Families had at least one case of male breast cancer, two  cases of ovarian cancer, or three or more cases of breast and ovarian cancer. In  addition, 58 early-onset (before age 35) breast cancer cases and 30 reference individuals were analyzed. Of 17 variants detected in ZBRK1, a missense mutation  Val524Ile was identified in the proband of one high-risk family, but no other family members were available for testing. Of 25 variants identified in BRIP1, in addition to four common silent or missense mutations, we identified Gln540Leu, a  non-conservative amino acid change, in a single familial proband with inflammatory breast cancer, but this mutation was not present in her three relatives with breast cancer. Haplotype analysis suggests that all ZBRK1 SNPs fall within a single block with two SNPs capturing 92% of the haplotype diversity, while the BRIP1 SNPs fall in two blocks, with five SNPs capturing 89%  of the haplotype diversity. Based on sequencing of ZBRK1 and BRIP1 in 21 BRCA1/2-negative probands from inherited breast/ovarian cancer families, it appears unlikely that mutations in these genes account for a significant fraction of inherited breast cancer. Further analysis in unselected cases will be required to know whether the identified variants play a role in genetic predisposition to  breast cancer in the general population.

12856637	Elevated serum triiodothyronine (t3) in Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients carrying the I1307k allele of the APC (adenopolyposis coli) gene.	PURPOSE: The risk of developing any cancer in carriers of the I1307K mutation of  the adenopolyposis coli (APC) gene is significantly increased (odds ratio 1.5, P  = 0.01). One of the cancers associated with the I1307K mutation is prostate cancer (odds ratio 2.0, P = 0.14). Also, there is an association of APC mutations with thyroid cancer. In this study, we measured triiodothyronine (t3) levels in Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients, with and without the I1307K mutation of the APC gene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants in our study were found through urology and radiation oncology clinics in 1999 and 2000. All eligible patients were asked to  take part. All patients had been initially diagnosed on the basis of rising PSA or abnormal physical examination. Histological confirmation of diagnosis was obtained for all subjects. Ethnic background was confirmed for all subjects by self-report or interview. The I1307K allele of the APC gene was detected by amplification of DNA isolated from peripheral blood according to standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and dot blot procedures. Serum t3 level was determined by fluorescent immunoassay with a standard, commercially available instrument. RESULTS: We studied 77 patients. The youngest patient was 46, the oldest 88, average age 67 +/- 7.2 (mean +/- SD). Eleven males carrying the APCI 1307K allele had significantly higher serum t3 levels than 66 males carrying the wild type allele. There were no homozygotes for the I1307K allele. None of the males had a  t3 level that was above the normal range for our laboratory (137 ng/dl). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of increased serum t3 level with the APC I1307K allele  in prostate cancer patients is not surprising, given the mitogenic potential of t3. Further studies may clarify whether t3 elevation is the mechanism whereby APC gene mutations increase the risk of prostate cancer, or whether other pathophysiologic abnormalities are involved.
12810666	Contributions of ATM mutations to familial breast and ovarian cancer.	This study addresses the prevalence of ATM mutations and the association with breast cancer in Austrian families selected for a history of breast or ovarian cancer or both [hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC)]. In 270 HBOC families previously screened for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, 137 different sequence alterations of ATM were identified. Seven of these were mutations presumed to cause ataxia telangiectasia based on their effect on the ATM protein, including five that caused a protein truncation and two missense mutations in the catalytic kinase domain of the highly conserved COOH terminus of the protein. The seven mutations were found in 10 families (3.7%). In addition, one missense variant, L1420F, was observed in 13 HBOC families (4.8%) but was not observed in  any of the 122 healthy volunteers with no history of breast cancer. In addition,  the variant segregated with breast cancer in some of the families, suggesting that it may be pathogenic for breast cancer. Sixty-two additional variants of potential significance were observed in 65 HBOC families, but not in healthy controls. These variants included 24 sequence alterations with possible effects on splicing or protein-protein interactions. This study indicates that there is a significant prevalence of ATM mutations in breast and ovarian cancer families and adds to a growing body of evidence that ATM mutations confer increased susceptibility to breast cancer.
12786840	Cowden's disease: clinical and molecular genetic findings in a patient with a novel PTEN germline mutation.	We report a 54-year-old woman with Cowden's disease (CD) who was found to carry a novel germline mutation in the PTEN gene. The mutation (c.334C-->G) introduced a  splice donor site within exon 5 that caused the expression of an aberrant transcript lacking 159 nucleotides corresponding to codons 112-164. Clinically, the patient showed multiple benign hamartomatous lesions of the skin, papillomatosis of the lips and oral mucosa, polyposis coli and bilateral fibrocystic disease of the breast. In addition, she developed different types of  malignant neoplasms, including bilateral carcinomas of the breast and malignant melanomas of the skin. Molecular genetic analysis of a benign skin hamartoma and  an invasive ductal breast carcinoma revealed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at microsatellite markers on chromosome 10 in the carcinoma but not in the hamartoma. The breast carcinoma additionally carried a somatic TP53 point mutation (c.466C-->G; R156G) that was associated with LOH on 17p and nuclear p53  protein accumulation. Taken together, our findings indicate that benign hamartomas in CD may develop without loss of the second (wild-type) PTEN allele,  whereas the pathogenesis of malignant tumours, such as breast carcinomas, appears to require the complete inactivation of Pten as well as further alterations such  as the loss of p53-dependent growth control.
12783936	New paraoxonase 1 polymorphism I102V and the risk of prostate cancer in Finnish men.	BACKGROUND: Human serum paraoxonase eliminates carcinogenic lipid-soluble radicals. Because expression of the main human paraoxonase gene PON1 varies widely in humans, certain PON1 polymorphisms might be associated with increased risks of cancer. We sought new functional mutations in PON1 and determined whether known or new PON1 mutations were associated with the risk for prostate cancer in a prospective, random, population-based sample of Finnish men and in a  case-control study. METHODS: Serum paraoxonase activity was measured in 835 healthy men in the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. PON1 mutations were identified by hierarchical phenotype-targeted sequencing in DNAs from the 100 men with the lowest paraoxonase activity in this cohort, and 1595 men in the cohort were genotyped for PON1 mutations by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Multivariable analysis was used to investigate the association of known and new PON1 mutations with incident prostate cancer in 1569 cancer-free men in the cohort followed for 9-14 years. In a case-control study of Finnish men, the association of prostate cancer with the PON1 mutation identified in the cohort study was investigated in 69 case patients with familial prostate cancer and 69 unmatched healthy control subjects. RESULTS: We identified a new single-nucleotide PON1 polymorphism associated with  decreased serum paraoxonase activity that caused an isoleucine-->valine change at codon 102 in exon 4 (I102V). Of the 1569 men cancer-free at baseline, 56 (3.6%) were carriers of the I102V mutation. After adjusting for age and cholesterol-lowering medications, the relative risk for developing prostate cancer during follow-up was 6.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1 to 19.2) among 102V allele carriers compared with noncarriers. Other PON1 alleles were not statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer. In the case-control  study, patients with familial prostate cancer were more likely to be carriers of  the PON1 I102V mutation than control subjects (odds ratio = 4.3, 95% CI = 0.9 to  21.5). CONCLUSION: The PON1 102V allele appears to be associated with an increased risk  for prostate cancer.
12702523	Prognostic value of p53 molecular status in high-risk primary breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Mutations in the p53 gene are the most common genetic alterations in  human primary breast carcinoma and these mutations are often associated with worse prognosis and chemo/radioresistance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis of the p53 gene was performed by fluorescence-assisted mismatch analysis in 13 consecutive high-risk primary breast cancer (HR-BC) patients with 10 or more involved axillary nodes to evaluate its prognostic value. RESULTS: Three p53 mutations (23%) and four allelic variants were detected. After a median follow-up of 52 months the HR-BC disease-free survival (DFS) was 51% and overall survival 79%. All patients harboring a p53 mutation (p53(mut)) relapsed within 10 months of the median DFS while 67% of those showing a wild-type p53 status (p53(wt)) survive disease-free at a median follow-up of 43 months. One p53(mut) patient is still alive while all the p53(wt) patients survive at 56 months median follow-up. Two out of the four p53(wt) relapsing breast cancer patients showed the Arg72Pro allelic variant; one of these died at 75 months. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations may help identify a subset of very high risk breast cancer patients (vHR-BC) with worse prognosis.
12668615	A naturally occurring mutation in an ATP-binding domain of the recombination repair gene XRCC3 ablates its function without causing cancer susceptibility.	Inherited mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, whose protein products are necessary for the homology-directed DNA repair pathway, confer a dominant susceptibility to cancer. We have investigated whether mutations of genes encoding other components of the same DNA repair pathway can also affect cancer susceptibility. We have identified three novel non-synonymous substitutions in one such gene, encoding the RAD51-related protein XRCC3. One of these variants, D213N, occurs in a highly conserved ATP-binding domain and completely abrogates the ability of the transfected gene to correct the phenotype of XRCC3 deficient cells. The D213N variant was found in the heterozygous state in DNA from 3/1577 healthy individuals. However, we did not detect this variant at all amongst 187 breast cancer families and 1300 unrelated patients with common cancers. Thus we have no evidence that D213N increases the risk of cancer. We propose that not all components of the homologous recombination repair complex can act as cancer susceptibility genes.
12649339	Characterization of a novel breast carcinoma xenograft and cell line derived from a BRCA1 germ-line mutation carrier.	A human tumor xenograft (L56Br-X1) was established from a breast cancer axillary  lymph node metastasis of a 53-year-old woman with a BRCA1 germ-line nonsense mutation (1806C>T; Q563X), and a cell line (L56Br-C1) was subsequently derived from the xenograft. The xenograft carries only the mutant BRCA1 allele and expresses mutant BRCA1 mRNA but no BRCA1 protein as determined by immunoprecipitation or Western blotting. The primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, and xenograft were hypodiploid by DNA flow cytometry, whereas the cell line displayed an aneuploidy apparently developed via polyploidization. Cytogenetic analysis, spectral karyotyping, and comparative genomic hybridization of the cell line revealed a highly complex karyotype with numerous unbalanced translocations. The xenograft and cell line had retained a somatic TP53 missense  mutation (S215I) originating from the primary tumors, as well as a lack of immunohistochemically detectable expression of steroid hormone receptors, epidermal growth factor receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and keratin 8. Global gene expression analysis by cDNA microarrays supported a correlation between the expression profiles of the primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, xenograft, and cell line. We conclude that L56Br-X1 and L56Br-C1 are useful model systems for studies of the pathogenesis and new therapeutic modalities of BRCA1-induced human breast cancer.
12645254	[Studies of mutations in BRCA1 transactivation domain by visualization of chromatin structure].	Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1(BRCA1) account for approximately 40%-50% of familial breast cancer cases and for more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancer cases. Many cancer-predisposing mutations are located in the C-terminal region that functions as a transcriptional activation domain, but most of the mutations in the transactivation domain identified to date cannot be readily distinguished as either disease-associated mutations or benign polymorphisms. Because chromatin structure regulation is an early event in gene transcription control, the chromatin unfolding activities of different transactivation domain variants were compared with that of the wild-type transactivation domain by use of an approach that allows visualization of large-scale chromatin structure through lac repressor/lac operator recognition. To do this, different constructs of the transactivation domain were selected as follows: (a) the wild-type transactivation domain; (b) two polymorphisms (S1613G  and M1652I); and (c) four cancer-predisposing mutations (A1708E, M1775R, W1837R and Y1853 term). All of the constructs were made by fusing in frame with lac repressor. Western blot analysis indicated that all of the fusion proteins were expressed in A03 1 cells, in which multiple copies of the lac operator were integrated to produce a heterochromatic region of the genome. The chromatin unfolding assay showed that, like the wild-type transactivation domain, two variants that represent benign polymorphisms did not induce chromatin unfolding or only induced subtle change. Contrary to the behaviors of the wild type and two benign variants, four cancer-predisposing mutations in the transactivation domain superactivate the chromatin unfolding. The results suggest that the chromatin unfolding assay can aid in the characterization of deterious mutations in the C-terminal transactivation domain of BRCA1 and may provide more reliable presymptomatic risk assessment.
12628588	Detection of base sequence changes in the CEBPD gene in human breast cancer cell  lines and primary breast cancer isolates.	Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed on genomic  DNA from 97 human breast cancer samples and 10 breast cell lines to screen for mutations in the single exon C/EBPD gene. Three C --> T transitions resulting in  silent mutations were detected in three individual breast cancer samples. One breast cancer sample also contained a G --> T transversion (Q253H). The SUM-52PE  cell line contained an A --> T transversion (AAG --> TAG) resulting in a nonsense mutation (K180Stop). All mutations identified in genomic DNA isolates were in highly conserved regions of the C/EBPD gene. This study indicates that mutational alterations in the coding region of the C/EBPD gene are relatively uncommon in human breast cancer.
12602915	Androgen receptor gene alterations in Finnish male breast cancer.	Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene have been suggested to predispose to male breast cancer (MBC). Studies on MBC patients have not been based on the mutation screening of the entire coding region of the AR and the number of subjects has been small. Therefore, some AR gene alterations may have remained undetected. In the present study, we have comprehensively screened the entire coding region of the AR gene for mutations and also studied the role of AR CAG and GGC repeat lengths as risk factors for MBC in a cohort of 32 Finnish MBC patients. To estimate the possible involvement of the prostate cancer predisposing AR Arg726Leu germ-line mutation in MBC, this mutation was tested in  117 MBC patients. No germ-line mutations were found and the CAG and GGC repeat lengths were similar among MBC cases as among Scandinavian population. Our data indicate that the AR gene does not substantially contribute to MBC predisposition.
12516098	The patched polymorphism Pro1315Leu (C3944T) may modulate the association between use of oral contraceptives and breast cancer risk.	The gene coding for the human homologue of the Drosophila segment polarity gene patched (PTCH1) is mutated in several common human tumors. In mice, haplodeficiency at the Ptch1 locus results in severe histologic defects in mammary ductal structure. We found no mutations within the coding region of PTCH1 in 17 human primary breast carcinomas. However, the biallelic Pro1315Leu (C3944T) polymorphism of PTCH1 was significantly associated with breast cancer in 41 Bavarian patients compared to 85 healthy controls. We investigated whether this variant influences susceptibility for breast cancer in 611 breast cancer patients diagnosed by age 50 years and 1,057 controls matched by age and study region in Germany and in 1,093 breast cancer patients from the United Kingdom. Allele and genotype frequencies were not different between cases and controls. However, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed an effect modification of oral contraceptive use (OC) on breast cancer risk by Leu-carrier status. Compared to women who have Pro/Pro and never used OC, Pro/Pro OC users had an increased odds  ratio for breast cancer of 1.7. The odds ratio was also 1.7 for Leu-carriers who  never used OC, but this was attenuated among Leu-carriers who ever used OC by 20%. The gene-environmental interaction was confirmed in case-only analysis of the German and British studies, yielding an interaction odds ratio of 0.7 for premenopausal women (p = 0.06). Longer duration of pill use was associated with a significantly greater risk reduction (p for trend = 0.015). Our novel observation of a differential effect of OC use on breast cancer risk by PTCH1 1315Leu-carrier status suggests the interesting possibility of the Sonic hedgehog/Patched (SHH/PTCH1) signaling pathway being involved in hormone-induced development of breast carcinoma.
12100746	A49T, V89L and TA repeat polymorphisms of steroid 5alpha-reductase type II and breast cancer risk in Japanese women.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is hormone related, as are cancers of the endometrium,  ovary, and prostate. Several studies have suggested that higher extracellular levels of androgens are associated with breast cancer risk, while biological evidence indicates that androgens are protective. The codon 49 alanine to threonine substitution (A49T), codon 89 valine to leucine substitution (V89L) and TA repeat polymorphisms of the steroid 5alpha-reductase type II (SRD5A2) gene are considered functional with respect to enzyme activity converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone. To test the hypothesis that these three polymorphisms are associated with risk of breast cancer, a case-control study was conducted with patients of Aichi Cancer Center Hospital. METHODS: The cases were 237 patients histologically diagnosed with breast cancer, and the controls were 185 noncancer outpatients. DNA from peripheral blood was genotyped by PCR methods. RESULTS: The threonine allele of A49T was not found in our subjects. Compared with the V/V genotype of V89L, the L/L genotype was associated with a decreased risk (crude odds ratio [OR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.36-1.05). This was also the case for the TA(9/9) genotype, with an OR of 0.58 (95% CI = 0.13-2.63) relative to TA(0/0). Among women with the TA(0/0) genotype, however, the OR for the L/L genotype was 0.46 (95% CI = 0.24-0.88) compared with the V/V genotype, and those with the V/V and TA(0/0) genotypes had the highest risk. The  haplotype with the L and TA(9) repeat alleles was not found. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to our knowledge focusing on Japanese women,  suggesting that SRD5A2 polymorphisms might have an association with breast cancer risk. Further large-sample studies will be required to confirm the association and to assess any interactions with environmental factors.
12023985	A potential role for the XRCC2 R188H polymorphic site in DNA-damage repair and breast cancer.	An acquired genetic instability, resulting from the loss of some types of DNA repair, is an early event in the development of a subset of human cancers. The involvement of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) of double-strand breaks in DNA implicates this pathway in the suppression of breast  cancer. A family of proteins related to human RAD51, including XRCC2, are essential components of this repair pathway. Using site-directed mutagenesis of XRCC2, we show that non-conservative substitution or deletion of amino acid 188 of XRCC2 can significantly affect cellular sensitivity to DNA damage, and that a  polymorphic variant at this site (R188H ), present on 6% of chromosomes in the population, has a weak effect on damage sensitivity. We tested the hypothesis that the R188H polymorphism could be a low-penetrance susceptibility factor for breast cancer, by genotyping 521 women with breast cancer and a total of 895 control women. Carriage of the rare allele of XRCC2 R188H was associated with breast cancer overall [odds ratio 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=(1.0, 1.8)] and when younger-onset cases with a positive family history were compared with older controls with no family history [odds ratio 1.9; 95% CI=(1.0, 3.8)]. These  results support the hypothesis that subtle variation in DNA repair capacity may influence cancer susceptibility in the population.
11894125	Molecular cloning and expression of proto-oncogene FRAT1 in human cancer.	FRAT1 and FRAT2 genes, clustered in human chromosome 10q24, are human homologues  to mouse proto-oncogene Frat1, which promotes carcinogenesis through activation of the WNT - beta-catenin - TCF signaling pathway. FRAT1 and FRAT2 mRNAs are up-regulated together in a gastric cancer cell line TMK1, and also in 2 out of 10 cases of primary gastric cancer. Here, we isolated FRAT1 cDNA (AB074890), which showed two amino-acid substitutions (Gln57X and His58Asp) compared with human FRAT1 cDNA previously reported by another group (U58975). The Gln57-His58 FRAT1 allele isolated in this study was also identified in human genome draft sequences. FRAT1 mRNA was almost ubiquitously expressed in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Expression level of FRAT1 mRNA was relatively higher in esophageal cancer cell lines TE2, TE3, TE4, a cervical cancer cell line SKG-IIIa, and breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T-47D. Expression level of FRAT1 mRNA was  not significantly changed after all-trans retinoic-acid treatment in NT2 cells with the potential of neuronal differentiation. Expression of FRAT1 mRNA in MCF-7 cells derived from breast cancer was down-regulated by beta-estradiol. This is the first report on isolation of FRAT1 cDNA derived from the more common FRAT1 allele, and also on regulation of FRAT1 mRNA in human cancer cells.
11742035	Androgen receptor alterations in prostate cancer relapsed during a combined androgen blockade by orchiectomy and bicalutamide.	Mechanisms of prostate cancer (CaP) recurrence during a combined androgen blockade (CAB) are poorly understood. Previously, the role of androgen receptor (AR) gene mutations underlying the CAB therapy relapse has been raised. To investigate the hypothesis that AR gene aberrations are involved in CAB relapse,  11 locally recurrent CaP samples from patients treated with orchiectomy and bicalutamide were analyzed for copy number changes and DNA sequence alterations of the AR gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization and single-strand conformation polymorphism, respectively. Altogether, base changes were detected in four tumors (36%). Three of them were missense mutations (G166S, W741C, M749I) and two were silent polymorphisms. Interestingly, none of the tumors had AR amplification. These data suggest that different AR variants are developed and selected for during various types of hormonal treatments, and also, that CAB achieved by orchiectomy and bicalutamide does not act as a selective force for AR amplification.
11705864	Association of E-cadherin germ-line alterations with prostate cancer.	In our recent cancer registry-based study, the incidence of gastric carcinoma was increased up to 5-fold in male relatives of early-onset prostate cancer (PCA) patients. This association may reflect the influence of genetic factors predisposing individuals to both tumor types. Germ-line mutations of the CDH1 gene at 16q have recently been associated with familial gastric cancer. Furthermore, two genome-wide linkage studies of PCA recently reported positivity  at 16q. We therefore identified families and individual patients with both gastric and PCA and investigated whether the CDH1 gene mutations were involved in cancer predisposition in these cases. Fifteen of the 180 Finnish hereditary PCA families (8.3%) had one or more gastric cancer cases. No truncating or splice site CDH1 mutations were identified by PCR single-strand conformational polymorphism in these families or in eight individual patients who had both prostate and gastric cancer. However, a novel S270A missense mutation in exon 6 of the CDH1 gene was seen in a single family with four prostate and two gastric cancers. A large-scale population-based survey indicated a higher prevalence of S270A among both familial PCA cases (3.3%; n = 120; P = 0.01) and unselected PCA  patients (1.5%; n = 472; P = 0.12) as compared with blood donors serving as population controls (0.5%; n = 923). We conclude that individual rare mutations and polymorphisms in the CDH1 gene, such as S270A, may contribute to the onset of PCA and warrant further investigations in other populations. However, the CDH1 gene does not appear to explain the link between prostate and gastric cancer.
11434510	Relationship between glutathione S-transferase M1, P1 and T1 polymorphisms and early onset prostate cancer.	There is evidence suggesting that polymorphic variations in the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are associated with cancer susceptibility. Inter-individual differences in cancer susceptibility may be mediated in part through polymorphic  variability in the bioactivation and detoxification of carcinogens. The GSTs have been consistently implicated as cancer susceptibility genes in this context. The  GST supergene family includes several loci with well characterized polymorphisms. Approximately 50% of the Caucasian population are homozygous for deletions in GSTM1 and approximately 20% are homozygous for deletions in GSTT1, resulting in conjugation deficiency of mutagenic electrophiles to glutathione. The GSTP1 gene  has a polymorphism at codon 105 resulting in an Ile to Val substitution which consequently alters the enzymatic activity of the protein and this has been suggested as a putative high-risk genotype in various cancers. We investigated the relationship between GST polymorphisms and young onset prostate cancer in a case-control study. GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 genotypes were determined for 275 prostate cancer patients and for 280 geographically matched control subjects. We  found no significant difference in the frequency of GSTM1 or GSTT1 null genotypes between cases and controls. GSTP1 genotype was, however, significantly associated with prostate cancer risk: the Ile/Ile homozygotes had the lowest risk and there  was a trend in increasing the risk with the number of 105 Val alleles: Ile/Val odds ratio (OR)= 1.30 (95% FCI 0.99-1.69), Val/Val OR = 1.80 (95% FCI 1.11-2.91); Ptrend = 0.026. These results suggest that the GSTP1 polymorphism may be a risk factor for developing young onset prostate cancer. We also found that carrying more than one putative high-risk allele in the carcinogen metabolizing GST family was associated with an elevated risk for early onset prostate cancer (OR 2.48, 95% FCI 1.22-5.04, Ptrend = 0.017).
11369138	Contribution of germline MLH1 and MSH2 mutations to lobular carcinoma in situ of  the breast.	Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is an unusual histological pattern of non-invasive neoplastic disease of the breast occurring predominantly in women aged between 40 and 50 years. LCIS is frequently multicentric and bilateral suggesting a genetic basis to the disease. The high frequency of microsatellite instability in lobular breast cancers, coupled with increased risk of breast cancer associated with germline mismatch repair gene mutations raises the possibility that mutations MSH2 or MLH1 might confer susceptibility to LCIS. To explore this possibility we have examined a series of 71 LCIS patients for germline MSH2 and MLH1 mutations. No mutations were detected in MSH2. Two sequence variants were identified in MLH1. The first was a CTT-->CAT substitution, codon 607 (exon 16) changing leucine to histidine. The other mutation detected in MLH1 was a TAC-->TAA substitution codon 750 (exon 19) creating a stop codon, predicted to generate a truncated protein. These findings  suggest that mutations in MLH1 may underlie a subset of LCIS cases.
11212236	Inhibiting mutations in the transforming growth factor beta type 2 receptor in recurrent human breast cancer.	Members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family are potent inhibitors of the growth of many epithelial cell types. Transmembrane signaling by TGF-beta occurs via a complex of the serine/threonine kinases TGF-beta type 1  receptor and TGF-beta type 2 receptor (TGFBR2), and inactivating mutations in the latter have recently been detected in some primary tumors and in several types of tumor-derived cell lines. The most common mutations that have been identified in  TGFBR2 are frameshifts in a repetitive polyadenine region in replication error-positive colorectal carcinomas that result in a truncated protein and absence of receptor expression at the cell surface. A number of point mutations in the highly conserved serine/threonine kinase domain of TGFBR2 have also been reported, some of which have been correlated with either loss of trans-phosphorylation of TGF-beta type 1 receptor or constitutive activation of trans-phosphorylation. No TGFBR2 mutations have been reported in human breast tumors, but anomalous expression of TGF-beta in breast carcinomas suggests that TGF-beta signaling may be defective. We have therefore systematically examined unmatched sets of 17 primary and 17 recurrent breast tumor samples for mutations  in TGFBR2, restricted to those regions of the gene in which mutations have previously been reported. None of the previously reported mutations was detected, but four novel mutations (V387M, N435S, V447A, and L452M) were found in the kinase domain in recurrent tumors. No mutations were detected in primary tumors.  TGF-beta signaling was significantly inhibited by each of the N435S, V447A, and L452M mutations.
10901165	Identification of p53 gene mutations in breast cancers and their effects on transcriptional activation function.	Somatic mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common genetic alterations found in human malignancies. In the present study, we studied 36 primary human breast carcinomas, using a polymerase chain reaction-single-strand  conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing analysis of exons 2 through 9 for the presence of p53 gene mutations. Six of 36 (17%) breast cancers contained  mutations within the core domain of the p53 protein responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding (codons 102-292); all 5 missense mutations clustered between codons 240 and 291 (codons 240, 243, 250, 285, and 291), whereas one nonsense mutation occurred at codon 199. By using recombinant PCR in  vitro mutagenesis, we introduced point mutations at codons 199 from Gly to stop (gly199stop), 240 from Ser to Ile (ser240Ile), 250 from Pro to Ala (pro250ala), 285 from Glu to Lys (glu285lys), and 291 from Lys to Asn (lys291asn), and all the p53 sequences were subcloned into the CMVneoBam vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. To test whether the mutants p53 were functionally wild-type (wt) or mutant, we transfected them to p53-null Saos-2 cells with a reporter plasmid containing a p53-responsive element, and performed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay. Transient CAT assay for transcriptional activation revealed that one group, including gly199stop, ser240ile, glu285lys, and lys291asn, abolished the transcriptional activity, whereas the other group, including pro250ala, retained stronger transcriptional transactivation activity than that of wt p53.
10698474	Genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450-1B1 and risk of breast cancer.	Cytochrome P450-1B1 (CYP1B1) is a major enzyme catalyzing the formation of genotoxic 4-hydroxyestradiol. This enzyme is also involved in the activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic amines, mammary carcinogens in experimental animals. CYP1B1 is genetically polymorphic, and the variations in the CYP1B1 gene may be related to the risk of breast cancer. We evaluated this hypothesis among 186 breast cancer cases and 200 age-matched controls as part of a large population-based case-control study conducted in urban Shanghai during 1996 to 1998. Genomic DNA from cases and controls was analyzed for genetic polymorphism in codon 432 (Val-->Leu) of the CYP1B1 gene using a PCR-RFLP-based assay. The frequency of the Leu allele was 53% in cases and 46% in controls (P = 0.06). Compared with those with the Val/Val genotype, women with the Leu/Leu genotype had a 2.3-fold [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-4.5] elevated risk of breast cancer after adjusting for potential confounding variables. This positive association was more pronounced among postmenopausal women (Odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.0-9.1) than premenopausal women (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.8-4.3). Elevated risks of breast cancer associated with homozygosity for the Leu allele were observed in virtually all subgroups of women defined by major risk factors for breast cancer. The results from this study were consistent with  recent findings from in vitro and animal experiments implicating a potentially important role of CYP1B1 in the etiology of human breast cancer.
10547570	Altered expression of p53 and its regulated proteins in phyllodes tumours of the  breast.	The histological characteristics of phyllodes tumours of the breast are often not related to their clinical outcome. Additional studies must therefore be performed to investigate the possible relationship of cell biological parameters to the biological behaviour of these tumours. The expression of Ki-67, p53, and its regulated proteins has been studied in 19 primary phyllodes tumours, from patients with known follow-up, using immunohistochemical and molecular biological techniques. Overexpression of the p53 protein was observed in four cases and mutation in two cases. In only one case, the sequence alteration, at codon 273, was associated with overexpression of p53 protein and with strong expression of Ki-67 (30 per cent). This alteration was found in the primary, the recurrent, and the metastatic tumour samples. Moreover, the same p53 gene mutation, Arg273Cys, was detected in all tumour samples. No mutation was found in adjacent normal breast tissue, indicating that this was an acquired mutation. Unexpectedly, strong BAX expression was observed in the primary tumour. The patient died during the follow-up period. It is concluded that p53 gene status and an accumulation of BAX, both involved in the same apoptosis-controlling pathway, may be of prognostic relevance in phyllodes tumours.
10534763	Identification of germline missense mutations and rare allelic variants in the ATM gene in early-onset breast cancer.	Epidemiological studies have shown an increased risk of breast cancer in obligate ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) heterozygotes. We analyzed 100 samples from young breast cancer patients for mutations in ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), the  gene responsible for the autosomal recessive condition, A-T, to determine whether A-T heterozygosity predisposes such individuals to develop breast cancer. These patients were selected from families with a moderate or absent family history of  breast cancer and included a subset of 16 radiosensitive patients. Forty-four germline sequence variants were detected by fluorescent chemical cleavage of mismatch of RT-PCR products. These included seven rare variants found in nine patients (three described for the first time), but no truncating mutations. Although three variants were detected in the radiosensitive subset, this was not  statistically significant compared to the nonradiosensitive group. One variant, G2765S, is likely to be a missense mutation, but the other six variants probably  represent rare polymorphisms. However, five of the seven rare germline variants detected showed loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type ATM allele for one or more markers close to the ATM locus in matched tumor DNA. This high rate of somatic inactivation of ATM may indicate either that these rare variants play a role in breast cancer development or alternatively that a neighboring tumor suppressor gene is important for tumorigenesis. We found germline truncating ATM  mutations to be rare in these young breast cancer patients and therefore they are unlikely to play a role in the etiology of their disease.

10485478	Altered ligand binding by insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate receptors bearing missense mutations in human cancers.	The M6P/IGF2R gene, encoding the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II)/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF2R), is frequently inactivated during carcinogenesis. M6P/IGF2R is postulated to be a tumor suppressor gene due to its ability to bind  and degrade the mitogen IGF-II, promote activation of the growth inhibitor transforming growth factor beta, and regulate the targeting of lysosomal enzymes. In this study, we determined the effects of four M6P/IGF2R missense mutations associated with loss of heterozygosity in hepatocellular and breast cancers on the ligand binding properties of full-length membrane-bound receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to prepare COOH-terminal, c-myc epitope-tagged human IGF2R cDNA expression constructs bearing point mutations that lead to the substitutions I1572T, G1464E, G1449V, and Q1445H, all of which are located in the receptor's extracytoplasmic domain. Ligand binding was measured in plasma membranes from 293T cells expressing full-length receptors. No binding of 125I-IGF-II to I1572T mutant receptors was observed. Binding to G1449V mutant receptors was decreased by 50% relative to wild-type (WT). However, IGF-II binding to the G1464E and Q1445H mutant receptors was equivalent to WT when plasma membranes were assayed immediately after preparation. The phosphomannosylated pseudoglycoprotein pentamannose 6-phosphate-BSA (PMP-BSA) was synthesized as a ligand for the M6P binding site. Binding of 125I-PMP-BSA was equivalent to WT for the I1572T, G1464E, and Q1445H mutations, but there was a 60% reduction in PMP-BSA binding to the G1449V mutant receptor. Thus, several missense mutations in M6P/IGF2R disrupt the ligand binding functions of the intact IGF2R, lending further support to the hypothesis that the M6P/IGF2R is a tumor suppressor gene.
10477429	TP53 mutation and haplotype analysis of two large African American families.	Two large apparently unrelated African American families with a high incidence of breast cancer and other tumors characteristic of Li-Fraumeni breast sarcoma cancer family syndrome were studied. Mutation screening revealed that in both families the affected members carried a germline mutation of the TP53 gene at codon 133 (ATG--> ACG, M133T). In order to determine whether an ancestral haplotype was shared by these two families, polymorphic markers within and flanking the TP53 gene were studied. Haplotype analysis using five markers revealed an identical haplotype shared by the two families. Loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus in the probands' tumor tissues from each family  was observed; in each case, the retained allele carried the common haplotype. The frequency of this haplotype in the general African American population is <0.003. This unique haplotype, combined with the rare TP53 mutation, suggests that these  African American families share a common ancestry. This finding suggests that other African Americans may be carriers of this mutation and thus may be at risk  of early-onset breast cancer or other cancers characteristic of the Li-Fraumeni breast sarcoma cancer family syndrome. The finding of recurring mutations in African Americans may facilitate carrier screening and identification in this population.
9874460	Very frequent p53 mutations in metastatic prostate carcinoma and in matched primary tumors.	BACKGROUND: The frequency of mutant p53 in bone marrow metastases of patients with carcinoma of the prostate (CaP) and in matched sets of metastatic and primary lesions from the same patients was investigated. The data were examined in relation to prior treatment with androgen ablation (AA) therapy and were compared with the frequency of mutant p53 reported for primary CaP. METHODS: Seventeen patients with M1b (bone metastasis: TNM Stage IV) CaP had either unilateral or bilateral bone marrow biopsies taken for these studies. Specimens were divided and the outer one-third examined histologically to confirm the presence of CaP cells. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for accumulated p53 protein was performed by an antibody cocktail technique. RNA was extracted from the remaining portion of the biopsy, and p53 transcripts were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and screened for base sequence changes in the exon 4-11 region using nonisotopic single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Ten of 17 metastases (59%) demonstrated accumulation of p53. Six of 7 (86%) of the p53 IHC positive bone marrow samples contained RT-PCR-SSCP abnormalities, as did 2 of 3 IHC negative samples. Overall, 12 of 17 metastases (71%) contained mutant p53. Four of 7 biopsies (57%) retrieved prior to AA contained mutant p53, whereas 8 of 10 post-AA biopsies (80%) contained mutant p53. One patient showed identical SSCP abnormalities in right and left iliac crest metastases after therapy, and in this patient DNA sequencing demonstrated a missense mutation at codon 126 (TAC --> GGC, Tyr --> Gly). Archival primary cancers from seven patients were retrieved. All seven were IHC positive for p53 accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations are associated with increased metastatic potential of  CaP. Abnormalities are found at approximately twice the frequency in metastases than in unselected samples of primary CaP, whereas in matched specimens there is  a high rate of consonance. Mutant p53 may contribute to systemic therapy resistance, due to increased association with post-AA CaP specimens.
9825943	Astrocytomas and choroid plexus tumors in two families with identical p53 germline mutations.	Germline p53 mutations carry an increased risk of development of breast cancer, soft tissue and osteosarcomas, brain tumors, leukemia and adrenocortical carcinomas. Cerebral neoplasms are usually of astrocytic lineage and occur in 40% of affected families. This report presents clinical, neuropathological and molecular genetic data from 2 families in France with an identical p53 germline mutation in codon 248 (CGG->TGG; Arg->Trp) and a clustering of CNS tumors. The youngest patient in each family developed a malignant choroid plexus tumor while  several young adults of both kindred succumbed to low-grade astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma. The only non-neural neoplasm was an adrenocortical carcinoma in a boy aged 4 years who developed an anaplastic choroid plexus papilloma 2 years later. Of 2 previously reported inherited choroid plexus tumors, 1 occurred in a family which also carried a germline mutation in codon 248. It remains to be shown whether this unusual pattern of CNS tumors is due to an organ-specific effect of this particular p53 mutation or whether it reflects the genetic background of the affected families.
9806478	Screening for tumour suppressor p16(CDKN2A) germline mutations in Israeli melanoma families.	Approximately ten percent of patients with malignant melanoma have family histories of the disease, suggesting a genetic predisposition. Germline mutations in tumour suppressor p16 gene have been implicated as disease causing mutations in some of the melanoma families. The frequency of families with p16 germline mutations among melanoma prone families varies from eight to fifty percent. The range of the variability is influenced apparently by the number of melanoma affected individuals within the family, as well as by other, yet unidentified factors. Ethnic background is known to determine both the frequency and the nature of germline alterations. Recently, specific mutations in tumour suppressor genes involved in breast cancer and in colon cancer were found at elevated frequency among Ashkenazi Jews. This report describes results of a screening for  p16 germline alterations in a collection of Israeli melanoma families. We have analyzed genomic DNA from thirty one Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jewish melanoma  families, as well as from thirty melanoma patients without an apparent family history of the disease. The entire coding region of the p16 gene was screened by  single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing. We have detected a number of carriers with the Ala148 Thr polymorphism at the end of the second exon and several instances of 500(G=>C) substitution at the 3' untranslated portion of the gene.
9635571	Beta-catenin mutations in human prostate cancer.	Beta-catenin plays essential roles in both intercellular adhesion and signal transduction. As a signaling molecule, beta-catenin supplies an activating domain to the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor family of DNA-binding proteins and activates gene transcription. Posttranslational stabilization of beta-catenin, leading to elevated protein levels and constitutive gene activation, has been proposed as an important step in oncogenesis. Stabilization  of beta-catenin can occur through mutation to highly conserved amino acids encoded in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1). To determine whether this pathway of malignant transformation is important in prostate cancer, we analyzed  104 prostate cancer tissue specimens, 4 prostate cancer cell lines, and 3 prostate tumor xenografts for activating mutations in exon 3 of CTNNB1. Mutations were detected in 5 of the 104 prostate cancer tissue samples. Four of the five mutations involved serine or threonine residues implicated in the degradation of  beta-catenin. A fifth tumor had a mutation at codon 32, changing a highly conserved aspartic acid to a tyrosine. Mutational analysis of multiple regions from several tumor samples showed that the beta-catenin mutations were present focally and therefore may occur during tumor progression.
9585599	Missense mutations in disease genes: a Bayesian approach to evaluate causality.	The problem of interpreting missense mutations of disease-causing genes is an increasingly important one. Because these point mutations result in alteration of only a single amino acid of the protein product, it is often unclear whether this change alone is sufficient to cause disease. We propose a Bayesian approach that  utilizes genetic information on affected relatives in families ascertained through known missense-mutation carriers. This method is useful in evaluating known disease genes for common disease phenotypes, such as breast cancer or colorectal cancer. The posterior probability that a missense mutation is disease  causing is conditioned on the relationship of the relatives to the proband, the population frequency of the mutation, and the phenocopy rate of the disease. The  approach is demonstrated in two cancer data sets: BRCA1 R841W and APC I1307K. In  both examples, this method helps establish that these mutations are likely to be  disease causing, with Bayes factors in favor of causality of 5.09 and 66.97, respectively, and posterior probabilities of .836 and .985. We also develop a simple approximation for rare alleles and consider the case of unknown penetrance and allele frequency.
9419972	Resistance of MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells to TNF-induced cell death is associated with loss of p53 function.	We have investigated the relationship between the development of tumor resistance towards the cytotoxic action of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and p53 function, using the TNF-sensitive MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell line and  two TNF-resistant sublines, MCF7/R-A1 and MCF7/Adr. Use of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing shows that MCF7 has  a wild-type p53 gene, whereas both TNF-resistant sublines exhibit mutant p53. This includes a point mutation R280K in MCF7/R-A1 cells, and a point mutation at  the splicing acceptor site on the upstream border of exon 5 resulting in a 21 pb  deletion in MCF7/Adr cells. These mutations result in loss of p53 capacity to transactivate FASAY (functional assay in yeast). In contrast to what is observed  for parental MCF7 cells, treatment of resistant sublines with TNF or gamma-irradiation fails neither to induce the expression of the p53-regulated gene products p21waf1/CIP1 and MDM2, nor to arrest the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Disruption of p53 wild-type function in MCF7 cells by transfection with human papillomavirus type-16 E6 gene, leads to abrogation of the cytotoxic, but not the cytostatic activity of TNF. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that wild-type p53 is involved in cytotoxic action of TNF, and point out that loss of p53 function contributes to resistance of tumor cell to TNF-induced killing.
9407971	Abrogation of wild-type p53-mediated transactivation is insufficient for mutant p53-induced immortalization of normal human mammary epithelial cells.	The p53 protein has become a subject of intense interest since the discovery that about 50% of human cancers carry p53 mutations. Mutations in the p53 gene are the most frequent genetic lesions in breast cancer, suggesting a critical role for p53 protein in normal mammary epithelial cell (MEC) growth control. We previously demonstrated that abrogation of the p53 function by a cancer-derived p53 mutant,  del239, was sufficient to induce immortalization of normal MECs. To further extend these findings and to examine the mechanism of mutant p53-induced immortalization of MECs, we tested the immortalizing ability of four selected p53 mutants (R175H, R248W, R249S, and R273H), which involve residues that cluster close to N239 in the three-dimensional structure and which are critical for the DNA-binding function of p53. Interestingly, two of these mutants (R175H and R249S) reproducibly immortalized 76N normal MECs, whereas the other two mutants (R248W and R273H) induced an extension of life span but not immortalization. These results further substantiate that selective ablation of p53 function with dominant-negative mutants is sufficient for immortalization of MECs. To determine whether abrogation of the transactivation function of endogenous p53 was important for the differential immortalizing ability of p53 mutants, we measured  the effects of mutant p53 on the endogenous wild-type p53-mediated transactivation of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter linked to a consensus p53 binding DNA sequence in transiently transfected 76N MECs. All of the mutants, regardless of their immortalizing phenotype, abrogated the endogenous wild-type p53-mediated transactivation to a similar extent. Thus, abrogation of transactivation function is not sufficient for mutant p53-induced immortalization of normal MECs. The p53-immortalized MECs showed substantial telomerase activity; however, induction of telomerase activity occurred at late passages and was undetectable in mutant p53-expressing cells prior to immortalization. We suggest that mechanisms other than abrogation of transactivation and induction of telomerase activity determine the differential MEC-immortalizing behavior of various p53 mutants.
9302181	Identification of two germline point mutations in the 5'UTR of the androgen receptor gene in men with prostate cancer.	PURPOSE: As part of an ongoing study to identify germline mutations and/or polymorphisms in the androgen receptor (AR) gene which might be associated with prostate cancer, the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of the AR gene was screened in genomic DNA of prostate cancer cases. This region, which is > 1 kb in length,  might modulate AR expression by affecting transcription and/or translation rates. A life-time exposure to enhanced AR expression, in turn, could potentially predispose to prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA samples from 38 prostate cancer cases were analyzed for mutations in the 5'UTR of the AR gene. RESULTS: Two mutations were identified. One mutation, G2T, is located within the  AR transcription initiation site 1 (AR-TIS I), and the second, C214A, within a GC rich region of the 5'UTR. CONCLUSIONS: Although 5'UTR mutations in the AR gene might only rarely occur in men with prostate cancer, the occasional mutation in this area may contribute to  the disease by altering rates of transcription and/or translation of this gene.
8710380	A novel p53 germline alteration identified in a late onset breast cancer kindred.	Germline mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are associated with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, characterized by childhood sarcoma, leukemia and early onset breast cancer and has occasionally been found also in familial breast-ovarian cancer. Most mutations found are of missense type and located in the central region of the gene (exons 5 to 8). In the present study, a germline p53 alteration was identified in a late onset breast cancer family (kindred Lund  5; mean age 58 years) using single stranded conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. The mutation (a CCG to CTG transition) at codon 82 in exon 4,  resulting in a proline to leucine substitution, has not previously been reported  and was not present in a control set of 60 healthy individuals. Three of five woman with breast cancer (45, 57 and 65 years) were carriers of the alteration. Loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus was not seen in the primary tumors of these women, but appeared as a partial loss of the wildtype allele in subsequent  recurrent lesions of two gene carriers. The family manifested no linkage to the p53 gene (a two-point LOD-score of -0.41), and has previously also been excluded  for linkage to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 loci, as well as being carrier of a BRCA1 germline mutation. Although it seems unlikely that the p53 germline mutation is the major cause of disease predisposition in Lund 5, the data suggest that some p53 alteration may confer a subtle influence on breast cancer development and progression.
9815913	p53 mutation and tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.	A substantial portion of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer fail to respond to estrogen depletion or to the antiestrogen tamoxifen. The molecular changes that lead to tamoxifen resistance and estrogen-independent growth are unknown. To test the hypothesis that a p53 mutation could result in tamoxifen resistance and estrogen-independent growth, the MCF-7 cell line was transfected with p53 cDNA which was mutated at codon 179 (histidine to glutamine). MCF-7 is an estrogen receptor-positive, estrogen-dependent, tamoxifen-sensitive cell line with only wild-type p53. The presence of transfected mutant p53 cDNA was verified by the PCR, and overexpression of p53 protein was assessed by Western blotting. Five separate mutant-transfected clones were selected and tested in subsequent growth experiments. In monolayer culture,  there was no consistent evidence of estrogen-independent growth or tamoxifen resistance in the mutant transfectants compared with vector-only controls or the  parental cell line. In soft agar growth experiments, four of five mutant transfectants remained sensitive to tamoxifen in a dose-dependent manner. In the  presence of wild-type p53, mutant 179 p53 protein does not result in estrogen-independent growth or tamoxifen resistance. These results do not exclude the possibility that other p53 mutational types could result in tamoxifen resistance, or that loss of the remaining wild-type allele may be necessary to result in this phenotype.
7798298	Aberrations of the APC gene in primary breast carcinoma.	Aberrations of the APC gene, which plays an important role in the genesis of familial adenomatous polyposis and colorectal carcinoma, were investigated in 31  surgical specimens of primary breast carcinoma. These studies utilized the polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction-fragment-length polymorphism and single-strand-conformation polymorphism analyses combined with tumor cell enrichment by cell sorting. Loss of heterozygosity at the APC locus was detected  in 8 (38%) of 21 informative cases, but only 2 (6%) of 31 tumors carried a mutated APC gene. Direct DNA sequencing analysis confirmed mutations at codon 1081 (AGC to ATC) resulting in an amino acid substitution of serine for isoleucine, and at codon 1096 (CAG to CAT) resulting in a substitution of glutamine for histidine. There were no significant correlations between the loss  of heterozygosity or mutation at the APC locus and any clinicopathological characteristics. Our present observations suggest that the mutations of the APC gene may play an important role in the genesis of certain breast carcinomas, and  that another tumor-suppressor gene, which is the true target of frequent loss of  heterozygosity, may exist near the APC gene.
