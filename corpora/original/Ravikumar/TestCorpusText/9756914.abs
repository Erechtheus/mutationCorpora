X-ray analysis of the NMC-A beta-lactamase at 1.64-A resolution, a class A carbapenemase with broad substrate specificity.
The treatment of infectious diseases by penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics  is continuously challenged by the emergence and the dissemination of the numerous TEM and SHV mutant beta-lactamases with extended substrate profiles. These class  A beta-lactamases nevertheless remain inefficient against carbapenems, the most effective antibiotics against clinically relevant pathogens. A new member of this enzyme class, NMC-A, was recently reported to hydrolyze at high rates, and hence  destroy, all known beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems and cephamycins. The crystal structure of NMC-A was solved to 1.64-A resolution, and  reveals modifications in the topology of the substrate-binding site. While preserving the geometry of the essential catalytic residues, the active site of the enzyme presents a disulfide bridge between residues 69 and 238, and certain other structural differences compared with the other beta-lactamases. These unusual features in class A beta-lactamases involve amino acids that participate  in enzyme-substrate interactions, which suggested that these structural factors should be related to the very broad substrate specificity of this enzyme. The comparison of the NMC-A structure with those of other class A enzymes and enzyme-ligand complexes, indicated that the position of Asn-132 in NMC-A provides critical additional space in the region of the protein where the poorer substrates for class A beta-lactamases, such as cephamycins and carbapenems, need to be accommodated.
