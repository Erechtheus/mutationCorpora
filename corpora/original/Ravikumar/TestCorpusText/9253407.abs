Crystal structure of a trapped phosphoenzyme during a catalytic reaction.
The crystal structure of the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase domain trapped during the reaction reveal a phosphorylated His 258, and a water molecule immobilized by the product, fructose-6-phosphate. The geometry suggests that the dephosphorylation step requires prior removal of the product for an 'associative  in-line' phosphoryl transfer to the catalytic water. CRDT- 1997/08/01 00:00
