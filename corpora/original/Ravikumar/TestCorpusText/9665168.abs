The structure of mammalian hexokinase-1.
We have determined the structures of the glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)-inhibitable 100,000 Mr Type I hexokinase from rat and the G6P-sensitive 50,000 Mr hexokinase  from Schistosoma mansoni at a resolution of 2.8 and 2.6 A respectively. The structures define the glucose and G6P binding sites in these enzymes, suggest the mechanisms of intradomain G6P inhibition and activity loss in the Type I hexokinase N-terminal half, and reveal the structure of the membrane targeting motif that integrates the Type I hexokinase into the outer mitochondrial membrane.
