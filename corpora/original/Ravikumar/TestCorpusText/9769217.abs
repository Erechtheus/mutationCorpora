Conformational differences of an immunosuppressant peptolide in a single crystal  and in a crystal complex with human cyclophilin A.
The crystal structure of (Thr2, Leu5, d-Hiv8, Leu10)-cyclosporin (cyclic peptolide SDZ 214-103) has been determined as the unbound crystal form and as a complex with human cyclophilin A. This pair of structures provides an example of  a significant difference in conformation between free and bound ligand in crystals. The conformation of the unbound form is unlike that of both free and bound conformations of cyclosporin A (with the amide bond between residues 3 and  4 in the cis conformation), while the bound conformation is similar to that of CsA bound to cyclophilin. The cyclophilin-bound conformations of both ligands are similar, though this involves a significantly different waterellipsisligand hydrogen-bonding structure, which compensates for the chemical differences between the two ligands.
