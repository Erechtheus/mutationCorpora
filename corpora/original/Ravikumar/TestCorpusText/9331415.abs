N-terminal arm exchange is observed in the 2.15 A crystal structure of oxidized nitrite reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
BACKGROUND: Nitrite reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NiR-Pa) is a dimer consisting of two identical 60 kDa subunits, each of which contains one c and one d1 heme group. This enzyme, a soluble component of the electron-transfer chain that uses nitrate as a source of energy, can be induced by the addition of nitrate to the bacterial growth medium. NiR-Pa catalyzes the reduction of nitrite (NO2-) to nitric oxide (NO); in vitro, both cytochrome c551 and azurin are efficient electron donors in this reaction. NiR is a key denitrification enzyme,  which controls the rate of the production of toxic nitric oxide (NO) and ultimately regulates the release of NO into the atmosphere. RESULTS: The structure of the orthorhombic form (P2(1)2(1)2) of oxidized NiR-Pa was solved at  2.15 A resolution, using molecular replacement with the coordinates of the NiR from Thiosphaera pantotropha (NiR-Tp) as the starting model. Although the d1-heme domains are almost identical in both enzyme structures, the c domain of NiR-Pa is more like the classical class I cytochrome-c fold because it has His51 and Met88  as heme ligands, instead of His17 and His69 present in NiR-Tp. In addition, the methionine-bearing loop, which was displaced by His17 of the NiR-Tp N-terminal segment, is back to normal in our structure. The N-terminal residues (5/6-30) of  NiR-Pa and NiR-Tp have little sequence identity. In Nir-Pa, this N-terminal segment of one monomer crosses the dimer interface and wraps itself around the other monomer. Tyr10 of this segment is hydrogen bonded to an hydroxide ion--the  sixth ligand of the d1-heme Fe, whereas the equivalent residue in NiR-Tp, Tyr25,  is directly bound to the Fe. CONCLUSIONS: Two ligands of hemes c and d1 differ between the two known NiR structures, which accounts for the fact that they have  quite different spectroscopic and kinetic features. The unexpected domain-crossing by the N-terminal segment of NiR-Pa is comparable to that of 'domain swapping' or 'arm exchange' previously observed in other systems and may  explain the observed cooperativity between monomers of dimeric NiR-Pa. In spite of having similar sequence and fold, the different kinetic behaviour and the spectral features of NiR-Pa and NiR-Tp are tuned by the N-terminal stretch of residues. A further example of this may come from another NiR, from Pseudomonas stutzeri, which has an N terminus very different from that of the two above mentioned NiRs.
