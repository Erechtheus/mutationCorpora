Solution structure of bovine angiogenin by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
The three-dimensional structure of bovine angiogenin has been determined using two- and three-dimensional proton NMR spectroscopy. The solution structure is very close to that recently determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. This structure appears well defined, even if five loops and one helix exhibit greater  flexibility. Analysis of the active site geometry confirms the position of the Glu-118 residue which obstructs the pyrimidine binding site. There is no experimental evidence of an unobstructed conformation of angiogenin in solution.  In addition, it appears that the Glu-118 and Ser-119 residues and the cell receptor binding loop may play an important role in the differences of C-terminal fragment organization and ribonucleolytic activity observed between angiogenins and ribonuclease A.
