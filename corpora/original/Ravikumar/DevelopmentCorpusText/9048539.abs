The structure of the superantigen exfoliative toxin A suggests a novel regulation as a serine protease.
Exfoliative toxin A (ETA) causes staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome which is characterized by a specific intraepidermal separation of layers of the skin. The  mechanism by which ETA causes skin separation is unknown although protease or superantigen activity has been implicated. The X-ray crystal structure of ETA has been solved in two crystal forms to 2.1 and 2.3 A resolution and R-factors of 17% and 19%, respectively. The structures indicate that ETA belongs to the chymotrypsin-like family of serine proteases and cleaves substrates after acidic  residues. The conformation of a loop adjacent to the catalytic site is suggested  to be key in regulating the proteolytic activity of ETA through controlling whether the main chain carbonyl group of Pro192 occupies the oxyanion hole. A unique amino-terminal domain containing a 15-residue amphipathic alpha helix may  also be involved in protease activation through binding a specific receptor. Substitution of the active site serine residue with cysteine abolishes the ability of ETA to produce the characteristic separation of epidermal layers but not its ability to induce T cell proliferation.
