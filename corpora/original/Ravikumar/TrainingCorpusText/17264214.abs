Structural basis for nucleotide exchange on G alpha i subunits and receptor coupling specificity.
Heterotrimeric G proteins are molecular switches that relay information intracellularly in response to various extracellular signals. How ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors act at a distance to exert exchange  activity on the Galpha nucleotide binding pocket is poorly understood. Here we describe the synergistic action of two peptides: one from the third intracellular loop of the D2 dopamine receptor (D2N), and a second, Galpha.GDP-binding peptide  (KB-752) that mimics the proposed role of Gbetagamma in receptor-promoted nucleotide exchange. The structure of both peptides in complex with Galpha(i1) suggests that conformational changes in the beta3/alpha2 loop and beta6 strand act in concert for efficient nucleotide exchange. Two key residues in the alpha4  helix were found to define a receptor/Galpha(i) coupling specificity determinant.
