Structure of NADH peroxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1 refined at 2.16 A resolution.
The crystal structure of NADH peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.1) from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1 (Enterococcus faecalis) has been refined to a resolution of 2.16 A  using the simulated annealing method. The final crystallographic R-factor is 17.7% for all data in the resolution range 7 to 2.16 A. The standard deviations are 0.015 A in bond lengths and 3.0 degrees in bond angles for the final model, which includes all 447 amino acid residues, one FAD and 369 water molecules. The  enzyme is a symmetrical tetramer with point group D2; the symmetry is crystallographic. The redox center of the enzyme consists of FAD and a cysteine (Cys42), which forms a sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) in its oxidized state. A histidine (His10) close to Cys42 is likely to act as an active-site base. In the analyzed crystal, the enzyme was in a non-native oxidation state with Cys42 oxidized to a  sulfonic acid Cys-SO3H. The chain fold of NADH peroxidase is similar to those of  disulfide oxidoreductases. A comparison with glutathione reductase, a representative of this enzyme family, is given.
