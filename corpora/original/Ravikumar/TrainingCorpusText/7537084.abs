Crystal structure of bovine heart phosphotyrosyl phosphatase at 2.2-A resolution.
The first X-ray crystallographic structure of a member of the class of low molecular weight (M(r) 18,000) phosphotyrosyl phosphatases is presented. Bovine heart phosphotyrosyl phosphatase (BHPTP) exemplifies this class and is highly homologous (94% sequence identity) to an isoenzyme known as red cell acid phosphatase that is present throughout human tissues. The high-resolution (2.2-A) crystal structure of BHPTP shows that the enzyme consists of a four-strand central parallel beta sheet with alpha helices packed on both sides in a manner characteristic of a Rossmann fold. A bound phosphate ion defines the active site  location in a loop of the first beta alpha beta motif at the C-terminus of the beta sheet. The location and enzymatic significance of the residues in the characteristic low molecular weight PTPase active site motif, including the essential arginine (Arg 18) and nucleophilic cysteine (Cys 12), are described. The functional role of a histidine (His 72) suggested previously to be near the active site is defined in the structure, as well as a potential proton donor for  the leaving group in the tyrosyl phosphate cleavage. Surface maps of BHPTP define a hydrophobic crevice suitable for phosphotyrosyl peptide binding. Comparison of  the BHPTP structure to the related, but structurally distinct enzyme PTP1B is made, illustrating the unique way this smallest of these phosphatases has formed  the phosphotyrosine active site.
