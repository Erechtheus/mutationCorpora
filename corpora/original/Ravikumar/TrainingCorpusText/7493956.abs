Crystallographic studies of the interaction of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase from Bacillus circulans strain 251 with natural substrates and products.
Asp-229, Glu-257, and Asp-328 constitute the catalytic residues in cyclodextrin glycosyl transferase from Bacillus circulans strain 251. Via site-directed mutagenesis constructed D229N, E257Q, and D328N mutant proteins showed a 4,000-60,000-fold reduction of cyclization activity. A D229N/E257Q double mutant  showed a 700,000-fold reduction and was crystallized for use in soaking experiments with alpha-cyclodextrin. Crystal structures were determined of wild type CGTase soaked at elevated pH with alpha-cyclodextrin (resolution, 2.1 A) and maltoheptaose (2.4 A). In addition, structures at cryogenic temperature were solved of the unliganded enzyme (2.2 A) and of the D229N/E257Q mutant after soaking with alpha-cyclodextrin (2.6 A). In the crystals soaked in alpha-cyclodextrin and maltoheptaose, a maltotetraose molecule is observed to bind in the active site. Residue 229 is at hydrogen bonding distance from the C-6 hydroxyl group of the sugar, which after cleavage will contain the new reducing end. In the D229N/E257Q double mutant structure, two alpha-cyclodextrins are observed to replace two maltoses at the E-domain, thus providing structural information on product inhibition via binding to the enzyme's raw starch binding  domain.
