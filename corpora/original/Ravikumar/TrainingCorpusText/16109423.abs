Structural snapshots of MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase along the reaction coordinate provide insights into enzyme and nucleoside flexibility during catalysis.
MTA/AdoHcy nucleosidase (MTAN) irreversibly hydrolyzes the N9-C1' bond in the nucleosides, 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) to  form adenine and the corresponding thioribose. MTAN plays a vital role in metabolic pathways involving methionine recycling, biological methylation, polyamine biosynthesis, and quorum sensing. Crystal structures of a wild-type (WT) MTAN complexed with glycerol, and mutant-enzyme and mutant-product complexes have been determined at 2.0A, 2.0A, and 2.1A resolution, respectively. The WT MTAN-glycerol structure provides a purine-free model and in combination with the  previously solved thioribose-free MTAN-ADE structure, we now have separate apo structures for both MTAN binding subsites. The purine and thioribose-free states  reveal an extensive enzyme-immobilized water network in their respective binding  subsites. The Asp197Asn MTAN-MTA and Glu12Gln MTAN-MTR.ADE structures are the first enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product complexes reported for MTAN, respectively. These structures provide representative snapshots along the reaction coordinate and allow insight into the conformational changes of the enzyme and the nucleoside substrate. A "catalytic movie" detailing substrate binding, catalysis, and product release is presented.
