ESI mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction studies of adducts between anticancer platinum drugs and hen egg white lysozyme.
The interactions of cisplatin and its analogues, transplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, with hen egg white lysozyme were analysed through ESI mass spectrometry, and the resulting metallodrug-protein adducts identified; the X-ray crystal structure of the cisplatin lysozyme derivative, solved at 1.9 A resolution, reveals selective platination of imidazole Nepsilon of His15.
