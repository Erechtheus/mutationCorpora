The 1.8 A structure of the complex between chymostatin and Streptomyces griseus protease A. A model for serine protease catalytic tetrahedral intermediates.
The naturally occurring serine protease inhibitor, chymostatin, forms a hemiacetal adduct with the catalytic Ser195 residue of Streptomyces griseus protease A. Restrained parameter least-squares refinement of this complex to 1.8  A resolution has produced an R index of 0 X 123 for the 11,755 observed reflections. The refined distance of the carbonyl carbon atom of the aldehyde to  O gamma of Ser195 is 1 X 62 A. Both the R and S configurations of the hemiacetal  occur in equal populations, with the end result resembling the expected configuration for a covalent tetrahedral product intermediate of a true substrate. This study strengthens the concept that serine proteases stabilize a covalent, tetrahedrally co-ordinated species and elaborates those features of the enzyme responsible for this effect. We propose that a major driving force for the hydrolysis of peptide bonds by serine proteases is the non-planar distortion of the scissile bond by the enzyme, which thereby lowers the activation energy barrier to hydrolysis by eliminating the resonance stabilization energy of the peptide bond.
