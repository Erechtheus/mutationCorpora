Cys114-linked dimers of transthyretin are compatible with amyloid formation.
The Tyr114Cys substitution in the human plasma protein transthyretin leads to a particularly aggressive form of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. In a previous study we demonstrated that ATTR Tyr114Cys forms intermolecular disulfide bonds, which partly impair fibril formation and result in a more amorphous morphology. Apart from the introduced cysteinyl group in position 114, the native sequence contains one cysteine located at position 10. To deduce the role of intermolecular disulfide bridging in fibril formation we generated and characterized the TTR Cys10Ala/Tyr114Cys double mutant. Our results suggest that  an intermolecular cysteine bridge at position 114 enhances the exposure of cysteine 10, thereby facilitating additional intermolecular cysteine assemblies.  We also purified a disulfide-linked dimeric form of TTR Cys10Ala/Tyr114Cys, which was recognized by the anti-TTR amyloid-specific monoclonal antibody MAb (39-44).  Moreover, this dimeric molecule can form protofibrils indistinguishable from the  fibrils formed under reducing conditions, as judged by atomic force microscopy. Assuming that both molecules of the dimer are part of the core of the fibril, the assembly is incompatible with a preserved native or near-native dimeric interphase. Our findings raise the question of whether TTR-amyloid architecture is indeed the result of one highly stringent assembly of structures or if different fibrils may be built from different underlying structures.
