Three-dimensional structures of the free and the antigen-complexed Fab from monoclonal anti-lysozyme antibody D44.1.
The three-dimensional structures of the free and antigen-complexed Fabs from the  mouse monoclonal anti-hen egg white lysozyme antibody D44.1 have been solved and  refined by X-ray crystallographic techniques. The crystals of the free and lysozyme-bound Fabs were grown under identical conditions and their X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.1 and 2.5 A, respectively. Two molecules of  the Fab-lysozyme complex in the asymmetric unit of the crystals show nearly identical conformations and thus confirm the essential structural features of the antigen-antibody interface. Three buried water molecules enhance the surface complementarity at the interface and provide hydrogen bonds to stabilize the complex. Two hydrophobic buried holes are present at the interface which, although large enough to accommodate solvent molecules, are void. The combining site residues of the complexed FabD44.1 exhibit reduced temperature factors compared with those of the free Fab. Furthermore, small perturbations in atomic positions and rearrangements of side-chains at the combining site, and a relative rearrangement of the variable domains of the light (VL) and the heavy (VH) chains, detail a Fab accommodation of the bound lysozyme. The amino acid sequence of the VH domain, as well as the epitope of lysozyme recognized by D44.1 are very close to those previously reported for the monoclonal antibody HyHEL-5. A feature central to the FabD44.1 and FabHyHEL-5 complexes with lysozyme are three salt bridges between VH glutamate residues 35 and 50 and lysozyme arginine residues 45 and 68. The presence of the three salt bridges in the D44.1-lysozyme interface indicates that these bonds are not responsible for the 1000-fold increase in affinity for lysozyme that HyHEL-5 exhibits relative to D44.1.
