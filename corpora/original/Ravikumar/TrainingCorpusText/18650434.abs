S100A1 and calmodulin compete for the same binding site on ryanodine receptor.
In heart and skeletal muscle an S100 protein family member, S100A1, binds to the  ryanodine receptor (RyR) and promotes Ca(2+) release. Using competition binding assays, we further characterized this system in skeletal muscle and showed that Ca(2+)-S100A1 competes with Ca(2+)-calmodulin (CaM) for the same binding site on  RyR1. In addition, the NMR structure was determined for Ca(2+)-S100A1 bound to a  peptide derived from this CaM/S100A1 binding domain, a region conserved in RyR1 and RyR2 and termed RyRP12 (residues 3616-3627 in human RyR1). Examination of the S100A1-RyRP12 complex revealed residues of the helical RyRP12 peptide (Lys-3616,  Trp-3620, Lys-3622, Leu-3623, Leu-3624, and Lys-3626) that are involved in favorable hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with Ca(2+)-S100A1. These same residues were shown previously to be important for RyR1 binding to Ca(2+)-CaM. A model for regulating muscle contraction is presented in which Ca(2+)-S100A1 and Ca(2+)-CaM compete directly for the same binding site on the ryanodine receptor.
