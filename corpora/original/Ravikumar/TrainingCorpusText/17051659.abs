Natural and non-natural antenna chromophores in the DNA photolyase from Thermus thermophilus.
X-ray crystallographic and functional analysis of the class I DNA photolyase from Thermus thermophilus revealed the binding of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as an antenna chromophore. The binding mode of FMN closely coincides with the binding of a deazaflavin-like chromophore in the related class I DNA photolyase from Anacystis nidulans. Compared to the R46E mutant, which lacks a conserved arginine in the binding site for the antenna chromophore, the FMN-comprising holophotolyase exhibits an eightfold higher activity at 450 nm. The facile incorporation of the flavin cofactors 8-hydroxy-deazariboflavin and 8-iodo-8-demethyl-riboflavin into the binding site for the antenna chromophore paves the way for wavelength-tuning of the activity spectra of DNA photolyases by using synthetic flavins.
