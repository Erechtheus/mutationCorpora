Three-dimensional structure of the Escherichia coli phosphocarrier protein IIIglc.
The crystal structure of a proteolytically modified form of the Escherichia coli  phosphocarrier and signal transducing protein IIIglc has been determined by multiple isomorphous and molecular replacement. The model has been refined to an  R-factor of 0.166 for data between 6- and 2.1-A resolution with an rms deviation  of 0.020 A from ideal bond lengths and 3.2 degrees from ideal bond angles. The molecule is a beta-sheet sandwich, with six antiparallel strands on either side.  Several short distorted helices line the periphery of the active site, which is a shallow extremely hydrophobic depression approximately 18 A in diameter near the  center of one face. The side chains of the active site histidine residues 75 and  90 face each other at the center of the depression, with the N3 positions exposed to solvent, separated by 3.3 A in an excellent position to form adducts with phosphate. Chloroplatinate forms a divalent adduct with both histidyl side chains, suggesting that the phosphodonor reaction might proceed through a similar transition state. The hydrophobic patch forms the primary crystal contact, suggesting a mode of association of IIIglc with other components of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system.
