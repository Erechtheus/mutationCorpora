Monocyclic thiophenes as protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitors: capturing interactions with Asp48.
A series of monocyclic thiophenes was designed and synthesized as PTP1B inhibitors. Guided by X-ray co-crystal structural information and computational modeling, rational design led to key interactions with Asp48 and improved inhibitory potency against PTP1B.
