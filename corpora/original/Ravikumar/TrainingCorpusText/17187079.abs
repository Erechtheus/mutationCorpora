Structure of acid beta-glucosidase with pharmacological chaperone provides insight into Gaucher disease.
Gaucher disease results from mutations in the lysosomal enzyme acid beta-glucosidase (GCase). Although enzyme replacement therapy has improved the health of some affected individuals, such as those with the prevalent N370S mutation, oral treatment with pharmacological chaperones may be therapeutic in a  wider range of tissue compartments by restoring sufficient activity of endogenous mutant GCase. Here we demonstrate that isofagomine (IFG, 1) binds to the GCase active site, and both increases GCase activity in cell lysates and restores lysosomal trafficking in cells containing N370S mutant GCase. We also compare the crystal structures of IFG-bound GCase at low pH with those of glycerol-bound GCase at low pH and apo-GCase at neutral pH. Our data indicate that IFG induces active GCase, which is secured by interactions with Asn370. The design of small molecules that stabilize substrate-bound conformations of mutant proteins may be  a general therapeutic strategy for diseases caused by protein misfolding and mistrafficking.
