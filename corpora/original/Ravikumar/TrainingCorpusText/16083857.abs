Crystal structure of human sulfotransferase SULT1A3 in complex with dopamine and  3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate.
The human sulfotransferase, SULT1A3, catalyzes specifically the sulfonation of monoamines such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. SULT1A3 also has a  unique 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa)/tyrosine-sulfating activity that is preferentially toward their D-form enantiomers and can be stimulated dramatically by Mn2+. To further our understanding of the molecular basis for the unique substrate specificity of this enzyme, we solved the crystal structure of human SULT1A3, complexed with dopamine and 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate, at 2.6 A resolution and carried out autodocking analysis with D-Dopa. The structure of SULT1A3 enzyme-ligand complex clearly showed that residue Glu146 can form electrostatic interaction with dopamine and may play a pivotal role in the stereoselectivity and sulfating activity. On the other hand, residue Asp86 appeared to be critical to the Mn2+-stimulation of the Dopa/tyrosine-sulfating activity of SULT1A3, in addition to a supporting role in the stereoselectivity and sulfating activity.
