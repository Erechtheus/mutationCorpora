Effects of engineered salt bridges on the stability of subtilisin BPN'.
Variants designed using PROTEUS have been produced in an attempt to engineer stabilizing salt bridges into subtilisin BPN'. All the mutants constructed by site-directed mutagenesis were secreted by Bacillus subtilis, except L75K. Q19E,  expressed as a single variant and also in a double variant, Q19E/Q271E, appears to form a stabilizing salt bridge based on X-ray crystal structure determination  and differential scanning calorimeter measurements. Although the double mutant was found to be less thermodynamically stable than the wild-type, it did exhibit  an autolytic stability about two-fold greater under hydrophobic conditions. Four  variants, A98K, S89E, V26R and L235R, were found to be nearly identical to wild-type in thermal stability, indicative of stable structures without evidence  of salt bridge formation. Variants Q271E, V51K and T164R led to structures that resulted in varying degrees of thermodynamic and autolytic instability. A computer-modeling analysis of the PROTEUS predictions reveals that the low percentage of salt bridge formation is probably due to an overly simplistic electrostatic model, which does not account for the geometry of the pairwise interactions.
