Structure of T4moC, the Rieske-type ferredoxin component of toluene 4-monooxygenase.
The structure of the Rieske-type ferredoxin (T4moC) from toluene 4-monooxygenase  was determined by X-ray crystallography in the [2Fe-2S](2+) state at a resolution of 1.48 A using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing with the [2Fe-2S]  center. The structure consists of ten beta-strands arranged into the three antiparallel beta-sheet topology observed in all Rieske proteins. Trp69 of T4moC  is adjacent to the [2Fe-2S] centre, which displaces a loop containing the conserved Pro81 by approximately 8 A away from the [2Fe-2S] cluster compared with the Pro loop in the closest structural and functional homolog, the Rieske-type ferredoxin BphF from biphenyl dioxygenase. In addition, T4moC contains five hydrogen bonds to the [2Fe-2S] cluster compared with three hydrogen bonds in BphF. Moreover, the electrostatic surface of T4moC is distinct from that of BphF. These structural differences are identified as possible contributors to the evolutionary specialization of soluble Rieske-type ferredoxins between the diiron monooxygenases and cis-dihydrodiol-forming dioxygenases.
