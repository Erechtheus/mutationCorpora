Dissecting the determinants of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor selectivity.
Cyclin dependent kinases are a key family of kinases involved in cell cycle regulation and are an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy. The roles of four residues of the cyclin-dependent kinase active site in inhibitor selectivity were investigated by producing cyclin-dependent kinase 2 mutants bearing equivalent cyclin-dependent kinase 4 residues, namely F82H, L83V, H84D, and K89T. Assay of the mutants with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4-selective bisanilinopyrimidine shows that the K89T mutation is primarily responsible for the selectivity of this compound. Use of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2-selective  6-cyclohexylmethoxy-2-(4'-sulfamoylanilino)purine (NU6102) shows that K89T has no role in the selectivity, while the remaining three mutations have a cumulative influence. The results indicate that certain residues that are not frequently considered in structure-aided kinase inhibitor design have an important role to play.
