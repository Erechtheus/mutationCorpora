Crystal structure of the tyrosine kinase domain of the human insulin receptor.
The X-ray crystal structure of the tyrosine kinase domain of the human insulin receptor has been determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing and refined to 2.1 A resolution. The structure reveals the determinants of substrate  preference for tyrosine rather than serine or threonine and a novel autoinhibition mechanism whereby one of the tyrosines that is autophosphorylated  in response to insulin, Tyr 1,162, is bound in the active site.
