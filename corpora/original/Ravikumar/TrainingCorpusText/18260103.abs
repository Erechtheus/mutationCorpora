Thermal stabilization of the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica alcohol dehydrogenase by a single proline substitution.
Analysis of the three-dimensional structures of two closely related thermophilic  and hyperthermophilic alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) from the respective microorganisms Entamoeba histolytica (EhADH1) and Thermoanaerobacter brockii (TbADH) suggested that a unique, strategically located proline residue (Pro275) at the center of the dimerization interface might be crucial for maintaining the  thermal stability of TbADH. To assess the contribution of Pro275 to the thermal stability of the ADHs, we applied site-directed mutagenesis to replace Asp275 of  EhADH1 with Pro (D275P-EhADH1) and conversely Pro275 of TbADH with Asp (P275D-TbADH). The results indicate that replacing Asp275 with Pro significantly  enhances the thermal stability of EhADH1 (DeltaT(1/2) <or= +10 degrees C), whereas the reverse mutation in the thermophilic TbADH (P275D-TbADH) reduces the  thermostability of the enzyme (DeltaT(1/2) <or= -18.8 degrees C). Analysis of the crystal structures of the thermostabilized mutant D275P-EhADH1 and the thermocompromised mutant P275D-TbADH suggest that a proline residue at position 275 thermostabilized the enzymes by reducing flexibility and by reinforcing hydrophobic interactions at the dimer-dimer interface of the tetrameric ADHs.
