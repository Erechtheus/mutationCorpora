Enzyme-substrate interactions. Structure of human carbonic anhydrase I complexed  with bicarbonate.
The structure of HCAI-HCO3- complex has been refined with 10-1.6A X-ray diffraction data to an R-value of 17.7%. The structure reveals monodentate binding of the HCO3- anion at an apical tetrahedral position to the zinc ion. The binding mode and interactions of HCO3- in HCAI differ from that in HCAII. The activity linked H2O/OH- group in the free HCAI is replaced by the hydroxyl group  of the bicarbonate anion. This result rules out the rearrangement of the bound HCO3- advocated earlier to explain the microscopic reversibility of the catalysed reaction. From the geometry of the H-bonds between Glu106-Thr199 pair and Glu117-His119 couple, the glutamic acids are expected to be ionized and accept H-bonds from their partners. The product-inhibiton by HCO3- anion is explained on the basis of proton localization on His119 in the Glu117-His119 couple. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Glu117-His119 tunes the ionicity  of the Zn2+ and the binding strength of HCO3- anion. A pi hydrogen bond is observed between a water and phenyl ring of the Tyr114 residue.
