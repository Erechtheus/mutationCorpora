Crystal structure of haemoglobin from donkey (Equus asinus) at 3A resolution.
Haemoglobin from donkey was purified and crystallized in space group C2. The present donkey haemoglobin model comprises of two subunits alpha and beta. These  alpha and beta subunits comprise of 141 and 146 amino acid residues, respectively, and the haem groups. The donkey haemoglobin differs from horse only in two amino acids of alpha-chain (His20 to Asn and Tyr24 to Phe) and these substitutions do not significantly change the secondary structural features of donkey haemoglobin. The haem group region and subunit contacts are closely resemble with that of horse methaemoglobin.
