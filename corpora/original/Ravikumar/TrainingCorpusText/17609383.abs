Identifying important structural characteristics of arsenic resistance proteins by using designed three-stranded coiled coils.
Arsenic, a contaminant of water supplies worldwide, is one of the most toxic inorganic ions. Despite arsenic's health impact, there is relatively little structural detail known about its interactions with proteins. Bacteria such as Escherichia coli have evolved arsenic resistance using the Ars operon that is regulated by ArsR, a repressor protein that dissociates from DNA when As(III) binds. This protein undergoes a critical conformational change upon binding As(III) with three cysteine residues. Unfortunately, structures of ArsR with or without As(III) have not been reported. Alternatively, de novo designed peptides  can bind As(III) in an endo configuration within a thiolate-rich environment consistent with that proposed for both ArsR and ArsD. We report the structure of  the As(III) complex of Coil Ser L9C to a 1.8-A resolution, providing x-ray characterization of As(III) in a Tris thiolate protein environment and allowing a structural basis by which to understand arsenated ArsR.
