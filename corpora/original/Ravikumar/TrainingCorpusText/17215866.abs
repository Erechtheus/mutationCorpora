Recognition of ribosomal protein L11 by the protein trimethyltransferase PrmA.
Bacterial ribosomal protein L11 is post-translationally trimethylated at multiple residues by a single methyltransferase, PrmA. Here, we describe four structures of PrmA from the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus. Two apo-PrmA structures at 1.59 and 2.3 A resolution and a third with bound cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine at 1.75 A each exhibit distinct relative positions of the substrate recognition and catalytic domains, revealing how PrmA can position the  L11 substrate for multiple, consecutive side-chain methylation reactions. The fourth structure, the PrmA-L11 enzyme-substrate complex at 2.4 A resolution, illustrates the highly specific interaction of the N-terminal domain with its substrate and places Lys39 in the PrmA active site. The presence of a unique flexible loop in the cofactor-binding site suggests how exchange of AdoMet with the reaction product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine can occur without necessitating the dissociation of PrmA from L11. Finally, the mode of interaction of PrmA with  L11 explains its observed preference for L11 as substrate before its assembly into the 50S ribosomal subunit.
