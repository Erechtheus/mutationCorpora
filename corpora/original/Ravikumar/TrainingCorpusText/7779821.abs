Nature of the inactivation of elastase by N-peptidyl-O-aroyl hydroxylamine as a function of pH.
The mechanism of inactivation of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) by N-peptidyl-O-aroylhydroxylamine was studied by X-ray crystallography. The inactivator forms a stable complex with the enzyme by means of a covalent attachment to the active site Ser 203(195) O gamma. The nature of the complex is, however, different depending on the pH at which the inactivation reaction occurs. At pH 5, the complex formed is a hydroxylamine derivative of Ser 203(195) in which the O gamma of serine is the oxygen of the hydroxylamine derivative. At pH  7.5, the complex formed is a carbamate derivative at Ser 203(195) O gamma. In both types of complexes, the inactivator binds in the S' subsites of the enzyme instead of forming the usual antiparallel beta-sheet with the S subsites. The implication for the mechanism of inactivation at different pHs is discussed.
