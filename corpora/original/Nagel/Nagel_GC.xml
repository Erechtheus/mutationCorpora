<plain><p>Syntaxin 1A</p> consists of 288 amino acid residues including a 265-residue N-terminal region exposed to the cytoplasm and a C-terminal hydrophobic stretch of 23 residues believed to anchor syntaxin to the plasma membrane </plain>
<plain>Using a <o>human</o> fat-cell library we have isolated a novel cDNA clone of <p>syntaxin 1A</p> containing an insert of 91 bp in codon 226 </plain>

<plain>The elementary <p>IF</p> 'building block' is an elongated coiled-coil dimer consisting of four consecutive alpha-helical segments </plain>
<plain>The segments 1A and 2B include highly conserved sequences and are critically involved in <p>IF</p> assembly </plain>
<plain>Based on the crystal structures of three <o>human</o> <p>vimentin</p> fragments at 1.4-2.3 A resolution (PDB entries 1gk4, 1gk6 and 1gk7), we have established the molecular organization of these two segments </plain>
<plain>The fragment corresponding to segment 1A forms a single, amphipatic alpha-helix, which is compatible with a coiled-coil geometry </plain>
<plain>While this segment might yield a coiled coil within an isolated dimer, monomeric 1A helices are likely to play a role in specific dimer-dimer interactions during <p>IF</p> assembly </plain>
<plain>The 2B segment reveals a double-stranded coiled coil, which unwinds near residue <r type="site">Phe351</r> to accommodate a 'stutter' </plain>
<plain>A fragment containing the last seven heptads of 2B interferes heavily with <p>IF</p> assembly and also transforms mature <p>vimentin filaments</p> into a new kind of structure </plain>

<plain>BACKGROUND: Intronic DNA sequences of the <p>canine arrestin</p> (<p>SAG</p>) gene was screened to identify potential disease causing mutations in <o>dogs</o> with generalized progressive retinal atrophy (gPRA) </plain>
<plain>The intronic sequences flanking each of the 16 exons were obtained from clones of a <o>canine</o> genomic library </plain>
<plain>RESULTS: Using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequence analyses we screened affected and unaffected dogs of 23 breeds with presumed autosomal recessively (ar) transmitted gPRA </plain>
<plain>In the coding region of the <p>SAG</p> gene 12 nucleotide exchanges were identified, 5 of which lead to amino acid substitutions ( <r type="site">H14C</r>; <r type="site">A111V</r>; <r type="site">A113T</r>; <r type="site">D259T</r>; <r type="site">A379E</r>) </plain>

<plain>We have analyzed the most recently available genomic sequence of the <o>human</o> S100 gene cluster for evidence of tandem gene duplications during primate evolutionary history </plain>
<plain>The sequences obtained from both GenBank and GoldenPath were analyzed in detail using various comparative sequence analysis tools </plain>
<plain>We found that of the S100A genes clustered relatively closely together within a genomic region of 260 kb, only the S100A7 (psoriasin) gene region showed evidence of recent duplications </plain>
<plain>The S100A7 gene duplicated region is composed of three distinct genomic regions, 33, 11, and 31 kb, respectively, that together harbor at least five identifiable S100A7-like genes </plain>
<plain>Regions 1 and 3 are in opposite orientation to each other, but each region carries two S100A7-like genes separated by an 11-kb intergenic region (region 2) that has only one S100A7-like gene, providing limited sequence resemblance to regions 1 and 3 </plain>
<plain>The duplicated genomic regions 1 and 3 share a number of different retroelements including five Alu subfamily members that serve as molecular clocks </plain>
<plain>The shared (paralogous) Alu S insertions suggest that regions 1 and 3 were probably duplicated during or after the phase of AluS amplification some 30-40 mya </plain>
<plain>We used PCR to amplify an indel within intron 1 of the S100A7a and S100A7c genes that gave the same two expected product sizes using 40 <o>human</o> DNA samples and 1 <o>chimpanzee</o> sample, therefore confirming the presence of the region 1 and 3 duplication in these species </plain>
<plain>Comparative genomic analysis of the other S100 gene members shows no similarity between intergenic regions, suggesting that they diverged long before the emergence of the <o>primates</o> </plain>
<plain>This view was supported by the phylogenetic analysis of different <o>human</o> S100 proteins including the <o>human</o> S100A7 protein members </plain>
<plain>The S100A7 protein, also known as psoriasin, has important functions as a mediator and regulator in skin differentiation and disease (psoriasis), in breast cancer, and as a chemotactic factor for inflammatory cells </plain>

<plain><p>Vps4p</p> (<p>End13p</p>) is an <p>AAA-family ATPase</p> that functions in membrane transport through endosomes, sorting of soluble vacuolar proteins to the vacuole, and multivesicular body (MVB) sorting of membrane proteins to the vacuole lumen </plain>
<plain>In a yeast two-hybrid screen with <p>Vps4p</p> as bait we isolated <p>VPS20</p> (<p>YMR077c</p>) and the novel open reading frame <p>YLR181c</p>, for which the name <p>VTA1</p> has recently been assigned (Saccharomyces Genome Database) </plain>
<plain><p>Vps4p</p> directly binds <p>Vps20p</p> and <p>Vta1p</p> in vitro and binding is not dependent on ATP - conversely, <p>Vps4p</p> binding to <p>Vps20p</p> is partially sensitive to ATP hydrolysis </plain>
<plain>Both <a>ATP binding</a> [<p>Vps4p</p> -(<r type="site">K179A</r>)] and <a>ATP hydrolysis</a> [<p>Vps4p</p>-(<r type="site">E233Q</r>)] mutant proteins exhibit enhanced binding to <p>Vps20p</p> and <p>Vta1p</p> in vitro </plain>
<plain>The Vps4p-Vps20p interaction involves the coiled-coil domain of each protein, whereas the Vps4p-Vta1p interaction involves the (non-coiled-coil) C-terminus of each protein </plain>
<plain>Deletion of either <p>VPS20</p> (vps20Delta) or <p>VTA1</p> (vta1Delta) leads to similar class E Vps- phenotypes resembling those of vps4Delta, including carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) secretion, a block in ubiquitin-dependent MVB sorting, and a delay in both post-internalisation endocytic transport and biosynthetic transport to the vacuole </plain>
<plain>The vacuole resident membrane protein <p>Sna3p</p> (whose MVB sorting is ubiquitin-independent) does not appear to exit the class E compartment or reach the vacuole in cells lacking <p>Vps20p</p>, <p>Vta1p</p> or <p>Vps4p</p>, in contrast to other proteins whose delivery to the vacuole is only delayed </plain>
<plain>We propose that <p>Vps20p</p> and <p>Vta1p</p> regulate <p>Vps4p</p> function in vivo </plain>
