The rate-limiting, hormonally regulated step in the biological activation of vitamin D is its 1alpha-hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)(2)D] in the kidney, catalyzed by the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme, P450c1alpha . 
We previously cloned the human P450c1alpha cDNA and gene, and identified 14 different mutations, including 7 missense, in 19 patients with 1alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, also known as vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1 . 
None of the missense mutations encoded a protein with detectable enzymatic activity in vitro . 
Although there is phenotypic variation among such patients, the molecular basis of this variation is unknown . 
We analyzed 6 additional patients with clinical and radiographic features of rickets; in 4 patients the laboratory abnormalities were typical of 1alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, but in 2 they were unusually mild [mild hypocalcemia and normal serum 1,25-(OH)(2)D concentration] . 
Direct sequencing revealed that all patients had P450c1alpha mutations on both alleles . 
Five new and 2 known mutations were identified . 
The new mutations included a 5-bp deletion with a 6-bp novel insertion causing a frameshift in exon 2, and a G to A change at +1 of intron 2; a minigene experiment proved that this intronic mutation prevented proper splicing . 
Three new missense mutations were found and tested by expressing the mutant cDNA in mouse Leydig MA-10 cells . 
The R389G mutant was totally inactive, but mutant L343F retained 2.3% of wild-type activity, and mutant E189G retained 22% of wild-type activity . 
The two mutations that confer partial enzyme activity in vitro were found in the 2 patents with mild laboratory abnormalities, suggesting that such mutations contribute to the phenotypic variation observed in patients with 1alpha-hydroxylase deficiency .
