The complete amino acid sequence of a factor V activator (VLFVA) is deduced from the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA encoding the enzyme . 
The cDNA was isolated by PCR screening a venomous gland cDNA library of Central Asian Vipera lebetina snake . 
The full-length cDNA clone, derived from two overlapping fragments, comprises 1563 basepairs which encode an open reading frame of 259 amino acids . 
The amino acid sequence of VLFVA (235 amino acids) shows significant homology with snake venom and mammalian serine proteinases . 
It contains 12 half-cysteines which form, by analogy with other serine proteinases, 6 disulfide bridges . 
VLFVA has the catalytic triad His43-Asp88-Ser182 . 
The amino terminal amino acid valine is preceded by 24 amino acids: a putative signal peptide of 18, mainly hydrophobic, amino acids and an activating peptide of 6, mainly hydrophilic amino acid residues . 
This is the first cloned factor V activating enzyme from snake venom .
