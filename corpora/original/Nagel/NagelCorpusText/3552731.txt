To determine the modes of three disulfide linkages in the heat-stable enterotoxin (STh) produced by a human strain of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, we synthesized STh(6-18), which consists of 13 amino acid residues and has the same intramolecular disulfide linkages as native STh [(1985) FEBS Lett . 
181, 138-142], by stepwise and selective formation of disulfide bonds using different types of removable protecting groups for the Cys residues . 
Synthesis of the peptide with different modes of disulfide bond formation provided three peptides consistent with standard STh(6-18) in their physicochemical and biological properties, thereby indicating that the disulfide bonds in STh(6-18) are Cys-Cys-Glu-Leu-Cys-Cys-Asn-Pro-Ala-Cys-Thr-Gly-Cys .
