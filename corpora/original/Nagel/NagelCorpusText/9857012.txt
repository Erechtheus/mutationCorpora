Glycogenin-2 is a recently described self-glucosylating protein potentially involved in the initiation of glycogen biosynthesis (Mu, J., Skurat, A .

In human liver extracts, most of the glycogenin-2 was only detectable after treatment with alpha-amylase . 
Similarly, purifed high Mr glycogen was only detected after release by alpha-amylase treatment . 
Based on analysis by polymerase chain reaction, the predominant isoform in liver was glycogenin-2beta . 
Glycogenin-2 was found in Ewing's sarcoma RD-ES cells where, however, it was not associated with high Mr carbohydrate . 
Both human liver and human RD-ES cell extracts also contained glycogenin-1 . 
Glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2 interact with one another, based on in vitro interactions and co-immunoprecipitation from liver and cell extracts . 
Mutation of Tyr-196 in glycogenin-2 to a Phe residue abolished the ability of glycogenin-2 to self-glucosylate but not to interact with glycogenin-1 . 
Stable overexpression of glycogenin-2alpha in Rat-1 fibroblast cells resulted in a 5-fold increase in the level of glycogen present in the low speed pellet but little change in the low speed supernatant . 
This result is important since it indicates that the level of glycogenin-2 can determine glycogen accumulation and hence has the potential to control glycogen synthesis .
