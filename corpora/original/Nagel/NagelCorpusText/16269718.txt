Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells generally cannot synthesize biotin, a vitamin required for many carboxylation reactions . 
Although sake yeasts, which are used for Japanese sake brewing, are classified as S. cerevisiae, they do not require biotin for their growth . 
In this study, we identified a novel open reading frame (ORF) in the genome of one strain of sake yeast that we speculated to be involved in biotin synthesis . 
Homologs of this gene are widely distributed in the genomes of sake yeasts . 
However, they are not found in many laboratory strains and strains used for wine making and beer brewing . 
This ORF was named BIO6 because it has 52% identity with BIO3, a biotin biosynthesis gene of a laboratory strain . 
Further research showed that yeasts without the BIO6 gene are auxotrophic for biotin, whereas yeasts holding the BIO6 gene are prototrophic for biotin . 
The BIO6 gene was disrupted in strain A364A, which is a laboratory strain with one copy of the BIO6 gene . 
Although strain A364A is prototrophic for biotin, a BIO6 disrupted mutant was found to be auxotrophic for biotin . 
The BIO6 disruptant was able to grow in biotin-deficient medium supplemented with 7-keto-8-amino-pelargonic acid (KAPA), while the bio3 disruptant was not able to grow in this medium . 
These results suggest that Bio6p acts in an unknown step of biotin synthesis before KAPA synthesis . 
Furthermore, we demonstrated that expression of the BIO6 gene, like that of other biotin synthesis genes, was upregulated by depletion of biotin . 
We conclude that the BIO6 gene is a novel biotin biosynthesis gene of S. cerevisiae .
