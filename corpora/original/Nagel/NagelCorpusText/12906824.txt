The structure of human phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) synthetase was determined at 2.3 A resolution . 
PPC synthetase is a dimer with identical monomers . 
Some features of the monomer fold resemble a group of NAD-dependent enzymes, while other features resemble the ribokinase fold . 
The ATP, phosphopantothenate, and cysteine binding sites were deduced from modeling studies . 
Highly conserved ATP binding residues include Gly43, Ser61, Gly63, Gly66, Phe230, and Asn258 . 
Highly conserved phosphopantothenate binding residues include Asn59, Ala179, Ala180, and Asp183 from one monomer and Arg55' from the adjacent monomer . 
The structure predicts a ping pong mechanism with initial formation of an acyladenylate intermediate, followed by release of pyrophosphate and attack by cysteine to form the final products PPC and AMP .
