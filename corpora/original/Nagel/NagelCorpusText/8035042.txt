A strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to ofloxacin was selected in a patient with a long history of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis eventually treated by ofloxacin combined with other second-line drugs . 
A mutation in the gyrA gene was hypothesized to be the mechanism of acquired resistance to ofloxacin in this strain . 
Chromosomal DNA of strains MTB1, isolated before treatment and susceptible to ofloxacin (MIC, 1 microgram/mL), and MTB2, isolated during treatment and resistant to ofloxacin (MIC, 32 micrograms/mL), was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two oligonucleotide primers highly homologous to DNA sequences flanking the quinolone resistance-determining region in gyrA p of mycobacteria . 
Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the 150-bp fragments obtained by PCR revealed a point mutation in MTB2 leading to the substitution of histidine for aspartic acid at a position corresponding to residues involved in quinolone resistance in Escherichia coli (Asp87), Staphylococcus aureus (Glu88), and Campylobacter jejuni (Asp90) .
