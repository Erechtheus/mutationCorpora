1-Deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) reductoisomerase, which simultaneously catalyzes the intramolecular rearrangement and reduction of DXP to form 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate, constitutes a key enzyme of an alternative mevalonate-independent pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis . 
The dxr gene encoding this enzyme from Escherichia coli was overexpressed as a histidine-tagged protein and characterized in detail . 
DNA sequencing analysis of the dxr genes from 10 E. coli dxr-deficient mutants revealed base substitution mutations at four points: two nonsense mutations and two amino acid substitutions (Gly(14) to Asp(14) and Glu(231) to Lys(231)) . 
Diethyl pyrocarbonate treatment inactivated DXP reductoisomerase, and subsequent hydroxylamine treatment restored the activity of the diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated enzyme . 
To characterize these defects, we overexpressed the mutant enzymes G14D, E231K, H153Q, H209Q, and H257Q . 
All of these mutant enzymes except for G14D were obtained as soluble proteins . 
Although the purified enzyme E231K had wild-type K(m) values for DXP and NADPH, the mutant enzyme had less than a 0.24% wild-type k(cat) value . 
K(m) values of H153Q, H209Q, and H257Q for DXP increased to 3.5-, 7.6-, and 19-fold the wild-type value, respectively . 
These results indicate that Glu(231) of E. coli DXP reductoisomerase plays an important role(s) in the conversion of DXP to 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate, and that His(153), His(209), and His(257), in part, associate with DXP binding in the enzyme molecule .
