The crystal structure of abrin-a, a type II ribosome-inactivating protein from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, has been determined from a novel crystalline form by the molecular replacement method using the coordinates of ricin . 
The structure has been refined at 2.14 A to a R-factor of 18.9% . 
The root-mean-square deviations of bond lengths and angles from the standard values are 0.013 A and 1.82 degrees, respectively . 
The overall protein folding is similar to that of ricin, but there are differences in the secondary structure, mostly of the A-chain . 
Several parts of the molecular surface differ significantly; some of them are quite near the active site cleft, and probably influence ribosome recognition . 
The positions of invariant active site residues remain the same, except the position of Tyr74 . 
Two water molecules of hydrogen-bonded active site residues have been located in the active site cleft . 
Both of them may be responsible for hydrolyzing the N-C glycosidic bond . 
The current abrin-a structure is lactose free; this is probably essential for abrin-a crystallization . 
The B-chain is a glycoprotein, and the positions of several sugar residues of two sugar chains linked to earlier predicted glycosylation sites were determined . 
One of the sugar chains is a bridge between two neighboring molecules, since one of its mannose residues is connected to the galactose binding site of the neighboring molecule . 
Another sugar chain covers the surface of the B-chain .
