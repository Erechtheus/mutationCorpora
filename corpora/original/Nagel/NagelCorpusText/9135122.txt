Refined ensembles of solution structures have been calculated for the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (N-SH3) complexed with the ac-VPPPVPPRRR-nh2 peptide derived from residues 1135 to 1144 of the mouse SOS-1 sequence . 
NMR spectra obtained from different combinations of both 13C-15N-labeled and unlabeled N-SH3 and SOS peptide fragment were used to obtain stereo-assignments for pro-chiral groups of the peptide, angle restraints via heteronuclear coupling constants, and complete 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments for both molecules . 
One ensemble of structures was calculated using conventional methods while a second ensemble was generated by including additional direct refinements against both 1H and 13C(alpha)/13C(beta) chemical shifts . 
In both ensembles, the protein:peptide interface is highly resolved, reflecting the inclusion of 110 inter-molecular nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) distance restraints . 
The first and second peptide-binding sub-sites of N-SH3 interact with structurally well-defined portions of the peptide . 
These interactions include hydrogen bonds and extensive hydrophobic contacts . 
In the third highly acidic sub-site, the conformation of the peptide Arg8 side-chain is partially ordered by a set of NOE restraints to the Trp36 ring protons . 
Overall, several lines of evidence point to dynamical averaging of peptide and N-SH3 side-chain conformations in the third subsite . 
These conformations are characterized by transient charge stabilized hydrogen bond interactions between the peptide arginine side-chain hydrogen bond donors and either single, or possibly multiple, acceptor(s) in the third peptide-binding sub-site .
