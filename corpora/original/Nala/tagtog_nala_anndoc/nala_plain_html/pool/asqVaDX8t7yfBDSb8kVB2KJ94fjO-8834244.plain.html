          <p id="s1p1">Novel trinucleotide deletion in Fabry's disease.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">We describe the molecular characterization of a novel, in-frame deletion that is located in exon 7 of the alpha-galactosidase A gene in a patient with Fabry's disease. The 3-bp deletion we identified, besides the typical severe clinical features, also expresses diffuse facial telangiectasias, which is a new cutaneous marker of Fabry's disease.</p>
