                "text": "Human mutation\nOsteopontin (SPP1) is a soluble ligand with pleomorphic immunologic activities including activation of macrophage chemotaxis, promotion of Th1 responses, and activation of B1 B cells. It has been implicated in the development of murine lupus and is overexpressed in humans with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We examined a polymorphism of osteopontin for an association with lupus in humans in an effort to determine whether there is any evidence that a genetic predisposition to altered osteopontin expression might explain the overexpression seen in human SLE patients. A silent polymorphism (707C>T, rs1126616) of osteopontin was significantly associated with SLE. Additional associations with renal disease and opportunisitic infections were suggested. This is the first phenotypic association with a polymorphic variant of osteopontin.",

High cellular cholesterol load promotes Abeta formation. The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates cholesterol efflux from cells. We hypothesized that genetic variability in ABCA1 may influence cholesterol metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS) and, thus, interfere with the development of AD. Healthy elderly carriers of the A allele of a non-synonymous (R219K) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ABCA1 gene (rs2234884) had on average 33% lower total cholesterol in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than non-carriers. In 169 patients with late onset, sporadic AD, this allele was associated with delayed age at onset of the disease by 1.7 years on average. Rs2234884 and another non-synonymous SNP (R1587K) in ABCA1 (rs2234886) failed to show significant association with the risk for AD. We conclude that genetic variability of ABCA1 influences the development of AD, possibly by interfering with CNS cholesterol homeostasis.",

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics\nWe report here on the detection of nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near to the NOTCH4 locus in the search for schizophrenia susceptibility genes in the class III region of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We totally analyzed 122 family trios recruited in the UK. The TDT analysis demonstrated that of the nine SNPs, three were associated with schizophrenia, including rs1009382 (P = 0.00047), rs204887 (P = 0.007), and rs8283 (P = 0.015). Both rs1009382 and rs204887 are present in the TNXB locus. The rs1009382 is a non-synonymous SNP located in exon 23 of the gene and its A to G base change causes a Glu2578Gly substitution. The goodness-of-fit test showed that genotypic distribution of rs1009382 was deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to homozygote excess in the patient group (P = 0.01), suggesting that a double dose of a genetic risk may be involved. Possibly, rs1009382 is a candidate SNP predisposing to a schizophrenic illness. Moreover, the test for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between paired SNPs showed that the nine SNPs studied may be in the same LD block with an unexpected pattern as the strength of LD was not correlated with the distance between paired SNPs. The haplotype analysis suggested that there might be more than one disease-related allele located in the class III region of the MHC, and that these alleles possibly confer either susceptibility or resistance to schizophrenia.",

                "text": "American journal of human genetics\nSeveral rare mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (MC4R) predispose to obesity. For the most common missense variant V103I (rs2229616), however, the previously reported similar carrier frequencies in obese and nonobese individuals are in line with in vitro studies, which have not shown a functional implication of this variant. In the present study, we initially performed a transmission/disequilibrium test on 520 trios with obesity, and we observed a lower transmission rate of the I103 allele (P=.017), which was an unexpected finding. Therefore, we initiated two large case-control studies (N=2,334 and N=661) and combined the data with those from 12 published studies, for a total of 7,713 individuals. The resulting meta-analysis provides evidence for a negative association of the I103 allele with obesity (odds ratio 0.69; 95% confidence interval 0.50-0.96; P=.03), mainly comprising samples of European origin. Additional screening of four other ethnic groups showed comparable I103 carrier frequencies well below 10%. Genomic sequencing of the MC4R gene revealed three polymorphisms in the noncoding region that displayed strong linkage disequilibrium with V103I. In our functional in vitro assays, the variant was indistinguishable from the wild-type allele, as was the result in previous studies. This report on an SNP/haplotype that is negatively associated with obesity expands the successful application of meta-analysis of modest effects in common diseases to a variant with a carrier frequency well below 10%. The respective protective effect against obesity implies that variation in the MC4R gene entails both loss and gain of function.",

Thus, genetic variability at the HSL locus (LIPE) may play a significant role on lipid metabolism and the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we have examined two LIPE single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [14672C>G in the promoter region and 17948C>T (rs1206034) on intron 2] in relation to plasma lipids, anthropometrical and glucose-related phenotypes in a population of mostly overweight and obese men (373) and women (361). In women, the 17948T allele was associated with decreased total cholesterol (TC, p = 0.001), LDL-cholesterol (LDLc, p < 0.001) and apoE concentrations (p = 0.041). Conversely, female carriers of the LIPE 14672G allele had significantly higher TC (p = 0.047), LDLc (p = 0.041), and apoE (p = 0.041) levels. Although we did not find significant associations in men, we observed that male carriers of the LIPE 14672G who did not drink alcohol showed higher glucose levels than non-carriers (p = 0.008), whereas there were no allele-related differences among drinkers (p = 0.019 for the interaction). These SNPs were not significantly associated with anthropometrical variables. In summary, variation at this locus showed gender-specific associations with lipids and glucose measures, and the latter was influenced by alcohol drinking.",

                "text": "Molecular psychiatry\nA recent study found, in a large sample of Ashkenazi Jews, a highly significant association between schizophrenia and a particular haplotype of three polymorphic sites in the catechol-O-methyl transferase, COMT, gene: an IVS 1 SNP (dbSNP rs737865), the exon 4 functional SNP (Val158Met, dbSNP rs165688), and a downstream SNP (dbSNP rs165599). Subsequently, this haplotype was shown to be associated with lower levels of COMT cDNA derived from normal cortical brain tissue, most likely due to cis-acting element(s). As a first step toward evaluating whether this haplotype may be relevant to schizophrenia in populations other than Ashkenazi Jews, we have studied this haplotype in 38 populations representing all major regions of the world. Adding to our previous data on four polymorphic sites in the COMT gene, including the Val158Met polymorphism, we have typed the IVS 1 rs737865 and 3' rs615599 sites and also included a novel IVS 1 indel polymorphism, yielding seven-site haplotype frequencies for normal individuals in the 38 globally distributed populations, including a sample of Ashkenazi Jews. We report that the schizophrenia-associated haplotype is significantly heterogeneous in populations worldwide. The three-site, schizophrenia-associated haplotype frequencies range from 0% in South America to 37.1% in Southwest Asia, despite the fact that schizophrenia occurs at roughly equal frequency around the world. Assuming that the published associations found between the exon 4 Val158Met SNP and schizophrenia are due to linkage disequilibrium, these new haplotype data support the hypothesis of a relevant cis variant linked to the rs737865 site, possibly just upstream in the P2 promoter driving transcription of the predominant form of COMT in the brain. The previously described HindIII restriction site polymorphism, located within the P2 promoter, varies within all populations and may provide essential information in future studies of schizophrenia.",

This protein inhibits Wnt/beta-catenin mediated transcriptional activation by competing with Lef-1 (the transcription factor and target of beta-catenin) to bind to beta-catenin. This suggests that Chibby could be a tumour suppressor protein. The C22orf2 gene coding Chibby is located on chromosome 22, a region recurrently lost in colorectal cancer. Activation of the Wnt pathway is a major feature of colorectal cancer and occurs through inactivation of APC or activation of beta-catenin.

In this study, 1873 Caucasian subjects from 405 nuclear families containing 1512 sib pairs were recruited. BMD at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning from exon 1 to 8 in the ER-alpha gene were genotyped. The program QTDT (quantitative transmission disequilibrium test) was applied to test linkage and/or association of the ER-alpha gene and BMD variation using individual SNP markers and reconstructed haplotypes. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was generally detected for SNPs in the ER-a gene (P < 0.05). Associations were observed between SNP rs932477 and FN BMD (P = 0.028), and between the most predominant three-marker haplotype (GCG) containing SNP rs932477 and FN BMD (P = 0.010). Within-family association (present only with both linkage and association) between SNP rs2228480 (G2014A) and FN BMD (P = 0.015) was observed. The most predominant seven-SNP haplotype (TCGCGGG) was associated with higher LS BMD (P = 0.015).

                "text": "American journal of human genetics\nCatechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a key enzyme in the elimination of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex of the human brain. Genetic variation in the COMT gene (MIM 116790) has been associated with altered prefrontal cortex function and higher risk for schizophrenia, but the specific alleles and their functional implications have been controversial. We analyzed the effects of several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within COMT on mRNA expression levels (using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis), protein levels (using Western blot analysis), and enzyme activity (using catechol methylation) in a large sample (n = 108) of postmortem human prefrontal cortex tissue, which predominantly expresses the -membrane-bound isoform. A common coding SNP, Val158Met (rs4680), significantly affected protein abundance and enzyme activity but not mRNA expression levels, suggesting that differences in protein integrity account for the difference in enzyme activity between alleles. A SNP in intron 1 (rs737865) and a SNP in the 3' flanking region (rs165599)--both of which have been reported to contribute to allelic expression differences and to be associated with schizophrenia as part of a haplotype with Val--had no effect on mRNA expression levels, protein immunoreactivity, or enzyme activity. In lymphocytes from 47 subjects, we confirmed a similar effect on enzyme activity in samples with the Val/Met genotype but no effect in samples with the intron 1 or 3' SNPs. Separate analyses revealed that the subject's sex, as well as the presence of a SNP in the P2 promoter region (rs2097603), had small effects on COMT enzyme activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis of mouse COMT cDNA, followed by in vitro translation, we found that the conversion of Leu at the homologous position into Met or Val progressively and significantly diminished enzyme activity. Thus, although we cannot exclude a more complex genetic basis for functional effects of COMT, Val is a predominant factor that determines higher COMT activity in the prefrontal cortex, which presumably leads to lower synaptic dopamine levels and relatively deleterious prefrontal function.",

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics\nSeveral lines of evidence indicate an involvement of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in body weight regulation and activity: heterozygous Bdnf knockout mice (Bdnf(+/-)) are hyperphagic, obese, and hyperactive; furthermore, central infusion of BDNF leads to severe, dose-dependent appetite suppression and weight loss in rats. We searched for the role of BDNF variants in obesity, eating disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A mutation screen (SSCP and DHPLC) of the translated region of BDNF in 183 extremely obese children and adolescents and 187 underweight students was performed. Additionally, we genotyped two common polymorphisms (rs6265: p.V66M; c.-46C > T) in 118 patients with anorexia nervosa, 80 patients with bulimia nervosa, 88 patients with ADHD, and 96 normal weight controls. Three rare variants (c.5C > T: p.T2I; c.273G > A; c.*137A > G) and the known polymorphism (p.V66M) were identified. A role of the I2 allele in the etiology of obesity cannot be excluded.

In order to investigate possible causes and mechanisms of lung cancer susceptibility differences, the TP53 gene was sequenced in a case-only study of lung cancers (206 men and 103 women). Our primary hypothesis was that the TP53 mutation spectrum is influenced by polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis. We observed a TP53 mutation frequency in exons 5-8 of 25%. Functional polymorphisms in XPD (Asp312Asn, rs1799793 and Lys751Gln, rs1052559), a protein required for nucleotide excision repair and with roles in p53-mediated apoptosis, were modestly associated with G:C-->T:A mutations in TP53 in lung tumors [Asp/Asn312 + Asn/Asn312 and/or Lys/Gln751 + Gln/Gln751 versus Asp/Asp312 + Lys/Lys751; odds ratio (OR) 2.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-7.61], consistent with the role of this protein in repair of bulky carcinogen-DNA adducts. In addition, a TP53 polymorphism (Arg72Pro, rs1042522) with a known role in the efficiency of apoptosis was also associated with the presence of a TP53 mutation (Pro/Arg72 or Pro/Pro72 versus Arg/Arg72; OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.21-4.17) or a G:C-->T:A mutation in TP53 (Pro/Arg72 or Pro/Pro72 versus Arg/Arg72; OR 2.42, 95% CI 0.97-6.04). An interaction between the XPD variant alleles (Asn312 and Gln751) and the TP53 Pro72 allele was observed for TP53 mutations (any TP53 mutation P(int) = 0.027, G:C-->T:A TP53 mutation P(int) = 0.041). The statistical interaction observed in our study is consistent with the observed biological interaction for XPD and p53 in nucleotide excision repair and apoptosis. In conclusion, differences in TP53 mutation spectra in lung tumors are associated with several genetic factors and may reflect differences in lung cancer susceptibility and carcinogenesis.",

The PLAU gene within this region encodes urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which converts plasminogen to plasmin. Abeta aggregates induce PLAU expression thereby increasing plasmin, which degrades both aggregated and non-aggregated forms of Abeta. We evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PLAU for association with Abeta42 and LOAD. PLAU SNP compound genotypes composed of haplotype pairs showed significant association with AD in three independent case-control series. PLAU SNP haplotypes associated significantly with plasma Abeta42 in 10 extended LOAD families. One of the SNPs analyzed was a missense C/T polymorphism in exon 6 of PLAU (PLAU_1=rs2227564), which causes a proline to leucine change (P141L). We analyzed PLAU_1 for association with AD in six case-control series and 24 extended LOAD families. The CT and TT PLAU_1 genotypes showed association (P=0.05) with an overall estimated odds ratio of 1.2 (1.0-1.5). The CT and TT genotypes of PLAU_1 were also associated with significant age-dependent elevation of plasma Abeta42 in 24 extended LOAD families (P=0.0006). In knockout mice lacking the PLAU gene, plasma--but not brain--Abeta42 as well as Abeta40 was significantly elevated, also in an age-dependent manner. The PLAU_1 associations were independent of the associations we found among plasma Abeta42, LOAD and variants in the IDE or VR22 region. These results provide strong evidence that PLAU or a nearby gene is involved in the development of LOAD. PLAU_1 is a plausible pathogenic mutation that could act by increasing Abeta42, but additional biological experiments are required to show this definitively.",

A coding polymorphism of the COMT gene at codon 108/158 (soluble/membrane-bound form) causing a valine to methionine substitution has been shown to influence enzyme activity, but its association with schizophrenia is inconclusive. We have screened 17 known polymorphisms of the COMT gene in 320 Korean schizophrenic patients and 379 controls to determine whether there is a positive association with a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs6267) at codon 22/72 (soluble/membrane-bound form) causing an alanine-to-serine (Ala/Ser) substitution. With the Ala/Ala genotype as a reference group, the combined genotype (Ala/Ser and Ser/Ser)-specific adjusted odds ratio was 1.82 (95% CI = 1.19-2.76; P = 0.005), suggesting the Ser allele as a risk allele for schizophrenia. However, the Val/Met polymorphism was not associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in Koreans (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.64-1.21; P = 0.43).

Stratified analyses revealed that the AORs for the 8092C > A polymorphism (A/A versus C/C) decreased significantly as pack-years increased, with the AOR of 2.11 (95% CI, 1.03-4.31) in never smokers and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.25-1.01) in heavy smokers (>/=56 pack-years), respectively. Consistent results were found when gene-smoking interaction was incorporated by joint effects and interactions models that considered both discrete and continuous variables for cumulative smoking exposure. The same direction for the gene-smoking interaction was found for the 19007T > C polymorphism, although the interaction was not statistically significant. In conclusion, ERCC1 8092C > A polymorphism may modify the associations between cumulative cigarette smoking and lung cancer risk.",

The influence of rare gene variants on repolarization is evident in familial long QT syndrome. To investigate the influence of common gene variants on the QT interval we performed a linkage disequilibrium based SNP association study of four candidate genes. Using a two-step design we analyzed 174 SNPs from the KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, and KCNE2 genes in 689 individuals from the population-based KORA study and 14 SNPs with results suggestive of association in a confirmatory sample of 3277 individuals from the same survey. We detected association to a gene variant in intron 1 of the KCNQ1 gene (rs757092, +1.7 ms/allele, P=0.0002) and observed weaker association to a variant upstream of the KCNE1 gene (rs727957, +1.2 ms/allele, P=0.0051). In addition we detected association to two SNPs in the KCNH2 gene, the previously described K897T variant (rs1805123, -1.9 ms/allele, P=0.0006) and a gene variant that tags a different haplotype in the same block (rs3815459, +1.7 ms/allele, P=0.0004). The analysis of additive effects by an allelic score explained a 10.5 ms difference in corrected QT interval length between extreme score groups and 0.951 of trait variance (P<0.00005). These results confirm previous heritability studies indicating that repolarization is a complex trait with a significant heritable component and demonstrate that high-resolution SNP-mapping in large population samples can detect and fine map quantitative trait loci even if locus specific heritabilities are small.",

Two polymorphisms of the p21 gene at codon 31 (p21 C98A, dbSNP rs1801270) and at the 3' untranslated region (p21 T70C, dbSNP rs1059234) may have an effect on the protein function and may thus play a role in the development of cancer. We hypothesized that these two p21 polymorphisms are associated with the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). We tested this hypothesis in a hospital-based case-control study of 712 patients newly diagnosed with SCCHN and 1222 cancer-free controls who were frequency-matched by age, sex and ethnicity. All subjects were non-Hispanic whites. Our results showed that the variant alleles and genotypes were more common among cases than among controls (P < 0.001 and P = 0.013 for p21C70T, and P < 0.001 and P = 0.035 for p21C98A, respectively). Compared with the p21 70CC genotype, there was a significantly greater risk of SCCHN associated with the variant p21 70TC [odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12-1.93] and combined p21 70TC/TT (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.14-1.95) genotypes. Similarly, compared with the p21 98CC genotype, there was also a significantly greater SCCHN risk associated with the variant p21 98AC (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.00-1.73) and combined p21 98AC/AA (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.05-1.79) genotypes. When these two polymorphisms were evaluated together by the number of risk alleles, there was a significant increase in SCCHN risk that was dependent on the number of risk alleles (P(trend) = 0.001). Our results suggest that the presence of these two p21 polymorphisms may be a marker of genetic susceptibility to SCCHN.",

A three-SNP haplotype [hCV219779 (C)-rs821597 (G)-rs821616 (A)] spanning 83 kb of the gene was associated with schizophrenia in a family-based sample (P = 0.002). A common nonconservative SNP (Ser704Cys) (rs821616) within this haplotype was associated with schizophrenia (P = 0.004). Based on primary expression of DISC1 in hippocampus, we hypothesized that allelic variation at Ser704Cys would have a measurable impact on hippocampal structure and function as assayed via specific hippocampus-related intermediate phenotypes. In addition to overtransmission in schizophrenia, the Ser allele was associated with altered hippocampal structure and function in healthy subjects, including reduced hippocampal gray matter volume and altered engagement of the hippocampus during several cognitive tasks assayed with functional magnetic resonance imaging. These convergent data suggest that allelic variation within DISC1, either at Ser704Cys or haplotypes monitored by it, increases the risk for schizophrenia and that the mechanism of this effect involves structural and functional alterations in the hippocampal formation.",

A functional variant in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, the Val158Met ('val/met') polymorphism, has been associated in some prior studies with several phenotypes, including neuroticism. We tested the hypothesis that the val158met polymorphism would be associated with both high neuroticism and low extraversion, making it a plausible candidate locus for anxiety susceptibility. To determine whether val158met is responsible for these effects, we also evaluated the association with haplotypes that included two other SNPs within the COMT gene. We collected a sample of 497 undergraduate college students who were phenotyped on a personality inventory (the NEO-Personality Inventory-Raised (NEO-PI-R)). Subjects were genotyped for three COMT polymorphisms: the well-studied nonsynonymous SNP rs4680 that generates a valine-to-methionine substitution (val158met), rs737865 (near exon #1), and rs165599 (also functional, near the 3'-UTR). Together, these three SNPs define a haplotype that is associated with reduced COMT expression in human brain. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the effects of individual SNPs on extraversion and neuroticism scores. Score tests for association between these traits (quantitatively and dichotomously considered) and haplotypes were also conducted. We evaluated potential for population stratification artifact by genotyping a set of 36 unlinked highly polymorphic markers previously demonstrated to distinguish sufficiently ancestry of major American populations. Two of the SNPs (rs4680 ('val/met') and rs737865) were significantly associated with (low) extraversion and, less consistently, with (high) neuroticism, with effects confined to women. A significant association between COMT haplotype and (low) extraversion and (high) neuroticism was also observed. Formal testing showed that population structure did not explain the findings. These data suggest that involvement of the COMT locus in susceptibility to anxiety-related traits (ie low extraversion and high neuroticism) is unlikely to be wholly accounted for by the well-studied rs4680 ('val/met') polymorphism. Other functional variants may exist that contribute to this relationship. Possible sex-specific effects remain to be further studied and explained.",

Reactive oxygen species produced during normal aerobic metabolism damage cellular macromolecules. The brain is particularly susceptible to oxidative stress due to its high rate of aerobic metabolism. We hypothesised that polymorphisms in genes contributing to antioxidant defences are associated with variation in normal cognitive ageing in the absence of dementia. We examined associations between two SNPs (rs2073495 and rs743658) in Lactotransferrin (LTF), a gene involved in iron absorption, and the common M129V SNP in the prion protein gene, PRNP (rs1799990), with cognitive ability and cognitive ageing in a cohort of non-demented individuals born in 1921. All had cognitive ability measured at age 11 in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1932, and again at age 79. No association was identified with LTF. PRNP M129V was significantly related to Moray House Test (MHT) IQ scores at age 79, adjusted for sex and age 11 IQ (p=0.006). Individuals homozygous for the methionine allele performed significantly better than heterozygotes. This study supports the hypothesis that genetic variations in antioxidant defence genes, specifically PRNP, are important influences on the trajectory of normal cognitive ageing. An interaction between PRNP and klotho (KL) genotypes was also identified (p=0.015), highlighting the importance of analysing gene interactions when investigating associations with quantitative traits.",

We analyzed four coding polymorphisms of the PAX4 gene in 498 cases with type 1 diabetes and 825 control subjects from Finland and Hungary. All patients were diagnosed under the age of 15 years according to the World Health Organization criteria. All four PAX4 variants (three in exon 9 and one in exon 3) were genotyped using DNA sequencing. In addition, all Finnish subjects were typed for HLA DR-DQ, insulin gene (-23) HphI, and CTLA4 CT60 polymorphisms. The +1,168 C/A coding variant of PAX4 was found to be polymorphic in both populations (P321H, rs712701). No difference was observed in the genotype frequencies between cases and control subjects, nor was any disease association detected when patients were stratified according to age at diagnosis, sex, HLA, insulin gene, or CTLA4 genotypes. Our data indicate that the +1,168 C/A variant of PAX4 gene does not play any essential role in genetic type 1 diabetes susceptibility.

To fine map this locus we carried out tests of allelic association using 30 genetic markers near the telomere at 21q22.3 in 600 bipolar research subjects and 450 ancestrally matched supernormal control subjects. We found significant allelic association with the microsatellite markers D21S171 (P=0.016) and two closely linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs1556314 (P=0.008) and rs1785467 (P=0.025). A test of association with a three locus haplotype across the susceptibility region was significant with a permutation test of P=0.011. A two SNP haplotype was also significantly associated with bipolar disorder (P=0.01). Only two brain expressed genes, TRPM2 and C21ORF29 (TSPEAR), are present in the associated region. TRPM2 encodes a calcium channel receptor and TSPEAR encodes a peptide with repeats associated with epilepsy in the mouse. DNA from subjects who had inherited the associated marker alleles was sequenced. A base pair change (rs1556314) in exon 11 of TRPM2, which caused a change from an aspartic acid to a glutamic acid at peptide position 543 was found. This SNP showed the strongest association with bipolar disorder (P=0.008). Deletion of exon 11 of TRPM2 is known to cause dysregulation of cellular calcium homeostasis in response to oxidative stress. A second nonconservative change from arginine to cysteine at position 755 in TRPM2 (ss48297761) was also detected. A third nonconservative change from histidine to glutamic acid was found in exon 8 of TSPEAR. These changes need further investigation to establish any aetiological role in bipolar disorder.",

A family history of disease and exposure to estrogen are major risk factors for developing breast cancer. Estrogen exerts its biological effects through binding to the estrogen receptors, estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and the more recently discovered estrogen receptor beta (ESR2). Genetic variation in genes involved in estrogen biosynthesis, metabolism and signal transduction have been suggested to play a role in breast cancer risk. We therefore tested the hypothesis that common genetic variants of the ESR2 gene may be associated with increased risk for breast cancer and this risk may vary between breast cancer groups. We investigated three common ESR2 polymorphisms, rs1256049 (G1082A), rs4986938 (G1730A) and rs928554 (Cx+56 A-->G) for association to breast cancer risk. A total of 723 breast cancer cases and 480 controls were included in the study. Of the breast cancer cases, 323 were sporadic and 400 were familial, the familial cases were further divided into familial high-risk and familial low-risk breast cancer cases. We found no overall statistically significant association for any of the single polymorphisms studied. Haplotype analysis suggested one haplotype associated with increased risk in sporadic breast cancer patients (OR = 3.0, p = 0.03). Further analysis is needed to elucidate the role of estrogen receptor beta in breast cancer susceptibility.",

We used unconditional logistic regression models to examine the association between this SNP and the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in a population-based case-control study of women residing in Connecticut (461 case patients and 535 control subjects). The risk of NHL among women with the CC genotype was more than double that of women with the TT genotype (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5 to 3.3).

We previously reported a reduction of D-serine serum levels in schizophrenia, supporting the disease hypothesis of NMDA receptor-mediated hypo-neurotransmission. The serum levels of D-serine are thought to reflect brain d-serine content. It is important to understand whether there is a direct link between the altered D-serine levels and NMDA receptor expression in vivo or whether these are independent processes. Two polymorphisms are known to regulate the expression of NMDA receptor subunit genes: (GT)(n) (rs3219790) in the promoter region of the NR2A subunit gene (GRIN2A) and -200T > G (rs1019385) in the NR2B gene (GRIN2B). These polymorphisms are also reported to be associated with schizophrenia. Therefore, we examined the correlation between these two polymorphisms and d-serine serum levels in mentally healthy controls, schizophrenics and the combined group. We observed no significant genotype-phenotype correlations in any of the sample groups. However, analyses of larger sample numbers and the detection of additional polymorphisms that affect gene expression are needed before we can conclude that NMDA receptor expression and serum levels of d-serine, if involved in schizophrenia pathophysiology, are independent and additive events.",

MDM2 is a key negative regulator of the TP53 pathway and is overexpressed in many cancers as oncoprotein. We investigated the association between genetic variation in the promoter region of MDM2 (c.-5+309G>T, rs2279744:g.G>T) and the coding region of TP53 (c.215G>C, rs1042522:g.G>C, designated Arg72Pro) and the risk of developing lung cancer. The genotypes of 1,106 patients and 1,420 controls were determined by tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR or PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Associations with risk of lung cancer were estimated by logistic regression. We observed an increased lung cancer risk associated with the MDM2 GG (odds ratio [OR] = 1.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45-2.32) and TG (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.09-1.63) genotypes. An increased risk was also associated with the TP53 Pro/Pro genotype (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.17-1.85, P = 0.003) compared to the Arg/Arg genotype. The gene-gene interaction of MDM2 and TP53 polymorphisms increased lung cancer risk in a supermultiplicative manner (OR for the presence of both MDM2 GG and TP53 Pro/Pro genotypes = 4.56, 95% CI = 2.76-7.54). Significant interactions were observed between these polymorphisms (respectively and jointly) and smoking (OR = 10.41, 95% CI = 5.26-20.58) for smokers with both the MDM2 GG and TP53 Pro/Pro genotypes. In conclusion, genetic polymorphisms in cell cycle regulatory genes MDM2 and TP53 contribute to the risk of developing lung cancer.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of this polymorphism, as well as the well-known -3826A>G polymorphism (rs1800592), on clinical characteristics of type 2 diabetes. We determined the genotypes of the two polymorphisms in 93 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. Intramyocellular lipid content and hepatic lipid content (HLC) were measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. No significant differences in age, sex, BMI, or HbA1c level were detected between type 2 diabetic patients with the -112C allele and those without it. However, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (p=0.0089) and HLC (p=0.012) was significantly greater in patients with the -112C allele. We did not detect an association of the -3826A>G polymorphism (rs1800592) of UCP1 gene with any measured parameters. These results suggest that insulin resistance caused by the -112C allele influences the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.",

Despite the important role of HSD17B1 in hormone metabolism, few epidemiologic studies of HSD17B1 and breast cancer have been conducted. This study includes 5,370 breast cancer cases and 7,480 matched controls from five large cohorts in the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium. We characterized variation in HSD17B1 by resequencing and dense genotyping a multiethnic sample and identified haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNP) that capture common variation within a 33.3-kb region around HSD17B1. Four htSNPs, including the previously studied SNP rs605059 (S312G), were genotyped to tag five common haplotypes in all cases and controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for disease. We found no evidence of association between common HSD17B1 haplotypes or htSNPs and overall risk of breast cancer. The OR for each haplotype relative to the most common haplotype ranged from 0.98 to 1.07 (omnibus test for association: X2 = 3.77, P = 0.58, 5 degrees of freedom). When cases were subdivided by estrogen receptor (ER) status, two common haplotypes were associated with ER-negative tumors (test for trend, Ps = 0.0009 and 0.0076; n = 353 cases). HSD17B1 variants that are common in Caucasians are not associated with overall risk of breast cancer; however, there was an association among the subset of ER-negative tumors. Although the probability that these ER-negative findings are false-positive results is high, these findings were consistent across each cohort examined and warrant further study.",

Here we report an investigation of the association between a BDNF coding variant (Val66Met, rs6265) and mood status in a large non-clinical sample of men and women. We genotyped 7389 adult men and women, aged 41-80 years, selected from participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition in Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk, United Kingdom). Evidence of past year prevalent, lifetime and recurrent episodic major depressive disorder (MDD) and of past year prevalent and lifetime generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), defined by DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, was assessed through questionnaire together with a five-item version of the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). A total of 1214 (16.4%) participants reported lifetime MDD and 355 (4.8%) reported lifetime GAD. In this population based study we found no evidence to support an association between the BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism and mood status.",

In the present study, the potential contribution of SNPs harboured in the fibrinogen, IL6 and F13A1 genes to these biochemical and clinical phenotypes was examined. A database and biobank based on 387 survivors of a first MI and population-based controls were used. Sixty controls were selected according to FGG 9340T > C [rs1049636] genotype for studies on fibrin clot structure using the liquid permeation method. The multifactor dimensionality reduction method was used for interaction analyses. We here report that the FGA 2224G > A [rs2070011] SNP (9.2%), plasma fibrinogen concentration (13.1%) and age (8.1%) appeared as independent determinants of fibrin gel porosity. The FGA 2224G > A SNP modulated the relation between plasma fibrinogen concentration and fibrin clot porosity. The FGG-FGA*4 haplotype, composed of the minor FGG 9340C and FGA 2224A alleles, had similar effects, supporting its reported protective role in relation to MI. Significant epistasis on plasma fibrinogen concentration was detected between the FGA 2224G > A and F13A1 Val34Leu [rs5985] SNPs (p < 0.001). The FGG 9340T > C and FGB 1038G > A [rs1800791] SNPs appeared to interact on MI risk, explaining the association of FGG-FGB haplotypes with MI in the absence of effects of individual SNPs. Thus, epistatic and pleiotropic effects of polymorphisms contribute to the variation in plasma fibrinogen concentration, fibrin clot structure and risk of MI.",

We investigated variations within genes mediating oxidative stress to determine whether they alter risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Thirteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 10 oxidative stress genes (AKR1A1, AKR1C1, CYBA, GPX, MPO, NOS2A, NOS3, OGG1, PPARG and SOD2) were genotyped in 1172 NHL cases and 982 population-based controls from a USA multicenter case-control study. For NHL and five subtypes (diffuse large B-cell, follicular, marginal zone, small lymphocytic and T-cell), SNP associations were calculated. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for sex, age (<45, 45-64, 65+ years), race (white, black, other) and study site. Overall, the oxidative stress pathway was associated significantly with the B-cell NHL subtype, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (global P-value=0.003). Specifically, for nitric oxide synthase (NOS2A Ser608Leu, rs2297518) Leu/Leu homozygotes, there was a 2-fold risk increase for NHL (OR=2.2, 95% CI=1.1-4.4) (referent=Ser/Ser and Ser/Leu). This risk increase was consistent by cell lineage (B- and T-cell NHL) and pronounced for the two most common subtypes, diffuse large B-cell (OR=3.4, 95% CI=1.5-7.8) and follicular lymphoma (OR=2.6, 95% CI=1.0-6.8). In an analysis of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2 Val16Ala, rs1799725) Ala/Ala homozygotes, we observed moderately increased risks for B-cell lymphomas (OR=1.3, 95% CI=1.0-1.6; referent=Val/Val and Val/Ala) that was consistent across the B-cell subtypes. Genetic variations that result in an increased generation of reactive oxygen species appear to increase risk for NHL and its major subtypes, particularly DLBCL. Independent replication of our findings are warranted and further evaluation of oxidative stress in the context of inflammation, DNA repair and the induction of the NF-kappaB pathway may further reveal important clues for lymphomagenesis.",

We used a comprehensive SNP-tagging approach to search for low-penetrance susceptibility alleles in a study of up to 4,647 cases and 4,564 controls, in a two-stage study design. We identified seven tagging SNPs using genotype data from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Environmental Genome Project and typed these, and an additional three SNPs, in 2,345 breast cancer cases and 2,284 controls (set 1). Three SNPs showed no evidence for association and were not studied further, whereas seven SNPs (rs11571171, rs7116336, rs660149, rs10895068, rs500760, rs566351, and rs1042838) exhibited significant associations at P < 0.1 using either a heterogeneity or trend test and progressed to be genotyped in set 2. After both stages, only one SNP was significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer - the PGR-12 (rs1042638) V660L valine to leucine polymorphism [VL heterozygotes (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.24) and the LL homozygotes (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.73), P(het) = 0.008, P(trend) = 0.002]. Similar estimates were obtained in a combined analysis of our data with those from three other published studies. We conclude that the 660L allele may be associated with a moderately increased risk of breast cancer, but that other common SNPs in the PGR gene are unlikely to be associated with a substantial risk of breast cancer.",

Intercellular adhesion molecule-1-deficient mice show impaired lymphocyte recruitment to the lung, less airway hyper-responsiveness and less lung inflammation than healthy controls. Thus, the aim of the study was to test common ICAM1 polymorphisms for association with paediatric asthma. Furthermore, we were interested in whether soluble ICAM1 (sICAM1) serum levels were in correlation with genotypes. The following polymorphisms in ICAM1 were genotyped on 352 children with asthma and 270 controls: rs5491 (resulting in the amino-acid exchange K56M), rs5493 (G241S), rs5498 (K469E), rs5030400 (R478W) and rs885743 in the 3'-untranslated region. In addition, sICAM1 serum levels were measured. Only K469E and rs885743 were present in our populations. K469E showed association with asthma (P = 0.0037 with Armitage's trend test). Haplotype analysis by FAMHAP using both polymorphisms revealed association with asthma by P < 0.000001. In addition, serum sICAM1 levels were correlated with K469E genotypes (P = 0.009 by Kruskal-Wallis test). We conclude from our data that K469KE is associated with paediatric asthma in the German population. Furthermore, the same polymorphism is correlated with serum levels of sICAM1.

We conducted a case-control study of 2691 cases of type 2 diabetes (1692 women and 999 men) and 3237 control subjects (2238 women and 999 men) from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professional Follow-up Study.

We did not find significant associations between IL6 polymorphisms and the risk of type 2 diabetes in women or men, individually or in haplotypes. In addition, none of the IL6 polymorphisms was significantly associated with the plasma levels of IL-6 in the control subjects. Our meta-analysis of 5383 diabetes case and 12 069 controls indicated a null association between the best-studied 5' promoter polymorphism--174G>C (rs1800795)--and diabetes risk. Diversity in adiposity, age and sex could not account for the heterogeneity across different studies.

Recently, we reported a SNP (rs3213245, -77T>C) in the XRCC1 gene 5' untranslated region (UTR) was significantly associated with the risk of developing esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. Computer analysis predicted that this SNP was in the core of Sp1-binding motif, which suggested its functional significance. Gel shift and super shift assays confirmed that -77T>C polymorphic site in the XRCC1 promoter was within the Sp1-binding motif and the T>C substitution greatly enhanced the binding affinity of Sp1 to this region. Luciferase assays indicated that the Sp1-high-affinity C-allelic XRCC1 promoter was associated with a reduced transcriptional activity. The association between -77T>C and three other amino-acid substitution-causing polymorphisms in XRCC1 and risk of lung cancer was examined in 1024 patients and 1118 controls and the results showed that only the -77T>C polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that an increased risk of lung cancer was associated with the variant XRCC1 -77 genotypes (TC and CC) compared with the TT genotype (OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.18-1.82; P=0.001) and the increased risk was more pronounced in smokers (OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.20-2.21) than in non-smokers (OR=1.28, 95% CI=0.94-1.76). Taken together, these results showed that the functional SNP -77T>C in XRCC1 5'UTR was associated with cancer development owing to the decreased transcriptional activity of C-allele-containing promoter with higher affinity to Sp1 binding.",

Association studies with microsatellite markers using a case/control sample from the same population (n = 427) revealed significant allelic associations between the bipolar phenotype and marker NBG6. Since this marker is located in intron 9 of the P2RX7 gene, we analyzed the surrounding genomic region for the presence of polymorphisms in regulatory, coding and intron/exon junction sequences. Twenty four (24) SNPs were genotyped in a case/control sample and 12 SNPs in all pedigrees used for linkage analysis. Allelic, genotypic or family-based association studies suggest the presence of two susceptibility loci, the P2RX7 and CaMKK2 genes. The strongest association was observed in bipolar families at the non-synonymous SNP P2RX7-E13A (rs2230912, P-value = 0.000708), which results from an over-transmission of the mutant G-allele to affected offspring. This Gln460Arg polymorphism occurs at an amino acid that is conserved between humans and rodents and is located in the C-terminal domain of the P2X7 receptor, known to be essential for normal P2RX7 function.",

In Caucasian, a polymorphism of the complement factor H gene (CFH), the C allele of rs1061170 (Y402H), was established as the first strong genetic factor for excursively exudative type of ARMD. In this study, we performed an extensive sequencing of the 22 exons in the CFH gene by recruiting 146 exudative ARMD patients and 105 normal controls of Japanese origin and identified 61 polymorphisms. We found that the frequency of the C allele of rs1061170 (Y402H) is much lower (0.04) in Japanese controls than in Caucasians (0.45). No case disease susceptibility to exudative ARMD was noted for rs1061170 (Y402H) (chi (2) = 3.19, P (corr) = 0.423), or other 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) whose frequency is greater than 0.05. When haplotypes were inferred for 13 SNPs (these 12 SNPs with a frequency greater than 0.05 and rs1061170), three haplotypes whose pattern was similar to those in Caucasians were identified but with substantial difference in frequency. Again we failed to identify genetic association between Japanese exudative ARMD and any of the haplotypes including the J1 haplotype which was shown to be susceptible to ARMD in Caucasians (chi (2 )=( )3.92, P (corr) = 0.157). CFH does not appear to be a primary hereditary contributor to ARMD in Japanese. The absence of CFH contribution to ARMD in Japanese may correlate with the findings in ethnic differences of ARMD phenotypes.",

Two variations of PPARG (P12A[rs1801282] and C161T [rs3856806]) were investigated in two independent case-control studies with a total of 832 melanoma patients and 790 control individuals. In the first study, homozygous carriers of the rare *T allele of the C161T polymorphism in exon 6 of PPARG were significantly more common among patients with melanoma than among healthy subjects (6.0 vs. 2.0%; P=0.0096) and this association was independent of clinical risk factors such as skin type and nevus count (odds ratio 5.18; 95% confidence interval 1.68-15.96; P=0.0041). This finding, however, could not be replicated in the second case-control study. We therefore conclude that the investigated PPARG polymorphisms are not likely to constitute a significant risk factor for the development of melanoma among German Caucasians.",

Increasing evidence highlights a potential role for cholesterol in the pathophysiology of AD. The ABCA1 gene, located in close vicinity to the 9q linkage peaks identified by genome-wide AD linkage studies, plays an important role in cellular cholesterol efflux, and is likely a good candidate gene. However, results from published genetic association studies between ABCA1 and AD are ambiguous. In the present study, we examined the role of two ABCA1 polymorphisms, R219K (rs2230806) and G-17C (rs2740483) in modifying the risk of late-onset AD (LOAD) in a large American white cohort of 992 AD cases and 699 controls. We observed significant gender x R219K interaction (p=0.00008). Female carriers of the 219K allele showed a 1.75-fold increased risk of developing AD compared to non-219K carrier females (95% CI 1.34-2.29; p=0.00004). The overall two-site haplotype distribution was also significant between female AD cases and controls (p=0.017). The risk associated with the R219K polymorphism was independent of the recently reported significant association in the ubiquilin (UBQLN1) gene in this region on chromosome 9q. Our data suggest a gender-specific and APOE and UBQLN1 independent association between the ABCA1/R219K polymorphism and LOAD.",

An ICAM gene cluster lying within a 26 kb region on chromosome 19p13.2, and containing ICAM1, ICAM4, and ICAM5 has recently been identified as harboring a breast and prostate cancer susceptibility locus in two populations of European ancestry from Germany and Australia. The objective of this study was to confirm the ICAM association with prostate cancer in a sample of African American prostate cancer cases (N = 286) and controls (N = 391). Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the three ICAM genes were genotyped. To control for potential population stratification an ancestry-adjusted association analysis was performed. We found that ICAM1 SNPs, -9A/C (rs5490) and K469E (rs5498) were associated with prostate cancer risk in men with a family history of prostate cancer (P = 0.008). Specifically, increased risk was observed for individuals who possessed the CC genotype of the -9 A/C variant (odds ratio = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.0-6.3) and at least one G allele of non-synonymous K469E variant (odds ratio = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.2-3.1). Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed across the ICAM region (P < 0.001). A common haplotype within the ICAM gene cluster, harboring the -9A/C variant was significantly associated with prostate cancer (P = 0.03), mainly due to men with family history (P = 0.01). Our results replicate previous findings of association of the ICAM gene cluster with prostate cancer and suggest that common genetic variation within ICAM1 and not ICAM5 may be an important risk factor for prostate cancer.",

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics\nRecent reports have implicated polymorphisms in the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene region in the etiology of several psychiatric phenotypes, including bipolar disorder. Significant disease association has been reported for the G allele at SNP rs6265, which encodes for Valine at position 66 of BDNF (Val66Met), an apparently functional variant of this key BDNF. Here we examined a sample of 224 bipolar type I patients and available parents (comprising a total of 212 nuclear families) ascertained in a South American population isolate (Antioquia, Colombia). We tested for transmission distortion to bipolar patients of alleles at the rs6265 polymorphism and at a microsatellite marker 1.3 kb away from this SNP. Significant excess transmission of the rs6265 G allele to cases was observed (chi(2) = 10.77, d.f. = 1, P = 0.001). Two-locus haplotype analysis showed a significant global transmission distortion (chi(2) = 16.059, d.f. = 7, P = 0.025) with an excess transmission of a haplotype comprising the rs6265 G allele and microsatellite allele 227. These results are consistent with previous studies pointing to a role for BDNF in susceptibility to mood disorders.",

Several potentially functional variants in the gene have been identified, but considerable controversy exists regarding the contribution of individual alleles and haplotypes to risk for schizophrenia, partly because clinical phenotypes are ill-defined and preclinical studies are limited by lack of adequate models. Here, we propose a neuroimaging approach to overcome these limitations by characterizing the functional impact of ambiguous haplotypes on a neural system-level intermediate phenotype in humans. Studying 126 healthy control subjects during a working-memory paradigm, we find that a previously described risk variant in a functional Val158Met (rs4680) polymorphism interacts with a P2 promoter region SNP (rs2097603) and an SNP in the 3' region (rs165599) in predicting inefficient prefrontal working memory response. We report evidence that the nonlinear response of prefrontal neurons to dopaminergic stimulation is a neural mechanism underlying these nonadditive genetic effects. This work provides an in vivo approach to functional validation in brain of the biological impact of complex genetic variations within a gene that may be critical for its clinical association.",

It is characterized by excessive cutaneous and visceral fibrosis, damage to small blood vessels, and production of autoantibodies. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) has been shown to be involved in abnormal fibrosis in other diseases. Therefore, we have evaluated its possible involvement in SSc. We analyzed four IL13 gene polymorphisms, rs1800925 (IL13-1055), rs20541 (Arg130Gln), rs847, and rs2243204 in 107 unrelated SSc patients (40 patients having diffuse cutaneous form and 67 patients having limited cutaneous form) and in 170 controls. All subjects were Caucasians. In the total patient population and in the diffuse cutaneous subset, we observed an association between two IL13 polymorphisms, IL13 rs1800925 (IL13-1055), and IL13 rs2243204, and disease (p=0.03-0.04). The IL13 rs2243204T allele was more common in SSc patients (p=0.01, OR=2.3 CI 1.21-4.38) and in the diffuse cutaneous form (p=0.01, OR=2.95, CI 1.35-6.49) than in control subjects. Our result supports the suggestion that polymorphisms in IL13 are associated to SSc and skin fibrosis process. However, further studies on larger and independent population and functional analyses are needed to confirm these findings.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that the c.1204T>C, p.Tyr402His allelic variant in the complement factor H (CFH) gene is associated with an approximately three-fold increased risk for AMD in Caucasians of predominantly European descent. Both the prevalence as well as the phenotypic spectrum of AMD varies widely among persons of different ethnicities. We hypothesized that populations with a lower prevalence of AMD might also have a lower prevalence of the CFH risk allele. In this study we sought to determine the frequency of this sequence variant in control populations of Caucasians, African Americans, Hispanics, Somalis, and Japanese. Normal control populations were assembled for each ethnic group: Caucasian (n=148), Somali (n=128), African American (n=75), Hispanic (n=81), and Japanese (n=82). Individuals were genotyped using a restriction digest assay and the frequency of the C allele at nucleotide position 1204 of the CFH gene was determined. A bioinformatic approach was used to identify SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with rs1061170 (c.1204T>C, p.Tyr402His) from the human haplotype map project database (HapMap) in order to validate the findings. We found widely discordant frequencies of the risk allele between some of the different ethnic groups: Japanese 0.07+/-0.02, Hispanics 0.17+/-0.03, African-Americans 0.35+/-0.04, Caucasians 0.34+/-0.03, and Somalis 0.34+/-0.03. Allele frequencies generated by analysis of the HapMap database were consistent with these findings. This study suggests that there are other yet unidentified genetic factors important in the pathogenesis of AMD that may mitigate the effects of c.1204T>C, p.Tyr402His variant.",

Here we report the results of a case-control study to identify disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these loci. In the initial phase of our study, we genotyped two putative functional SNPs in ubiquitin-specific protease 24 (USP24), a biological candidate gene within the chromosome 1 linkage region, and scanned the chromosome 2 linkage peak with 43 SNPs in a sample set of 224 PD cases and 186 matched controls. Both USP24 SNPs were significantly associated with disease risk (p = 0.0037 for rs1165222:T > C, p.Thr195ILe, and p = 0.037 for rs13312:C > G, a SNP in the 3'-untranslated region), and one marker, rs1048603:C > T, p.Arg1123Cys, in USP40 was significant from the chromosome 2 scan (p = 0.038). Further genotyping of the region surrounding these initial markers led us to identify 19 additional SNPs with strong disease association. In the second phase, we genotyped the 22 significant markers in an additional 110 cases and 162 controls, which together with part of the initial sample set (201 cases and 149 controls) constitute an expanded sample set of 311 age- and gender-matched case-control pairs. Twenty-one markers were significant in the expanded sample set (most significant allelic p-value: 0.0006 for rs287235:C > G on chromosome 1, and 0.005 for rs838552:T > C on chromosome 2), and six SNPs in USP24 remained significant after conservatively adjusting for testing 27 markers (pBonferroni = 0.017-0.049). It is unlikely that population stratification contributed to this finding, as population stratification was undetectable in our sample set using 78 null markers. Our data suggest that genetic variants in USP24 and USP40 affect the risk for late-onset PD, which is consistent with the predicted role of the ubiquitination pathway in PD etiology.",

However, these mutations are rare in the general population, and account for little of the incidence of sporadic breast cancer in the general population. Therefore, research has been focused on examining associations between common polymorphisms and breast cancer risk. To date, few associations have been described. This has led to the hypothesis that breast cancer is a complex disease, whereby a constellation of very low penetrance alleles need to be carried to present a risk phenotype. Polymorphisms in the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX-1) genes have been proposed as low penetrance alleles, and have not been clearly associated with breast cancer. We investigated whether variants at both polymorphisms, while not independently associated with breast cancer risk, could influence breast cancer risk when considered together.",

We tested this hypothesis by genotyping a SNP known to alter BDNF function (rs6265, also termed Val66Met) and a SNP associated with Alzheimer disease (BDNF C270T), along with two BDNF intronic SNPs (rs7103411, rs11030104), in 228 cases with extreme young onset and 329 cases with extreme old onset of HD. No differences were seen between groups for allele frequencies or genotype frequencies for any SNP. Furthermore, no association to onset age was seen in GEE models controlling for HD repeat size or in haplotype analyses of these SNPs. These results indicate that BDNF does not influence significantly the mechanisms in HD pathogenesis that lead to neurologic onset.",

BPD affects about 1%-2% of the general population and has a high mortality rate as a result of suicide and impulsive behaviour. The serotonin 2A receptor gene (HTR2A) is considered a candidate gene for BPD because multiple lines of evidence suggest that it plays an important role in suicide, impulsivity and emotional liability. To test for an association between HTR2A and BPD, we genotyped four polymorphisms, rs6313 (T102C), rs4941573, rs2296972 and rs6314 (His452Tyr), in 111 Caucasian patients with BPD and 287 Caucasian healthy controls. The program UNPHASED was used to compare allele and haplotype frequencies between cases and controls. We did not find a significant association between HTR2A and BPD based on allele, genotype or haplotype analyses. However, there were significant associations between HTR2A and personality traits in the BPD patients. The C allele of rs6313 and the A allele of rs4941573 associated with a higher Extraversion score. Our results suggest that the serotonin 2A receptor gene may not play a major role in the aetiology of borderline personality disorder, but may have a role in personality traits.",

COMT also has been shown to influence prefrontal cortex processing efficiency. Prefrontal processing dysfunction is a common finding in schizophrenia, and a background of inefficient processing may modulate the effect of other candidate genes. Using the NIMH sibling study (SS), a non-independent case-control set, and an independent German (G) case-control set, we performed conditional/unconditional logistic regression to test for epistasis between SNPs in COMT (rs2097603, Val158Met (rs4680), rs165599) and polymorphisms in other schizophrenia susceptibility genes. Evidence for interaction was evaluated using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) between nested models. SNPs in RGS4, G72, GRM3, and DISC1 showed evidence for significant statistical epistasis with COMT. A striking result was found in RGS4: three of five SNPs showed a significant increase in risk [LRT P-values: 90387 = 0.05 (SS); SNP4 = 0.02 (SS), 0.02 (G); SNP18 = 0.04 (SS), 0.008 (G)] in interaction with COMT; main effects for RGS4 SNPs were null. Significant results for SNP4 and SNP18 were also found in the German study. We were able to detect statistical interaction between COMT and polymorphisms in candidate genes for schizophrenia, many of which had no significant main effect. In addition, we were able to replicate other studies, including allelic directionality. The use of epistatic models may improve replication of psychiatric candidate gene studies.",

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics\nSynaptic actions of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) have been implicated in many facets of ethanol's effects and risk for alcoholism. We examined whether variation in glutamate decarboxylase-2 (GAD2), a gene encoding for a major enzyme in the synthesis of GABA, contributes to risk of alcohol dependence (AD). We screened GAD2 for sequence variants using dHPLC in a population of 96 individuals. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including four rare non-synonymous polymorphisms, were identified. Thirteen SNPs located in the GAD2 gene were genotyped in a sample of 113 Russian males with AD and 100 Russian male controls. These analyses revealed a modest association between the functional GAD2 -243 A > G SNP (rs2236418) and AD (allele P = 0.038, genotype P = 0.008). An additional sample of 138 Russian males with AD were genotyped for the GAD2 -243 A > G. These analyses supported an association of this polymorphism with AD (combined sample allele P = 0.038, genotype P = 0.0009). We extended these findings to additional populations: a sample of 538 college students assessed using the AUDIT and a sample of European-American (EA) AD subjects (n = 235) and controls (n = 310). Analyses in these populations did not support a role for GAD2 in alcoholism. In summary, the results of an extensive search for an association of GAD2 with AD suggest that variation in GAD2 is not a major risk factor for AD in EAs. The functional promoter GAD2 -243 A > G variant may influence risk for AD in some populations, or its role may be limited to susceptibility to severe AD.",

Within this locus, we isolated a complete cDNA of a novel gene, designated myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT). MIAT has five exons, and in vitro translation assay showed that MIAT did not encode any translational product, indicating that this is likely to be a functional RNA. In vitro functional analyses revealed that the minor variant of one SNP in exon 5 increased transcriptional level of the novel gene. Moreover, unidentified nuclear protein(s) bound more intensely to risk allele than non-risk allele. These results indicate that the altered expression of MIAT by the SNP may play some role in the pathogenesis of MI.",

An uncommon coding variant (rs11209026, c.1142G>A, p.Arg381Gln) confers strong protection against Crohn's disease, and additional noncoding IL23R variants are independently associated. Replication studies confirmed IL23R associations in independent cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

In this population-based case control study (n = 455 cases; 527 controls), we examined the only identified nonsynonymous polymorphism (Ala394Thr; rs2305160) in the largest circadian gene, neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2), in order to examine its impact on NHL risk. Our results demonstrate a robust association of the variant Thr genotypes (Ala/Thr and Thr/Thr) with reduced risk of NHL (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51-0.85, p = 0.001), especially B-cell lymphoma (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.47-0.80, p <or= 0.0001).

Here, delta-like 1 homolog (Drosophila) (DLK1), a paternally expressed gene, was found to be significantly up-regulated in 60 (73.2%) of a total of 82 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, immunohistochemistry staining was performed in another 88 HCC specimens, of which 50 (56.8%) cancerous tissues were considered as positive. The expression of DLK1 was obviously induced in HCC cells, Bel-7402 and MHCC-H, by a demethylation agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Furthermore, both demethylation of the DLK1 promoter (-565 to -362) and hypermethylation of the imprinting control domain in the region upstream of maternally expressed gene 3 were identified in a few HCC specimens. This implies that deregulation of genomic DNA methylation of the imprinted domain could be attributed to the up-regulation of DLK1 in HCC, although the undoubtedly complex mechanisms involved in the epigenetic event should be further investigated in HCC. Surprisingly, the expression of DLK1 in HCC was confirmed to be monoallelic specific, not biallelic, in three HCC specimens with a single nucleotide polymorphism as at T852C (rs2295660). Importantly, the exogenous DLK1 can significantly promote the cell proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells, a HCC cell line, whereas the suppression of endogenetic DLK1 through RNA interference can markedly inhibit cell growth, colony formation and tumorigenicity of HepG2, Hep3B and HuH-7 cells. These data suggest that DLK1 as an imprinted gene could be significantly up-regulated in HCC due to certain epigenetic events and contribute to the oncogenesis of this tumor.",

We examined the association between CYP19A1 genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer survival in a cohort of 1,136 patients who were recruited as part of a population-based case-control study in Shanghai, China from 1996 to 1998 and who has donated a DNA sample to the study. Patients were followed for cancer recurrence and mortality through July 2005. Nineteen haplotype tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the CYP19A1 gene were evaluated. For each of the five SNPs located in haplotype block 2, patients homozygous for the minor alleles had a reduced 5-year disease-free survival rate compared with those carrying the major allele. The age-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were 1.5 (1.1-2.1), 2.1 (1.2-3.6), 1.5 (1.1-2.0), 1.4 (1.0-2.0), and 1.4 (1.0-2.0) for hCV1664178, rs12900137, rs730154, rs936306, and rs1902586, respectively. Haplotype analyses showed that the haplotype CCCTA (all minor alleles of the five SNPs in block 2) was associated with decreased disease-free survival (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.3). The nonsynonymous SNP, rs700519 (Arg264Cys), located in haplotype block 4, was also associated with breast cancer survival. The age-adjusted HR for the Cys/Cys (T/T) genotype was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.2-4.1) for overall survival and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-3.9) for disease-free survival, compared with those carrying the Arg (C) allele. These results suggest that polymorphisms in the CYP19A1 gene may have effects on breast cancer prognosis.",

Five hundred fifty-three smokers were enrolled into a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and followed for 12 months. Five candidate genes [DRD2 Taq1 (rs1800497), DRD2-141 (rs1799732), C957T (rs6277), COMT (rs4818), and SLC6A3] were genotyped. Weights at baseline, at end of treatment, and after 6 and 12 months of follow-up were self-reported. Smoking abstinence at each endpoint was self-reported and confirmed biochemically. A self-reported average weight gain after 12 months of 1.1 +/- 6.0 kg (mean +/- standard deviation) in the bupropion group and 1.8 +/- 4.8 kg in the placebo group was noted. For subjects with biochemically confirmed abstinence from smoking, the HL genotype (alleles coding Val at codon 108 are denoted as H, and those coding Met are denoted as L) at the COMT locus and A1A1 genotype at the DRD2 Taq1 locus were associated with less weight gain at the end of treatment. The TC genotype at the C957T locus was associated with increased weight gain at 6 months of follow-up. However, no polymorphisms or their interactions with bupropion consistently and significantly predicted baseline BMI or weight change during treatment for all study subjects. Overall, our results do not support a major role for these five candidate genes in weight gain after smoking cessation.",

The genotype distribution of four common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the COX-2 gene (rs689466:A496G, rs20417:G926C, rs5277:G3050C, rs5275:C8473T) was analyzed in PD patients and control subjects in a Swedish population. No differences could be seen between the PD-patient and controls regarding the A496G, G926C, and G3050C SNPs, but the allele frequency of the C8473T SNP was found to differ when male patients were compared to controls (P = 0.007). In females no difference could be seen between PD-patients and controls. In conclusion, the results suggest a possible influence of the COX-2 C8473T SNP in PD, although it only seems to be of importance in men.",

Biol. 7:281-289, 2006.--Acute mountain sickness (AMS) causes significant morbidity among visitors to altitude. The primary contributors to developing AMS are altitude and rate of ascent; however, the substantial variation in susceptibility between individuals has led a number of investigators to propose that there may be genetic predilection to the disease. The ACE I/D polymorphism has been shown to predict performance among elite mountaineers. This study compares genotype and allele frequencies at the ACE I/D locus, two other loci in the ACE gene, and one locus in the angiotensin-2 receptor gene between individuals who did, or did not, express signs of AMS while attending a high altitude religious festival in Nepal (4380 m). Subjects (80 males, 23 females) were recruited and genotyped. All subjects were Nepalese. Forty-four of the subjects had been diagnosed with AMS by physicians at a high altitude health camp; the rest were free from altitude illness. All subjects were genotyped at polymorphic loci in the genes encoding angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene (AGTR1). The polymorphisms examined were two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACE (ACE(A-240T), dbSNP rs4291; and ACE(A2350G), dbSNP rs4343), the intronic Alu insertion in ACE (ACE I/D), and the SNP ATR(A1166C), (dbSNP rs17231380) in AGTR1d. All polymorphisms in ACE were found to be in linkage disequilibrium. No significant associations were found between AMS incidence and any of the alleles, suggesting that variants at these loci do not contribute to susceptibility to AMS in this population.",

Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protects the cells from oxidative damage by scavenging free radicals. The demand for antioxidants is increased by smoking, which could disturb the balance between antioxidants and radicals. The present study aimed to determine whether a valine/alanine polymorphism in MnSOD (V16A, rs4880), alone or in combination with smoking, can contribute to development of diabetic nephropathy in 1,510 Finnish and Swedish patients with type 1 diabetes. Overt diabetic nephropathy (n = 619) was defined as having an albumin excretion rate (AER) >200 microg/min or renal replacement therapy; incipient diabetic nephropathy was defined as having an AER of 20-200 microg/min (n = 336). The control subjects had diabetes duration of >or=20 years, without albuminuria (AER <20 microg/min) and without antihypertensive treatment (n = 555). In addition to male sex and elevated A1C, smoking was significantly associated with diabetic nephropathy (overt plus incipient), odds ratio (OR) 2.00 (95% CI 1.60-2.50). When controlling for age at onset, diabetes duration, A1C, smoking, and sex, the Val/Val genotype was associated with an increase in risk of diabetic nephropathy (1.32 [1.00-1.74], P = 0.049). When evaluating the combined effect of genotype and smoking, we used logistic regression with stratification according to smoking status and genotype. The high-risk group (ever smoking plus Val/Val genotype) had 2.52 times increased risk of diabetic nephropathy (95% CI 1.73-3.69) compared with the low-risk group, but no departure from additivity was found. Our results indicate that smoking and homozygosity for the MnSOD Val allele is associated with an increased risk of diabetic nephropathy, which supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress contributes to the development of diabetic nephropathy.",

We investigated CETP sequence variants in response to long-term overfeeding (100 days) in 12 pairs of male monozygotic twins (mean age+/-S.D.: 21+/-2 years). Body fat mass (FM), abdominal subcutaneous (ASF) and visceral fat (AVF), and plasma lipoproteins were determined. The CETP variants C>T/In9 (rs289714) and G>A/Ex14 (rs5882, or I405V) were investigated by RFLP-PCR methodologies. Before overfeeding, the CETP CC/In9 (n=18) genotype was associated with lower FM compared to the C>T/In9 heterozygotes. Overfeeding induced more FM and ASF accretion in C>T/In9 carriers (P<or=0.05). CETP V405V homozygotes (n=8) had lower BMI, FM, and ASF before overfeeding than those with the I405I (n=6) or I405V (n=10) genotypes. However, V405V subjects had the largest gain in AVF with overfeeding (P=0.02). Decreases from baseline were significantly different across the I405V genotypes for HDL-C, HDL-Apo AI, HDL(2), and HDL(3) (P<or=0.05). Our data suggests that CETP sequence variation contributes to the undesirable changes in adiposity and HDL-C levels when exposed to excessive calorie consumption and may be potentially helpful to identify individuals with the metabolic syndrome who are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease.",

In order to examine the association of common genetic variation in the base-excision repair (BER) pathway with bladder cancer risk, we analyzed 43 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 BER genes (OGG1, MUTYH, APEX1, PARP1, PARP3, PARP4, XRCC1, POLB, POLD1, PCNA, LIG1, and LIG3). Using genotype data from 1,150 cases of urinary bladder transitional cell carcinomas and 1,149 controls from the Spanish Bladder Cancer Study we estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for age, gender, region and smoking status. SNPs in three genes showed significant associations with bladder cancer risk: the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase gene (OGG1), the Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 1 (PARP1) and the major gap filling polymerase-beta (POLB). Subjects who were heterozygous or homozygous variant for an OGG1 SNP in the promoter region (rs125701) had significantly decreased bladder cancer risk compared to common homozygous: OR (95%CI) 0.78 (0.63-0.96). Heterozygous or homozygous individuals for the functional SNP PARP1 rs1136410 (V762A) or for the intronic SNP POLB rs3136717 were at increased risk compared to those homozygous for the common alleles: 1.24 (1.02-1.51) and 1.30 (1.04-1.62), respectively. In summary, data from this large case-control study suggested bladder cancer risk associations with selected BER SNPs, which need to be confirmed in other study populations.",

AGTR1 polymorphism has been reported to associate with hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI), and metabolic traits. Here we describe a novel approach to quantitation of transcript haplotypes (QTH) of AGTR1. To determine relative allelic expression from haplotypes, within-individual-between-allele ratiometric analyses in placental cDNA were developed for the transcribed SNPs rs5182:C>T (encoding p.L191) and rs5186:A>C (3'-noncoding \"A1166C\"). Additionally, between-individual comparisons were made using TaqMan assays applied to both homozygous and heterozygous genotypes and haplotypes. In conjunction, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and genomic haplotype associations with metabolic syndrome were examined. There was no significant difference of mRNA level for alleles of rs5182:C>T, but allele and mRNA haplotypes carrying 1166C exhibited reduced abundance. The effect was much greater in CC homozygotes than in heterozygotes. The promoter region was confirmed to be in a separate haplotype block from the AGTR1 3' region containing rs5182:C>T and rs5186:A>C. Metabolic syndrome trait associations were strongest for the 3' block generally and for the C allele of rs5186:A>C specifically. All effects were much more prominent in homozygotes, possibly reflecting interallelic interaction through feedback loops of mRNA regulation. Differential abundance of AGTR1 mRNA haplotypes may mediate clinical phenotypic observations of the AGTR1 genotype.",

In this study, we used a multifaceted analytic approach to explore the relationship between eight single nucleotide polymorphisms in base excision repair (BER) pathway genes, smoking, and bladder cancer susceptibility in a hospital-based case-control study. Overall, we did not find an association between any single BER gene single nucleotide polymorphism and bladder cancer risk. However, in stratified analysis, the OGG1 S326C variant genotypes in ever smokers (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.99) and ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) V762A variant genotypes in never smokers (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.91) conferred a significantly reduced risk. Using logistic regression, we observed that there was a two-way interaction between ADPRT V762A and smoking status. We next used classification and regression tree analysis to explore high-order gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. We found that smoking is the most important influential factor for bladder cancer risk. Consistent with the above findings, we found that the ADPRT V762A was only significantly involved in bladder cancer risk in never smokers and the OGG1 S326C was only significantly involved in ever smokers. We also observed gene-gene interactions among OGG1 S326C, XRCC1 R194W, and MUTYH H335Q in ever smokers. Using multifactor dimensionality reduction approach, the four-factor model, including smoking status, OGG1 S326C (rs1052133), APEX1 D148E (rs3136820), and ADPRT762 (rs1136410), had the best ability to predict bladder cancer risk with the highest cross-validation consistency (100%) and the lowest prediction error (37.02%; P < 0.001). These results support the hypothesis that genetic variants in BER genes contribute to bladder cancer risk through gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions.",

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics\nWe serendipitously identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 8636C>A (rs1804197) in the 3'-untranslated region of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene to be associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In order to gain further evidence for the association between the APC locus and ASD, we genotyped four additional adjacent common SNPs (rs2229992, rs42427, rs459552, and rs465899) in the coding regions within the APC gene in a set of Swedish ASDs and controls. One common haplotype TGAG was found to be associated with ASD after haplotype analysis using both Haploview v3.1.1 (P = 0.006) and COCAPHASE v2.403 (P = 0.030). This result is the first to suggest that the genomic locus at APC is associated with ASD, and that the APC gene itself is a good predisposing candidate to be evaluated in future studies due to its important role in neuronal development and function.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human SH2B gene are associated with these variables. A tagging SNP (tSNP), Ala484Thr (rs7498665), was selected to represent five common SNPs (minor allele frequency > 0.05) in perfect linkage disequilibrium in a 16-kb region encompassing the SH2B gene. The tSNP was genotyped in 2455 white female twins (mean age, 47.4 +/- 12.6 years) from the St. Thomas' United Kingdom Adult Twin Registry (Twins United Kingdom). Ala484Thr (minor allele frequency, 0.38) was associated with serum leptin, total fat, waist circumference, and body weight (P = 0.02 to 0.04). The coding SNP has no predicted effect on protein structure or function and is likely to be in linkage disequilibrium with an as-yet unidentified functional variant in the SH2B gene. Our results support a role for SH2-B in modulating the regulation of body weight and fat by leptin in this female population. If SH2-B signaling is attenuated in diet-induced obesity, it could become a target for drug-induced leptin sensitization.",

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics\nDisrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) is located on 1q42.1, one of the most promising susceptibility loci in schizophrenia linkage studies. A non-synonymous genetic variation rs821616 (Ser704Cys) in DISC1, has recently been shown to be associated with schizophrenia in family-based study [Callicott et al. (2005); Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102: 8627-8632]. In order to further confirm this issue, we examined four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a chromosomal region spanning 42 kb of this gene, namely rs821616, rs821597, rs4658971, and rs843979, in Chinese sample of 313 schizophrenia patients and 317 healthy controls. Our results showed that two SNPs had strong associations with schizophrenia (rs821616: Allele A > T, chi(2) = 7.8006, df = 1, P = 0.0052; Genotype, chi(2) = 7.7935, df = 2, P = 0.0203; rs821597: Allele A > G, chi(2) = 9.5404, df = 1, P = 0.0020; Genotype, chi(2) = 12.2780, df = 2, P = 0.0022). When haplotypes were constructed with two, three, and four markers, a number of haplotype combinations, especially those including rs821616 and rs821597, were significantly associated with schizophrenia. Furthermore, there was a strong evidence for association in a four-marker haplotype analysis (chi(2) = 7.686, df = 4, P = 0.005581, corrected P = 0.006199). Although the case-control and family-based association studies both suggest that DISC1 gene may play a role in genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia, the risk haplotypic combinations have subtle differences in the two studies. Our findings provide further evidence for DISC1 as a predisposing gene involved in schizophrenia in the Chinese Han Population.",

We also examined two SNPs in the IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). The age, height, and body mass of the 151 subjects studied were 24.1 +/- 5.2 yr, 170.8 +/- 9.9 cm, and 73.3 +/- 17.0 kg, respectively. There were no significant associations of phenotypes with IGF-I.

We genotyped nine SNPs for which there was some prior evidence of an association with breast cancer: CASP8 D302H (rs1045485), IGFBP3 -202 C --> A (rs2854744), SOD2 V16A (rs1799725), TGFB1 L10P (rs1982073), ATM S49C (rs1800054), ADH1B 3' UTR A --> G (rs1042026), CDKN1A S31R (rs1801270), ICAM5 V301I (rs1056538) and NUMA1 A794G (rs3750913). We included data from 9-15 studies, comprising 11,391-18,290 cases and 14,753-22,670 controls. We found evidence of an association with breast cancer for CASP8 D302H (with odds ratios (OR) of 0.89 (95% confidence interval (c.i.): 0.85-0.94) and 0.74 (95% c.i.: 0.62-0.87) for heterozygotes and rare homozygotes, respectively, compared with common homozygotes; P(trend) = 1.1 x 10(-7)) and weaker evidence for TGFB1 L10P (OR = 1.07 (95% c.i.: 1.02-1.13) and 1.16 (95% c.i.: 1.08-1.25), respectively; P(trend) = 2.8 x 10(-5)). These results demonstrate that common breast cancer susceptibility alleles with small effects on risk can be identified, given sufficiently powerful studies.",

A pivotal role of dopamine neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex has been implicated in drug-seeking behavior and related personality traits, such as sensation seeking, with some evidence for a gender-specific association. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the COMT Val158Met polymorphism modulates the personality dimension, sensation seeking, in a gender-dependent manner. Study sample included 214 male (age 38.1+/-12.6 years) and 218 female (age 36.1+/-13.6 years) healthy volunteers, who were assessed with Zuckerman's sensation-seeking scale and genotyped for the Val158Met polymorphism (dbSNP:rs4680). Univariate analysis of variance showed that the sensation seeking score was significantly affected by a COMT genotype x gender interaction (F=5.330, df=2, p=0.005). The Val158Met polymorphism was associated with the sensation seeking personality trait in women only. The highest scores in the sensation-seeking scale and in three of the four subscales were observed in female subjects with the Val/Val genotype relative to women carrying the Met allele. Our results suggest that high COMT enzyme activity associated with the Val allele predisposes to high sensation seeking scores in female subjects and add to increasing evidence for a gender specific role of COMT in normal and dysfunctional behavior.",

The enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), encoded by the MTHFR gene, is involved in this process. We investigated both the independent and joint effects of dietary folate and other methyl-related nutrients, as well as three polymorphisms of MTHFR (677C>T, 1298A>C, and 1793G>A), on endometrial cancer risk in a population-based case-control study. Between 1997 and 2003, 1,204 newly diagnosed endometrial cancer cases and 1,212 controls were recruited among women between the ages of 30 and 69 years in urban Shanghai, China. Information on dietary intake of folate and other methyl-related nutrients, including vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and methionine, was derived from a validated food frequency questionnaire. Genotyping was completed on 1,041 cases and 1,030 controls for MTHFR 677C>T (rs1801133), 1298A>C (rs1801131), and 1793 G>A (rs2274967) [corrected] Haplotype estimation of the three single-nucleotide polymorphisms was performed using PHASE software. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to evaluate associations of nutrients, MTHFR genotypes, and haplotypes with endometrial cancer risk. A significant inverse association between dietary folate intake and endometrial cancer risk was observed among all subjects and non-B vitamin supplement users. The greatest reduction in endometrial cancer risk was observed among non-users of supplements in the highest quartile of dietary folate intake (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7) as compared with those in the lowest quartile. Dietary intake of folate cofactors (methionine, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12) was not related to risk of endometrial cancer. No association was observed between endometrial cancer and the MTHFR 677C>T, 1298 A>C, and 1793G>A polymorphisms or derived haplotypes. Among non-users of supplements, however, the 1298C and 1793A alleles were associated with a lower risk of endometrial cancer among women with high dietary folate intake but related to a higher risk among those with low dietary folate intake (P(interaction) = 0.08 and 0.03, respectively). Further analysis showed that the lowest risk (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-1.1) was among women with the 1298C allele and the highest intake of both folate and riboflavin (P(interaction) = 0.04). A similar association was observed for the 1793A allele (P(interaction) = 0.03). Our findings suggest that folate intake may decrease the risk of endometrial cancer and modify the effect of MTHFR polymorphisms on risk.",

As a result, four novel and one known single nucleotide transitions were identified, including c.58-2A>G, c.111C>T, c.156G>T, c.594G>A, and c.216C>A (rs3750075). The frequencies of genotype CA, allele A of c.216C>A and haplotype 'GAG' consisting of c.156G>T, c.216C>A, and c.594G>A were significantly lower in infertile patients than those in controls. These findings suggest that the FKBP6 gene may play a role in modifying the susceptibility to idiopathic spermatogenic impairment in human and propose that the allele A of c.216C>A seems to be a protective factor for the development of male infertility.",

Part A\nPhenotypic characteristics expressed in syndromes give clues to the factors involved in the cause of isolated forms of the same defects. We investigated two genes responsible for craniofacial syndromes, FGFR1 and IRF6, in a collection of families with isolated tooth agenesis. Cheek swab samples were obtained for DNA analysis from 116 case/parent trios. Probands had at least one developmentally missing tooth, excluding third molars. In addition, we studied 89 cases and 50 controls from Ohio to replicate any positive findings. Genotyping was performed by kinetic polymerase chain-reaction or TaqMan assays. Linkage disequilibrium analysis and transmission distortion of the marker alleles were performed. The same variants in the IRF6 gene that are associated with isolated orofacial clefts are also associated with human tooth agenesis (rs861019, P = 0.058; rs17015215-V274I, P = 0.0006; rs7802, P = 0.004). Mutations in IRF6 cause Van der Woude and popliteal pterygium syndromes. The craniofacial phenotypic characteristics of these syndromes include oral clefts and preferential tooth agenesis of incisors and premolars, besides pits on the lower lips. Also it appears that preferential premolar agenesis is associated with FGFR1 (P = 0.014) and IRF6 (P = 0.002) markers. There were statistically significant data suggesting that IRF6 interacts not only with MSX1 (P = 0.001), but also with TGFA (P = 0.03).",

Six SNPs showed nominal associations with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.001-0.04), including the nonsynonymous SNP rs1058405 (M67V) in exon 3 and rs11579627 in the 3' flanking region. Only rs1159627 remained significant on permutation testing. The associations were not replicated in 353 African-American case subjects and 182 control subjects, nor were ATF6 SNPs associated with altered insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic Caucasian individuals. No association with type 2 diabetes was found in a subset of 44 SNPs in Caucasian (n = 2,099), Pima Indian (n = 293), and Chinese (n = 287) samples. Allelic expression imbalance was found in transformed lymphocyte cDNA for 3' untranslated region variants, thus suggesting cis-acting regulatory variants. ATF6 does not appear to play a major role in type 2 diabetes, but further work is required to identify the cause of the allelic expression imbalance.",

Dunningan-type lipodystrophy is characterized by loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes and shares many of the features of the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, several genome-wide linkage scans for type 2 diabetes have found evidence of linkage at chromosome 1q21.2, the region that harbors the LMNA gene. Therefore, LMNA is a biological and positional candidate for type 2 diabetes susceptibility. Previous studies have reported association between a common LMNA variant (1908C>T; rs4641) and adverse metabolic traits in ethnically diverse populations from Asia and North America. In the present study, we characterized the common variation across the LMNA gene (including rs4641) and tested for association with type 2 diabetes in two large case-control studies (n = 2,052) and with features of the metabolic syndrome in a separate cohort study (n = 1,572). Despite our study being sufficiently powered to detect effects similar and even smaller in magnitude than those previously reported, none of the LMNA single nucleotide polymorphisms were statistically significantly associated with type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Thus, it appears unlikely that variation at LMNA substantially increases the risk of type 2 diabetes or related traits in U.K. Europids.",

The role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TGFB1 in asthma remains inconclusive. We examined TGFB1 SNPs in relation to asthma risk and degree of atopy among 546 case-parent triads, consisting of asthmatics aged 4-17 years and their parents in Mexico City. Atopy to 24 aeroallergens was determined by skin prick tests. We genotyped five TGFB1 SNPs, including two known functional SNPs [C-509T (rs1800469), T869C (rs1982073)] and three others (rs7258445, rs1800472, rs8179181), using TaqMan and Masscode assays. We analyzed the data using log-linear and polytomous logistic methods. Three associated SNPs, including the two known functional SNPs, were statistically significantly related to asthma risk. Individuals carrying the T allele of C-509T had an increased risk of asthma [relative risk (RR)=1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.08-1.87 for one copy; RR (95%CI)=1.95 (1.36-2.78) for two copies]. For T869C, the RRs (95%CI) were 1.47 (1.09-1.98) for one and 2.00 (1.38-2.90) for two copies of the C allele. Similar results were found for rs7258445. The haplotype containing all three risk alleles conferred an increased risk of asthma (RR=1.48, 95% CI=1.11-1.95 for one copy; RR=1.77, 95% CI=1.22-2.57 for two copies). These three SNPs were also related to the degree of atopy. This largest study to date of genetic variation in TGFB1 and asthma and atopy adds to increasing evidence for a role in these disorders.",

Recently, pathogenic mutations in MATP have been shown to cause oculocutaneous albinism type 4, while other polymorphisms are known to have a role in normal pigmentation variation. We previously reported significant associations of two coding region polymorphisms with hair, skin, and eye color in Caucasians. Here we characterize the promoter region of MATP identifying two new transcription start sites and a novel duplication (c.-1176_-1174dupAAT). A total of 700 individuals from five different population groups (529 Caucasians, 38 Asians, 46 African Americans, 47 Australian Aborigines, and 40 Spanish Basques) were genotyped for known promoter polymorphisms c.-1721C>G (rs13289) and c.-1169G>A (rs6867641), as well as c.-1176_-1174dupAAT. Allele frequencies of all three polymorphisms were significantly different between population groups. In Caucasians, the -1721G, +dup, and -1169A alleles were significantly associated with olive skin color. The three promoter polymorphisms were found to be in linkage disequilibrium with each other but not with the two previously reported coding region polymorphisms. Functional analyses in a melanoma cell line showed that the promoter haplotype -1721G, +dup, -1169A significantly decreased MATP transcription. This report provides further evidence for the involvement of MATP in normal pigmentation variation by identifying associations between MATP alleles and skin color variation in Caucasians and demonstrating a functional significance of these polymorphisms.",

We studied the genotype distributions and allele frequencies of three CYP2E1 polymorphisms: CYP2E1*5B (RsaI/PstI RFLP, C-1053T/G-1293C SNP, rs2031920 /rs3813867), CYP2E1*6 (DraI RFLP, T7632A SNP, rs6413432), and CYP2E1*7B (DdeI RFLP, G-71T SNP, rs6413420) by PCR/RFLP technique in a sample of 206 healthy subjects representing Turkish population. CYP2E1*5B polymorphism analysis yielded the genotype distribution as 96.12% for *1A/*1A (c1/c1), and 3.88% for *1A/*5B (c1/c2). The genotype frequencies for CYP2E1*6 polymorphism were found as 83.98% for *1A/*1A (T/T), 15.53% for *1A/*6 (T/A) and 0.49% for *6/*6 (A/A). For CYP2E1*7B (G-71T) polymorphism, the genotype frequencies were determined to be 86.89% for *1A/*1A (G/G), 12.62% for *1A/*7B (G/T) and 0.49% for *7B/*7B (T/T). Accordingly, the allele frequencies for *5B, *6 and *7B were 1.94, 8.25, and 6.80%, respectively. The genotype distributions of CYP2E1*5B and *6 in Turkish population were similar to those in other Caucasian populations, while differed significantly from East Asian populations. Recently, a novel and functionally important CYP2E1*7B polymorphism was identified in the promoter region. There have been few studies and limited data on CYP2E1*7B polymorphism frequency in the world and, so far, no information has been available for Turkish population. The genotype frequencies of CYP2E1*7B in Turkish population were found to be similar to those of other Caucasian populations. Population studies like this could be useful in assessing the susceptibility of different populations to chemical-induced diseases, including several types of cancer.",

Although the genetic influence is clear for both diseases, the genetics involved is complex and epistatic interactions with other genes probably exist. The Fc receptor-like 3 gene (FCRL3) maps to the human chromosome 1q21-22 and certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in its promoter have been associated with some autoimmune diseases. Our aim was to study the role of two promoter SNPs of the FCRL3 gene (-169A>G, rs7528684 and -110C>T, rs11264799) in patients with IBD and their interaction with HLA-DRB1 and CARD15 in patients with UC and CD, respectively. A case-control study with 311 patients with CD, 324 patients with UC and 497 healthy controls was performed. All the individuals were White Spaniards. No significant associations were found between any FCRL3 SNP and CD or UC, but the stratification in patients with UC by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) showed a significant increase in heterozygosity at the FCRL3 locus, especially -169 AG (AG vs AA+GG, P= 0.0027, odds ratio = 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.9), when HLA-DRB1*0103 carrier patients were compared with HLA-DRB1*0103 noncarriers. Our data suggest an epistatic interaction between genes in chromosomes 6p21 and 1q21-22, marked, respectively, by HLA-DRB1*0103 and FCRL3-169 AG.",

Two PGC1A variants Thr394Thr (rs2970847) and Gly482Ser (rs8192673) were genotyped in 822 subjects (351 T2DM cases and 471 controls) from two North Indian populations, represented as Group 1 (Kashmir population) and Group 2 (Punjab and Jammu population). Both Groups 1 and 2 showed a significant association of Thr394Thr variant with T2DM after applying Bonferroni corrections (P=0.001 and 0.012, respectively). Logistic regression analysis for Thr394Thr susceptible genotypes together (rs2970847 G/A and A/A) conferred a 1.89-(95%CI 1.25-2.85) fold higher risk for T2DM in Group 1 and 1.81-(95%CI 1.19-2.78) fold risk in Group 2. The susceptible, Ser482 (rs8192673 G/A and A/A) genotypes, gave a 2.04 (95%CI 1.47-3.03) fold higher risk for T2DM in Group 1. Mitochondrial genotype backgrounds observed in association with T2DM (Bhat et al. 2007), when studied in combination with PGC1A variants, showed an increased prevalence in controls with mt10398G and 16189T along with G/G genotype background at the two polymorphic loci of PGC1A. These observations suggest that the two genotype backgrounds together could provide protection against T2DM.",

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics\nADHD is generally deemed to be a highly heritable disorder with mean heritability of 0.75. The enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO), which has both A and B types, has long been considered a candidate pathological substrate for ADHD, and more recently, the genes for both MAO enzymes have been examined as mediators of the illness. Previous studies indicated that 30-50% of children with ADHD will experience symptoms that persist into adolescence and will have more significant impairment in social and neuropsychological functioning compared to those whose symptoms have remitted. Genes may also influence these characteristics of the disorder, and in this context MAO genes may also be candidates for moderating the presentation of ADHD. The current study examined the association between adolescent outcome of ADHD and MAO gene polymorphisms, including the 941T > G polymorphism in exon 8 (rs1799835) and 1460C > T polymorphism in exon 14 (rs1137070) of the MAOA gene, and the A > G polymorphism in intron13 (rs1799836), C > T polymorphism in the 3'UTR (rs1040399), and 2327T > C polymorphism in exon15 of the MAOB gene. Significant associations were observed between the MAOA gene polymorphisms and ADHD remission. Due to the small sample size and the possibility of phenotypic and etiologic heterogeneity of ADHD outcomes across ethnic or geographic groups, these results must be replicated before they can be generalized to other populations.",

Increasing evidence has implicated that aberrant glycosylation of IgA1 molecules, including alpha2,6 sialic acid defects, are involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN. In the present study, we designed an association study to investigate polymorphisms of two important genes, ST6GALNAC2 and NEU1, which are involved in the sialylation of the IgA1 molecule, in the susceptibility to IgAN. A total of 670 patients with histologically proven IgAN and 494 healthy controls were enrolled. Screening of SNPs in the coding and promoter regions of the ST6GALNAC2 and NEU1 genes was performed by sequencing. ST6-SNP1 (c.-988A>G), ST6-SNP2 [rs3840858:D>I(CGGC), c.-450_-449insCGGC], ST6-SNP3 (rs1867561:C>G, c.-135C>G), and ST6-SNP7 (rs2304921:G>A, c.186+12G>A) in the ST6GALNAC2 gene were selected as tagging SNPs. Functional evaluations of targets were assayed by luciferase activity. The alpha2,6 sialic acid contents of serum IgA1 in 497 patients were analyzed. Our results demonstrated that the frequency of haplotype ADG in the promoter region of ST6GALNAC2 was significantly higher in IgAN patients than that in controls (p=0.0069; odds ratio [OR]=1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.72). Furthermore, the ADG haplotype was associated with the deficient degrees of alpha2,6 sialic acid of IgA1 molecules in IgAN patients (r=0.408, p=0.0035). The ADG haplotype conferred significantly reduced promoter activity compared with the most common haplotype GDG in vitro (196.43+/-21.55 vs. 258.41+/-46.25; p=0.002). In the present study, we identified for the first time the ADG haplotype in the ST6GALNAC2 gene as a functional regulatory variant that may contribute to the genetic susceptibility in a subset of patients in whom the desialylation of IgA1 molecules was the main causative pathogenesis of IgAN.",

The COMT gene is located on 22q11.2, a common susceptibility locus for schizophrenia. Therefore, COMT is a strong functional and positional candidate gene for schizophrenia. A common functional polymorphism (rs4680, Val158Met) has been extensively tested for an association with schizophrenia, but with conflicting results. Recent studies indicate that if COMT is implicated in susceptibility to schizophrenia, this cannot be wholly accounted for by the Val158Met polymorphism. To assess this view, the authors conducted a case-control association study (399 patients with schizophrenia and 440 control subjects) for five functional polymorphisms (rs2075507, rs737865, rs6267, rs4680 and rs165599) in Japanese subjects. There were no significant associations found between the polymorphisms or haplotypes of COMT and schizophrenia. The present study shows that these five functional COMT polymorphisms do not play a major role in conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia in Japanese.",

Associations between blood pressure (BP) change after Na(+)-load and 15 SNPs spanning the length of CLCNKA and CLCNKB and six SNPs spanning the length of BSND were studied in 314 never treated essential hypertensives who underwent an i.v. infusion of saline (300 mm NaCl in 2 l H(2)O in 120 min). Four SNPs were significantly associated with BP change after Na-load. Rs848307 (P = 0.0026) and rs1739843 (P = 0.0023) map upstream the 5' of CLCNKA. Non-coding Rs1010069 (P = 0.0006) and non-synonymous rs1805152 (Thr447Ala; P = 0.0078) map within CLCNKA. Moreover, basal plasma renin activity and heart rate (measured before Na-load) were significantly lower in patients carrying the alleles associated with the larger mean BP increase after Na-load, indicating that such alleles are associated with chronic volume expansion.

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics\nRecent genetic studies have shown that variants of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, ABCA1, may be implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this case-control study, a panel of 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (including three amino-acid-coding SNPs used for replication of previous work, and 16 newly selected intronic tag SNPs) was genotyped. Nominally significant single marker P-values were observed in four SNPs, with the highest score of 0.003 for rs2297404 (OR = 1.88, 95%CI 1.23-2.87). In addition, six distinct linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks were detected. LD block1 harbored three nominally significant SNPs (rs2297404, rs2230808, and rs2020927), and showed a different haplotype structure in the affected and unaffected groups. Of the four haplotypes identified, haplotype2 (CAC) was more prevalent in the disease group (0.323 in AD vs. 0.202 in control); while haplotype1 (TGG) was over-represented in the healthy controls (0.595 in control vs. 0.493 in AD), indicating disease risk conferring possibility of haplotype2. After doubling the sample size, the three nominally significant SNPs were still significantly associated with AD. Although coding SNP (rs2230808) was confirmed to have a significant association with AD, prediction of the effects of an amino acid substitution SNP rs2230808 (R1587K) on the three-dimensional structure and function of the ABCA1 protein using PolyPhen program revealed that it is unlikely to be functionally significant. However, the adjacent rs2297404 in the same LD block is potentially functionally significant because of its position in the immediate vicinity of a splicing branch site. Further functional analysis of this polymorphism should be a high priority.",

We employed nine polymorphisms from the BAT1-NFKBIL1-LTA region and one polymorphism from the LGALS2 gene, and investigated whether such associations were also present in Europeans. The study included 3657 patients with myocardial infarction and 1211 control individuals with angiographically normal coronary arteries. Minor homozygous genotypes of polymorphisms in BAT1 (rs2239527, -23C/G), NFKBIL1 (rs2071592, -63T/A) and LTA (rs1800683, -162G/A; rs909253, 252G/A; rs1041981, Thr26Asn) were associated with moderately protective effects against myocardial infarction (P </= 0.045). The most abundant 9-marker haplotype of the BAT1-NFKBIL1-LTA region, named haplotype 1 (28% frequency in the study population), included the alleles of the five protective genotypes and was related with a significantly lower risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.98; P = 0.015). Moreover, homozygosity for haplotype 1 was associated with an OR 0.72 (95% CI 0.57-0.90; P = 0.0047). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an independent protective effect against myocardial infarction in the homozygous carriers of haplotype 1 (adjusted OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.99; P = 0.043). A putative risk genotype of the polymorphism in the LGALS2 gene (rs7291467; 3279T/C) was not associated with myocardial infarction (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83-1.16; P = 0.84). Our finding that protective effects are linked with minor homozygous genotypes and haplotype 1 of the BAT1-NFKBIL1-LTA region in Europeans is opposite to the observation of associated risks in Japanese.",

We analyzed the contribution of non-synonymous mutations V103I (rs2229616, c.307G > A) and I251L (no rs, c.751A > C) to obesity in 16 797 individuals of European origin from nine independent case-control, population-based and familial cohorts. We observed a consistent negative association of I251L variant (prevalence ranging 0.41-1.21%) with both childhood and adult class III obesity [odds ratio (OR) ranging from 0.25 to 0.76, 0.001 < P-value < 0.05] and with modulation of body mass index (BMI) in general populations, in eight out of nine studies, whereas only one study showed an association between V103I and BMI. Meta-analyses of previous published data with the current ones provided strong evidence of the protective effect of I251L toward obesity (OR = 0.52, P = 3.58 10-5), together with a modest negative association between V103I and obesity (OR = 0.80, P = 0.002). Taken together, gain-of-function mutations I251L and V103I may be responsible for a preventive fraction of obesity of 2%, which mirrors the prevalence of monogenic obesity due to MC4R haploinsufficiency. These results also emphasize the importance of the MC4R signalling tonus to prevent obesity, even in the context of our current obesogenic environment.",

VKOR activity itself is the rate-limiting step in gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, IX, X, protein C, S, and Z) and proteins of calcium metabolism (matrix Gla protein and osteocalcin). Gamma-carboxylation is essential for the biological activity of these proteins that have been previously hypothesised to play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. It was the objective of this study to analyse the VKORC1 genotype frequency in patients with CHD and controls from Northern Germany and to investigate the association of VKORC1 and CHD risk in patients with an European background. CHD patients (n = 901) and healthy controls (n = 521) were part of the PopGen biobank. Case and control samples were matched for ethnic and geographic origin, age and gender. After typing German CHD patients and control individuals, no evidence for a statistically significant association was detected between VKORC1 genotype and CHD phenotype. Also stratification for gender and myocardial infarction yielded no significant results. In conclusion, the discrepant association findings in Chinese and German populations may be explained by ethnic differences in genetic and perhaps environmental predisposition, modifying the polygenic CHD phenotype by interacting with VKORC1 variants and thus conferring disease susceptibility in some populations, but not in others.",

This provided suggestive evidence for linkage with heterogeneity: NPL score=2.3, p<0.009; HLOD=1.5, alpha=0.44. Mutational analysis of the entire genomic sequence of CLCN2 was performed in 24 unrelated patients from pedigrees consistent with linkage, identifying 45 sequence variants including the known non-synonymous polymorphism rs2228292 (G2154C, Glu718Asp) and a novel variant IVS4+12G>A. Intra-familial association analysis using the pedigrees and a further 308 parent-child trios showed suggestive evidence for transmission disequilibrium of the G2154C minor allele: AVE-PDT chi(1)2 = 5.17, p<0.03. Case-control analysis provided evidence for a protective effect of the IVS4+12G>A minor allele: chi(1)2 = 7.27, p<0.008. The 65 nuclear pedigrees were screened for three previously identified mutations shown to segregate with a variety of idiopathic generalised epilepsy phenotypes (597insG, IVS2-14del11 and G2144A) but none were found. We conclude that CLCN2 may be a susceptibility locus in a subset of cases of childhood absence epilepsy.",

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics\nGlycine transporter (GlyT)-1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining the glycine level at the glutamatergic synapse. Glycine is an allosteric agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Because activation of NMDA receptors is an essential step for induction of methamphetamine dependence and psychosis, differences in the functioning of GlyT-1 due to genetic variants of the GlyT-1 gene (GLYT1) may influence susceptibility. A case-control genetic association study of the GLYT1 gene examined 204 patients with methamphetamine-use disorder and 210 healthy controls. We examined three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SNP1, IVS3 + 411C > T, rs2486001; SNP2, 1056G > A, rs2248829; and SNP3, IVS11 + 22G > A, rs2248632, of the GLYT1 gene and found that SNP1 showed a significant association in both genotype (P = 0.0086) and allele (P = 0.0019) with methamphetamine-use disorder. The T-G haplotype at SNP1 and SNP2 was a significant risk factor for the disorder (P = 0.000039, odds ratio: 2.04). The present findings indicate that genetic variation of the GLYT1 gene may contribute to individual vulnerability to methamphetamine dependence and psychosis.",

Three scales, measuring the course of AMD and drusen development, were examined in two samples: the Family Age-Related Macular degeneration Study (FARMS), consisting of families ascertained through a single individual with severe AMD, and an unascertained population-based family cohort, the Beaver Dam Eye Study (BDES), which was also used to assess longitudinal changes in AMD and associations with renal function. Associations were performed by a regression accounting for known risk factors as well as familial and sibling effects. Strong evidence of the association of rs1061170 (Y402H) variation with AMD was confirmed (P = 9.15 x 10(-5) in BDES, P = 0.016 in FARMS). This association was observed in multiple AMD scales, suggesting that its role is not phenotype-specific. Polymorphisms in both CFH and HMCN1 appeared to influence the longitudinal rate of change of AMD. The rs1061170 polymorphism was also associated with a reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (P = 0.046). Another CFH polymorphism, rs800292, was similarly associated with eGFR [beta = -0.90 (P = 0.022)]. Associations between rs743137 (P = 0.05) and rs680638 (P = 0.022) in HMCN1 with calculated creatinine clearance progression were also observed. Both genes appear to play a role in both AMD and renal pathophysiology. These findings support evidence for common pathways influencing ocular and renal function and suggest that further work is required on their common determinants.",

No association was found between any CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and breast cancer. Haplotype analysis of the two loci showed that the CA haplotype was associated with the lowest risk of breast cancer, and CA/CA diplotypes were associated with a lower risk of breast cancer [OR=0.28 (0.13-0.61)] than others/others diplotypes. Moreover, this reduced risk was more pronounced among women with a lower body mass index (BMI) [OR=0.18 (0.06-0.58)] or with a shorter lifetime exposure to estrogen [OR=0.23 (0.07-0.81)].

We hypothesized that these genes are also associated with schizotypal traits, which are heritable and related to schizophrenia. We genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) from the COMT, PRODH and BDNF genes, and performed a series of association analyses between alleles, genotypes or haplotypes, and quantitative schizotypal trait scores derived from the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), in 465 Chinese healthy subjects. We found that 'years of education' was a major influence on seven out of nine schizotypal components, three schizotypal factors and the total SPQ scores. Molecular genetic analysis of COMT, PRODH and BDNF genes showed no significant effects of any variants on schizotypal components or factors of SPQ after correction for multiple testing, although there were weak association between COMT Val158Met (rs4680G/A) and the odd speech subscale (allele-wise, P=0.04; genotype-wise, P=0.049), between COMT Val158Met (rs4680G/A) and the suspiciousness subscale (genotype-wise, P=0.024), and between BDNF Val66Met and the Factor 2 interpersonal measure (genotype-wise, P=0.027) before correction. Furthermore, we found SNP Val158Met (rs4680) of the COMT gene significantly influenced the scores of some of schizotypal traits including total SPQ score, the disorganization factor and the constricted affect subscale in male subjects only. However, the effect was in the opposite direction of an earlier association with the SPQ reported by Avramopoulos et al. [Avramopoulos, D., Stefanis, N.C., Hantoumi, I., Smyrnis, N., Evdokimidis, I., Stefanis, C.N., 2002. Higher scores of self reported schizotypy in healthy young males carrying the COMT high activity allele. Molecular Psychiatry 7, 706-711].

In animal models, impaired kinesin-mediated APP transport seems to enhance formation of the neurotoxic 42 amino acid fragment of beta-amyloid (A beta 42). In man, one study suggests that a polymorphism (rs8702, 56,836G>C) in the kinesin light chain 1 gene (KNS2) may affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To further assess KNS2 as a susceptibility gene for AD we analyzed 802 patients with sporadic AD and 286 controls, 134 longitudinally followed patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 39 cognitively stable controls for the rs8702 polymorphism. The rs8702 polymorphism did not influence risk of AD (p=0.46). However, rs8702 interacted with APOE epsilon 4 carrier status in AD (p=0.006) and influenced cerebrospinal fluid levels of hyperphosphorylated tau in MCI patients who converted to AD during follow-up (p=0.018). These findings support earlier indications that genetic variability in the KNS2 gene may play a role during early stages of AD pathogenesis.",

Additional studies have shown that the polymorphisms of T-182C (rs2242446) and G1287A (rs5569) in NET gene (hSLC6A2) may affect the NET function. Therefore, in this study, we examined whether these hSLC6A2 gene polymorphisms are a susceptibility factor for alcohol dependence or its clinical subgroup(s). A total of 690 Han Chinese subjects (408 alcohol dependent patients and 282 controls) in Taiwan were recruited for this study. Individuals with alcohol dependence were classified into several clinical subgroups to reduce the clinical heterogeneity. All subjects were interviewed with identical methods, and the mental disorders were diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. The polymorphisms of T-182C and G1287A in hSLC6A2 gene were analyzed by using a standard method. No significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies of hSLC6A2 polymorphisms were found between controls and total alcohol dependence or between more homogeneous subgroups with alcohol dependence and controls. This study suggests that the polymorphisms of T-182C and G1287A in hSLC6A2 gene are not major risk factors in increasing susceptibility to either alcohol dependence or its clinical subtypes.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between the COMTVal158Met polymorphism and uterine fibroids. Participants were 972 premenopausal African American (n = 576) and white (n = 396) women from a cross-sectional sample of women in the National Institute of Environmental Health Science's Uterine Fibroid Study. Blood was collected from participants for DNA, and telephone interviews and questionnaires were completed to gather demographic and reproductive history. Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using race-specific log-risk regression models. Effect measure modification by age, body mass index, oral contraceptive use, full-term births, smoking, and alcohol use were also evaluated. Distributions of genotypes and fibroid prevalence varied by race. No associations between fibroids and Val158Met were observed among African American or white participants. This study suggests that variation in this polymorphism alone does not affect fibroid prevalence. Additional research is needed to examine other variations and haplotypes within the COMT gene.",

BDNF is released by neurons and by immune cells in MS brain. The rs6265 SNP variation of BDNF causes substitution of valine (Val) for methionine (Met) and interferes with activity-dependent BDNF secretion. A total of 209 treated MS patients (161 females; 48 males) underwent clinical brain MRI and were genotyped for the BDNF rs6265 Val66Met SNP. A subset of 108 patients had neurocognitive testing for processing speed, memory and executive function. The MRI measurements included T2 and T1-lesion volume (LV); normalized brain volume measures of whole brain (WB) volume, white and gray matter volume (NWMV and NGMV) and the diffusion-weighted imaging measure of WB mean parenchyma diffusivity (MPD). The Met66 allele status was positively associated with NGMV (P = 0.015, standardized beta = 0.15) and negatively associated with T2-LV (P = 0.041, standardized beta = -0.14).

Among the areas most severely affected are the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and their projection regions, the hippocampus and the cortex. Several lines of evidence have made brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) an important candidate gene conferring risk for AD. Recently, several reports investigated the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (Val66Met, rs6265) of the BDNF gene and AD but yielded ambiguous results. To figure out the association of this single nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF gene with sporadic AD in a Chinese Han population, we analyzed 513 patients with AD and 575 controls for the genetic association studies. Our results indicated that the distribution of the BDNF genotypes and alleles did not differ significantly. Similar results were observed when the AD and control groups were stratified by age/age at onset and sex. Our data also showed that in the Chinese Han population, the frequencies of the BDNF Met allele (46.5%) and Val allele (53.5%) were significantly different from ethnic groups from Italy, Japan and the USA. The present data revealed no significant effect of the genotypes on the age at onset for developing AD, and no significant association between the genotypes and the severity of the disease.",

In humans, three different gamma-subunits (gamma(1), gamma(2), gamma(3)) have been identified as AMPK regulators. The AMPKgamma3 (protein kinase, AMP-activated, gamma 3 non-catalytic subunit, PRKAG3) isoform plays a role in gene regulation in glucose/lipid metabolism and skeletal muscle glycogen content. We investigated whether PRKAG3, in addition to being expressed in skeletal muscle, is also expressed in human liver. We also investigated whether genetic variance in PRKAG3 is associated with glucose and/or lipid metabolism in non-diabetic whites.",

Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes may alter an individual's capacity to repair damaged DNA and may lead to genetic instability and contribute to malignant transformation. We examined the role of a polymorphism in the XRCC3 gene (rs861529; codon 241: threonine to methionine change) in determining breast cancer risk in Thai women. The study population consisted of 507 breast cancer cases and 425 healthy women. The polymorphism was analysed by fluorescence-based melting curve analysis. The XRCC3 241Met allele was found to be uncommon in the Thai population (frequency 0.07 among cases and 0.05 among controls). Odds ratios (OR) adjusted for age, body mass index, age at menarche, family history of breast cancer, menopausal status, reproduction parameters, use of contraceptives, tobacco smoking, involuntary tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and education were calculated for the entire population as well as for pre- and postmenopausal women. There was a significant association between 241Met carrier status and breast cancer risk (OR 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.44). Among postmenopausal women, a slightly higher OR (1.82, 95% CI 0.95-3.51) was found than among premenopausal women (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.82-2.69). Our findings suggest that the XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism is likely to play a modifying role in the individual susceptibility to breast cancer among Thai women as already shown for women of European ancestry.",

In addition, samples from 60 unrelated Caucasians belonging to the HapMap Project were also genotyped to confirm the allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern observed in our Caucasian livers. The allele frequencies of the-118T(9>10), I399C>T, -275T>A, and-2152C>T variants were 0.39, 0.39, 0.02, and 0.02 in the livers, respectively. The I399C>T variant was in complete LD (r(2) = 1) with-118T(9>10) (linked alleles: C and T(9), respectively). Complete LD between these two variants was also found in the HapMap samples (frequencies of-118T(9>10) and I399C>T = 0.38). I399C>T and-118T(9>10) correlated with neither UGT1A9 activities nor mRNA levels. Because of the low frequencies of the-275T>A and-2152C>T variants, an effect on phenotype could not be evaluated.

Using carefully reconstructed estimates of cumulative breast doses from occupational and personal diagnostic ionizing radiation, we investigated the potential modification of radiation-related breast cancer risk by 55 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms in 17 genes involved in base excision or DNA double-strand break repair among 859 cases and 1083 controls from the United States Radiologic Technologists (USRT) cohort. In multivariable analyses, WRN V114I (rs2230009) significantly modified the association between cumulative occupational breast dose and risk of breast cancer (adjusted for personal diagnostic exposure) (p = 0.04) and BRCA1 D652N (rs4986850), PRKDC IVS15 + 6C > T (rs1231202), PRKDC IVS34 + 39T > C (rs8178097) and PRKDC IVS31 - 634C > A (rs10109984) significantly altered the personal diagnostic radiation exposure-response relationship (adjusted for occupational dose) (p < or = 0.05). None of the remaining 50 SNPs significantly modified breast cancer radiation dose-response relationships. The USRT genetic study provided a unique opportunity to examine the joint effects of common genetic variation and ionizing radiation exposure on breast cancer risk using detailed occupational and personal diagnostic exposure data. The suggestive evidence found for modification of radiation-related breast cancer risk for 5 of the 55 SNPs evaluated requires confirmation in larger studies of women with quantified radiation breast doses in the low-to-moderate range.",

This rarely occurring problem could potentially render assignment of heterozygous genotypes uncertain. When the PCR conditions were studied, it was found that substitution of the dGTP nucleotide in the master mix by dGTP and dITP in proportion 1:1 largely overcame this problem. Heat denaturation of the DNA at 95 degrees C before PCR also counteracted the problem. A combination of these two modifications of the standard pyrosequencing PCR protocol gave the best results. We conclude that, with these modifications, the RFC1 c.80G>A SNP can be reliably assayed by pyrosequencing.",

However, the Cockayne syndrome caused by the ERCC6 defect has not been linked to cancer predisposition; likely due to the fact that cells with severe disruption of the ERCC6 function are sensitive to lesion-induced apoptosis, thus reducing the chance of tumorigenesis. The biological function and cancer susceptibility of a common variant rs3793784:C>G (c.-6530C>G) in the ERCC6 was examined. We show that the c.-6530C allele has lower binding affinity of Sp1 by EMSA and displays a lower transcriptional activity in vitro and in vivo. We then examined the contribution of this polymorphism to the risk of lung cancer in a case-control study with 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls. The case-control analysis revealed a 1.76-fold (P= x 10(-9)) excess risk of developing lung cancer for the c.-6530CC carriers compared with noncarriers. The c.-6530CC interacts with smoking to intensify lung cancer risk, with the odds ratio (OR)=9 for developing lung cancer among heavy smokers. Our data constituted strong evidence that ERCC6 rs3793784:C>G alters its transcriptional activity and may confer personalized susceptibility to lung cancer.",

A total of 1,064 obese subjects (BMI > or = 30 kg/m2) without diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance or other endocrine diseases and 251 healthy control persons were genotyped for the G1422A variant (rs1049353) with a TaqMan assay.

The prevalence of the G1422A variant was not significantly different between cases and controls (OR = 1.056; P = 0.626). In obese women, no meaningful associations between CNR1 genotype and anthropometric parameters were found. In obese men, CNR1 1422 A/A genotype was significantly associated with higher WHR (P = 0.009) and waist circumference (P = 0.008) after adjusting for age and BMI. Fat mass percentage showed an association (P = 0.011) which disappeared after adjusting for age and BMI. A trend for an association was seen for fat mass (unadjusted P = 0.099; adjusted P = 0.033).

Interleukins (ILs) are important mediators and modulators of inflammation. Specific polymorphisms in the genes encoding subunits of IL-23 (IL-12B) and its receptor (IL-23R) have recently been consistently found to be associated with chronic immune-mediated diseases. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that these variants also affect the risk of MI. We conducted a case-control association study on a cohort of 738 British Caucasian MI patients and 716 population controls. We tested four variants (rs11209026, rs7517847, rs1343151, rs10889677) of IL-23R and the A1188C polymorphism (rs3212227) of IL-12B. There was no association of any IL-23R (rs11209026, p = 0.82; rs7517847, p = 0.87; rs1343151, p = 0.85; rs10889677, p = 0.48) or IL-12B (rs3212227, p = 0.32) polymorphisms with MI. Stratification for age, gender and other cardiovascular risk factors did not affect the findings. These results indicate that unlike other chronic inflammatory diseases, the examined variants are unlikely to be major contributors to the pathogenesis of MI.",

To test whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes were related to risk of adult glioma, we genotyped 11 SNPs in seven cytokine genes within a hospital-based study conducted by the National Cancer Institute and an independent, population-based study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (overall 756 cases and 1190 controls with blood samples). The IL4 (rs2243248, -1098T>G) and IL6 (rs1800795, -174G>C) polymorphisms were significantly associated with risk of glioma in the pooled analysis (P trend = 0.006 and 0.04, respectively), although these became attenuated after controlling for the false discovery rate (P trend = 0.07 and 0.22, respectively). Our results underscore the importance of pooled analyses in genetic association studies and suggest that SNPs in cytokine genes may influence susceptibility to glioma.",

We identified 586 normotensive control subjects and 607 incident hypertensive case subjects from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study cohort (all whites) who were normotensive and healthy at their first clinic visit. The case subjects were diagnosed with hypertension during an average follow-up of 9.5 years, whereas the control subjects remained normotensive. The allele and genotype frequencies of 5 endothelin 1 haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms did not differ significantly between the case and control subjects. However, we observed a significant (P=0.0025) interaction between the endothelin 1 rs5370 (G/T; Lys198Asn) genotype and cardiorespiratory fitness level on the risk of hypertension: among low-fit subjects, the rs5370 minor allele (T; 198Asn) was associated with higher risk of hypertension (odds ratio: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.36 to 2.81; P=0.0003), whereas the risk did not differ among genotypes in high-fit subjects. In the white Health, Risk Factors, Exercise Training and Genetics subjects (N=480), the rs5370 T allele was associated with blunted systolic blood pressure (P=0.0046) and pulse pressure (P=0.0016) responses to a 20-week endurance training program. The Lys198Asn variant of the endothelin 1 locus is associated with blood pressure phenotypes in whites. However, the expression of the genotype effect is modulated by physical activity or cardiorespiratory fitness level. Our study provides an illustrative example of how physical activity and fitness level modifies the associations between a candidate gene and outcome phenotype.",

Analysis of these markers evidenced differences among IBD patients and healthy controls. Allele (CCTTT) 13 is related to higher UC risk (p = 0.001; odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval, CI] = 1.64 [1.20-2.23]). Carriers of minor alleles of the two promoter SNPs analyzed showed an association with UC predisposition, and common allele homozygotes of the two exonic SNPs were more frequent among CD patients than among controls. Concordantly, one out of the three haplotypes carrying both exonic risk alleles was found to increase CD susceptibility (p = 0.007; OR [95%CI] = 1.74 [1.13-2.67]).

Genotyping was carried out on 617 subjects of whom 255 had lung cancer. In 2 of the 3 series, there was a significant inverse association between the 178R allele and case status (p < 0.05). In a meta-analysis, the odds ratio (95% CI) associated with the 178R allele relative to the 178K allele was 0.64 (0.45-0.92, p = 0.01) and 0.51 (0.24-1.11, p = 0.09) in fixed effects and random effects models, respectively.

This trend was particularly pronounced in heavy smokers (trend test p = 0.003), but not significant in light smokers (p = 0.73). There was no evidence of an association between rs12268840 and lung cancer risk.

Studies with knockout mice and association analysis of polymorphisms revealed that FABP2 is a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes (noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) and related traits. Relevant FABP2 promoter polymorphisms c.-80_-79insT (rs5861422), c.-136_-132delAGTAG (rs5861423), c.-168_-166delAAGinsT (rs1973598), c.-260G>A (rs6857641), c.-471G>A (rs2282688), and c.-778G>T (rs10034579) result in two haplotypes A and B, whereby B possesses two- to three-fold lower transcriptional activity than A. We show in luciferase reporter gene assays by a series of chimeric FABP2 promoter constructs in intestinal Caco-2 cells that polymorphism c.-80_-79insT essentially determines different activities of the FABP2 promoter. In accordance, in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), transcriptional factors GATA-5 and -6 bind with higher binding affinities to the FABP2 promoter region containing the -80A allele compared to B. As functional consequence, haplotype A is twice as much more activated by GATA factors than haplotype B in liver Huh7 cells. Additionally, a construct bearing the -80B allele in the background of haplotype A reversed the activity from A to B. Thus, the GATA mediated differential activation of FABP2 haplotypes depends on polymorphism c.-80_-79insT. This provides the molecular basis for the variant specific transcriptional regulation of the diabetes type 2-associated FABP2 gene.",

Four VEGFA SNPs were analysed for -2578C>A (rs699947), -460T>C (rs833061), +405G>C (rs2010963) and +936 C>T (rs3025039) loci in 138 AML patients. The +936 CC/CT genotype showed strong correlation with favourable leukaemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years (51.3%) versus with +936 CC genotype (33.6%, P = 0.03). Strong linkage disequilibrium was noted among loci -2578, -460 and +405, but not with +936. Accordingly, four haplotypes were generated based on the genotypes of -2578, -460 and +405 as follows: CTC (40.2%), CTG (35.0%), ACG (22.0%) and ATC (1.2%). The LFS and event-free survival (EFS) inversely correlated with CTG haplotype (P = 0.03 for LFS; P = 0.05 for EFS). We scored the VEGFA polymorphism marker based on +936 C>T genotype and CTG haplotype for -2578, -460 and +405, which demonstrated a good correlation with the treatment outcomes: LFS (P = 0.01), EFS (P = 0.03) and overall survival (P = 0.01).

Compared with subjects carrying the XRCC1 194RR genotype, those with the WW genotype had a 1.9-fold risk of bile duct cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-3.5, P(trend) = 0.03], and compared with subjects carrying the XRCC1 280RR genotype, those with the XRCC1 280H allele had a 50% reduced risk of bile duct cancer (OR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.9, P(trend) = 0.05). The effect of the R280H polymorphism persisted (P(trend) = 0.03), when all three XRCC1 polymorphisms were jointly considered in the model, a finding supported by the haplotype results (covariate-adjusted global permutation P = 0.03). We also found an inverse association between the APEX1 148E allele and gallbladder stones (P(trend) = 0.03), but no association for the OGG1 polymorphism. This study suggests that genetic variants in XRCC1 and APEX1 may alter susceptibility to biliary tract cancer and stones. Further studies are required to confirm the reported associations.",

Several lines of evidence suggest that DISC1 may be involved in susceptibility to SCZ. In this study, we investigated whether genetic polymorphisms in the coding region of DISC1 were associated with several SCZ clinical phenotypes in a Korean population. To examine any association between DISC1 and SCZ, we genotyped three clinical single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3738401, R264Q; rs3738402, L465L; rs821616, S704C) in the coding region of the DISC1 gene using the Illumina Sentrix Array Matrix chip and direct sequencing in 303 patients with SCZ and 300 healthy controls. Our case-control analysis showed that none of these SNPs was associated with SCZ. In further endophenotype stratification, however, we found a significant association between rs821616 and the poor concentration subgroup of SCZ, determined using the Operational Criteria Checklist (codominant model, p=0.015). Our results suggest that DISC1 may be a susceptibility gene for poor concentration among Korean patients with SCZ.",

In this study, we examined how the kinesin light-chain 1 (KLC1) G56836C (rs8702) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 13 affects the occurrence of MS. This genetic variant was found to be associated with cognitive disturbances and neurodegeneration, and it was presumed to affect the kinesin function. Kinesin serves as a main cytoskeleton motor protein by carrying mitochondria and the molecular apparatus of myelin basic protein synthesis. The present association analysis of this genetic variant was performed in 102 relapsing-remitting MS patients and in 207 neuroimaging alteration-free controls. The KLC1 56836CC variant proved to exert a significant protective effect on the occurrence of MS (2.0% vs. 9.7%, P < 0.02; crude OR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.04-0.82, P < 0.05; adjusted OR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.018-0.88, P < 0.05).

Common germ line variation in the CYP17 gene has been related to inconsistent results in breast and prostate cancer, with most studies focusing on the nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T27C (rs743572). We comprehensively characterized variation in CYP17 by direct sequencing of exons followed by dense genotyping across the 58 kb region around CYP17 in five racial/ethnic populations. Two blocks of strong linkage disequilibrium were identified and nine haplotype-tagging SNPs, including T27C, were chosen to predict common haplotypes (R(h)(2) >or= 0.85). These haplotype-tagging SNPs were genotyped in 8,138 prostate cancer cases and 9,033 controls, and 5,333 breast cancer cases and 7,069 controls from the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium. We observed borderline significant associations with prostate cancer for rs2486758 [TC versus TT, odds ratios (OR), 1.07; 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 1.00-1.14; CC versus TT, OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.95-1.26; P trend=0.04] and rs6892 (AG versus AA, OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.15; GG versus AA, OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.95-1.30; P trend=0.03). We also observed marginally significant associations with breast cancer for rs4919687 (GA versus GG, OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.12, AA versus GG, OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.34; P trend=0.03) and rs4919682 (CT versus CC, OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.12; TT versus CC, OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.33; P trend=0.04). Common variation at CYP17 was not associated with circulating sex steroid hormones in men or postmenopausal women. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that common germ line variation in CYP17 makes a substantial contribution to postmenopausal breast or prostate cancer susceptibility.",

The aim of this study was to identify polymorphisms on the myocardin gene and investigate possible relationships with left ventricular structure in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Eighty-four native Cretan individuals (36 patients with HCM and 48 healthy controls) were examined by direct sequencing and subsequent restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and six polymorphisms were identified in the promoter region at positions -435T>C (rs758187), -629A>T (rs8071072), -1030C>G (rs1233851), -1069A>G, -1166A>G and -1406G>A (rs976906). Allele and haplotype frequencies were not significantly different between patients and controls. However, patients carrying the [-435C;-629T] allelic variant had decreased left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT, p = 0.020) and left ventricular mass (p = 0.006) as compared with the wild-type genotype. Carrier status of this myocardin promoter allelic variant was also associated with significant lower myocardin mRNA levels in peripheral blood (p = 0.039). Thus, a myocardin promoter allelic variant existing in the normal Cretan population was associated with decreased left ventricular mass in HCM patients and decreased myocardin mRNA levels in peripheral blood. Our results may be limited by the limited sample size, but are strengthened by the genetic homogeneity of the Cretan population. Our data suggest that functional natural myocardin promoter variation might be a genetic factor contributing to inter-individual differences in the development of cardiac hypertrophy.",

In recent years, a number of groups have performed genetic association studies on long-living individuals (LLI) and young controls to identify alleles that are either positively or negatively selected in the centenarian population as consequence of a demographic pressure. Many of the reported studies have shown genetic loci associated with longevity. Of these, with the exception of APOE, none have been convincingly reproduced. We validated our populations by typing the APOE locus. In addition, we used 749 American Caucasian LLI, organized in two independent tiers and 355 American Caucasian controls in the attempt to replicate previously published findings. We tested Klotho (KL)-VS variant (rs952706), Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) I405V (rs5882), Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) Q192R (rs662), Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) -641C/A (rs2542052), Microsomal Transfer Protein (MTP) -493G/T (rs2866164) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon2 and epsilon4 isoforms, (rs7412 and rs429358) haplotypes respectively. Our results show that, at present, except for APOE, none of the selected genes show association with longevity if carefully tested in a large cohort of LLI and their controls, pointing to the need of larger populations for case-control studies in extreme longevity.",

To implement this strategy, we genotyped a highly informative ancestry marker panel of 2270 single nucleotide polymorphisms in a random population sample of African Americans (N = 1743), European Americans (N = 1000) and Mexican Americans (N = 581). We then examined the evidence for over-transmission of specific loci to cases from one of the two ancestral populations. Hypertension cases and controls were defined based on standard clinical criteria. Both case-only and case-control analyses were performed among African Americans. With the genome-wide markers we replicated the findings identified in our previous admixture mapping study on chromosomes 6 and 21 [1]. For case-control analysis we then genotyped 51 missense SNPs in 36 genes spaced across an 18.3 Mb region. Further analyses demonstrated that the missense SNP rs2272996 (or N131S) in the VNN1 gene was significantly associated with hypertension in African Americans and the association was replicated in Mexican Americans; a non-significant opposite association was observed in European Americans. This SNP also accounted for most of the evidence observed in the admixture analysis on chromosome 6. Despite these encouraging results, susceptibility loci for hypertension have been exceptionally difficult to localize and confirmation by independent studies will be necessary to establish these findings.",

Considering reported difficulties in genotyping ACE I/D and stronger associations of rs4343 than ACE I/D with plasma ACE levels in Africans, and suitability of rs4343 for allelic mRNA (cDNA) studies, we developed and validated a liquid phase assay for rs4343, which has advantage on both functional and technical grounds. We confirmed that rs4343, is in near perfect linkage disequilibrium (D'=1, r2=0.88, n=64) with ACE I/D in Europeans (A and G alleles of rs4343 marking insertion and deletion alleles of ACE I/D respectively). We then studied its association with metabolic and cardiovascular traits in 3253 British women (60-79 years old). Apart from a nominal trend of association with diastolic blood pressure (p anova=0.08; p trend=0.05), no other associations were observed. A post-hoc vascular and general phenome scan revealed no further associations. We conclude that ACE I/D is not a major determinant of metabolic and cardiovascular traits in this population. Liquid phase genotyping of SNP rs4343 may be preferable to gel based ACE I/D genotyping both for technical and functional reasons.",

We evaluated the effects of the polymorphisms with body mass index (BMI), recent use of aspirin/NSAIDs and genetic variations in genes related to insulin signaling pathways including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), and insulin-related substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1, IRS2) and the vitamin D receptor (VDR). We observed a slight reduction in colon cancer risk with the AA LEP rs2167270 genotype (OR 0.79 95% CI 0.64, 0.98) and although not reaching statistical significance, with the combined GG LEP rs2167270 and GG LEPR rs6588147 (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49, 1.02) genotypes. BMI did not interact with any of these polymorphisms to alter colon cancer risk. However, recent aspirin/NSAID use significantly interacted with both LEP polymorphisms. Likewise, variants of IGF1 and IRS2 interacted with the LEP rs2167270 polymorphism. VDR polymorphisms interacted with all LEP and LEPR polymorphisms. These data support an association between LEP and colon cancer. They also suggest that the mechanisms linking leptin to colon cancer may be independent of energy balance.",

This gene is located in the 5q31-33 complex genetic region, which shows some susceptibility factors to type 1 diabetes (T1D) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among other inflammatory conditions. Our aim was to assess the involvement on T1D and RA of IL4 polymorphisms considered individually and in combination with other polymorphisms in 5q31-33, specifically in the OCTN locus, where the L503F polymorphism has been associated with Crohn's disease and other Th1 diseases. We performed a case-control study including 316 T1D patients, 599 RA patients and 540 healthy controls, all of them corresponding to white Spanish individuals. The IL4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) -590C/T (rs2243250) and the OCTN1 exonic SNP L503F (rs1050152) were analysed in all samples. Frequency comparisons of -590C/T and stratified analysis including both cited SNPs were performed using chi-square tests. The -590C/T IL4 SNP was not found associated with T1D or RA when individual analyses were performed. However, a significant association with T1D emerged after stratification by L503F [p=0.02, odds ratio=1.95, 95% CI=1.07-3.55]. The location of the IL4 gene in the complex 5q31-33 genetic region, which contains many genes involved in immunological responses and presents linkage disequilibrium extended along many kilobases, makes necessary to interpret cautiously the previous IL4-association studies.",

Polymorphisms in the XIAP gene may influence XIAP production or activity, thereby modulating susceptibility to lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we first screened for polymorphisms in the XIAP gene by direct sequencing of genomic DNA samples from 27 healthy Korean women and then performed a case-control study to evaluate the association between the polymorphisms and the risk of lung cancer. The XIAP genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and melting curve analysis in 582 lung cancer patients and in 582 healthy control subjects who were frequency-matched for age and sex. We identified 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one novel SNP [30051C>G (A321G) in exon 3] and the following 11 known SNPs: 192G>C (rs5956578), 262C>T (rs28382699), 318C>T (rs5958318), and 374C>T (rs12687176) in the putative promoter; 26615A>G (rs2355676) in intron 1; 41725A>G (rs5958338) in intron 5; 42009A>C (Q423P, rs5956583) in exon 6; 48162T>C (rs17334739) and 48228C>T (rs28382739) in intron 6; and 48542A>G (rs28382740) and 49333G>T (rs28382742) in 3'-UTR. Four of these 12 SNPs were selected for large-scale genotyping based on their frequencies and haplotype tagging status: 262C>T, 318C>T, 374C>T, and 42009A>C. The four XIAP polymorphisms and their haplotypes exhibited no apparent relationship with the risk of lung cancer. In addition, we observed no evidence of effect modification by age, sex, smoking history, or tumor histology.

Genotype frequencies in cases and controls were compared using logistic regression. The only SNP we found to be associated with ovarian cancer risk in both of these two studies was SRD5A2 V89L (rs523349), which showed a significant trend of increasing risk per rare allele (P = 0.00002). We then genotyped another SNP in this gene (rs632148; r(2) = 0.945 with V89L) in an attempt to validate this finding in an independent set of 1,479 cases and 2,452 controls from United Kingdom, United States, and Denmark. There was no association between rs632148 and ovarian cancer risk in the validation samples, and overall, there was no significant heterogeneity between the results of the five studies. Further analyses of SNPs in this gene are therefore warranted to determine whether SRD5A2 plays a role in ovarian cancer predisposition.",

The aetiology of this condition is still not fully understood. Several gene variations in the FSH receptor (FSHR) gene have been identified for the very rare cases of spontaneous OHSS. There are only few published data on gene variations in sterility and iatrogenic OHSS and no data regarding aromatase (cytochrome P450 19A1; CYP19A1). Ninety-one ART patients with OHSS, eighty-eight ART patients without OHSS and ninety-seven women with assumed normal fecundity were analysed for the FSHR single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) gene variations Asn680Ser (rs6166), Ala189Val, Ile160Thr, Thr449Ile (rs28928870) and the CYP19A1 rs10046 locus using real-time PCR. In addition, exon 10 of FSHR of two patients with spontaneous hyperreactio luteinalis (HL) was sequenced. Significantly lower frequencies of homozygous Ser680/Ser680 (P=0.035) and heterozygous Thr160/Ile160 (P=0.039) were found in patients with normal fecundity than those undergoing ART. The Ile160Thr SNP with a frequency of 6.7 and 6.1% in ART patients with and without OHSS respectively does not represent a rare mutation as previously published. There were no differences in the frequencies of all other gene variations. Of two patients with HL, both had homozygous point mutations for Ser680/Ser680 and one was heterozygous for Ile160Thr and CYP19A1 rs10046. The FSHR gene variations Asn680Ser as well as Ile160Thr may be contributing factors in unexplained sterility. The other FSHR coding gene variations and CYP19A1 rs10046 investigated are most likely not involved in the aetiology of iatrogenic OHSS or sterility.",

The objective of the study was to clarify whether Pro12Ala polymorphism was related to the serum OPG levels and bone mineral metabolism in healthy Korean women. In 239 Korean women (mean age 51 years), who participated in medical check-up program in a health promotion center, anthropometric measurements, lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover markers, such as serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, urine deoxypyridinoline levels, and 24-h urine calcium excretion were measured. Serum levels of OPG were measured with ELISA method. DNAs were extracted from the samples and the genotyping of the Pro12Ala polymorphism (rs1801282) in the PPAR-gamma gene was performed via an allelic discrimination assay using a TaqMan probe. In addition, we examined the haplotype analysis between two polymorphisms of PPAR-gamma gene, Pro12Ala in exon B and C161T in exon 6 (rs3856806). Allelic frequencies were 0.950 for Pro allele and 0.050 for Ala allele, which was in compliance with Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium, and there was no Ala12Ala genotype among the genotyped subjects. Mean serum OPG level was significantly lower (P=0.035), and serum total ALP was significantly higher (P=0.014) in the Pro12Ala genotype group compared with the Pro12Pro genotype group, which were consistently significant even after adjustment for weight, height, and serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In multiple regression analysis with serum OPG as the dependent variable and age, weight, ALP, femoral neck BMD and Pro12Ala genotype included in the model, only Pro12Ala genotype was significant determinant of serum OPG level (b=??0.136, P=0.035). The haplotype analysis with C161T polymorphism revealed that subjects with Ala and T alleles showed significantly lower serum OPG levels compared with those with Pro12Pro/CC genotype, which were consistently significant even after adjustment for age, weight, height and FSH (P=0.010). This result suggests statistically significant association of Pro12Ala polymorphisms with serum OPG levels in Korean females.",

Filaggrin (FLG) is a key protein that facilitates the terminal differentiation of the epidermis. Thus, FLG genetic variants may modify the risk of psoriasis. In total, 314 patients with psoriasis and 611 control subjects were analyzed for the presence of FLG R501X, 2282del4 mutations, and P478S (rs11584340, C/T base change) polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The analysis revealed that both the R501X and 2282del4 mutations were not present in a subset of 200 patients (64%) with psoriasis. In contrast, a marginally significant difference (P = 0.020) was found in the distribution of rs11584340 genotype frequencies between psoriatic patients and controls. The frequency of the TT genotype in psoriasis patients was significantly higher than in controls (37.9% vs. 29.1%, respectively, P = 0.007). The T allele frequency of patients (60.5%) was also significantly higher than that of controls (53.9%) (P = 0.007). After adjusting for age and gender, carriers of the TT genotype were 1.46 (95% CI, 1.08-1.96) times more likely than non-carriers to have psoriasis (P = 0.013). In conclusion, our results suggest that FLG P478S polymorphism may confer susceptibility to the development of psoriasis among Taiwanese Chinese.",

Inhibition of GSK3B is thought to be a key feature in the therapeutic mechanism of antidepressants. To investigate whether common genetic variants in the GSK3B gene are associated with MDD and the therapeutic response to antidepressants, four polymorphisms (rs334558 (-50 T>C), rs13321783 (IVS7+9227 A>G), rs2319398 (IVS7+11660 G>T) and rs6808874 (IVS11+4251 T>A)) of the GSK3B gene were genotyped in 230 Chinese MDD patients and 415 controls. Among the MDD patients, 168 accepted selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (fluoxetine or citalopram) antidepressant treatment and therapeutic evaluation for 4 weeks and 117 for 8 weeks. Significant association with MDD was not shown in the alleles and genotypes of single loci or four-locus haplotypes. However, three of the four polymorphisms investigated were significantly associated with 4-week antidepressant therapeutic effect (P=0.002-0.011). Of the four-locus haplotype analysis, the GSK3B TAGT carriers showed a poorer response to antidepressants in 4-week (P<0.0001) and 8-week (P=0.015) evaluation compared with other haplotype groups and would quite likely be the non-remitter to 8-week antidepressant treatment (P=0.006). Our findings show, for the first time, that GSK3B genetic variants play a role in the SSRI antidepressant therapeutic response and support the hypothesis that drugs regulating GSK3B activity may represent a novel treatment strategy for MDD.",

Prenatal folate supplementation reduces the risk of neural tube defects and probably oral facial clefts. Previous studies of related metabolic genes have associated polymorphisms in cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with cleft risk. We explored associations between genes related to one-carbon metabolism and clefts in a Norwegian population-based study that included 362 families with cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and 191 families with cleft palate only (CPO). We previously showed a 39% reduction in risk of CL/P with folic acid supplementation in this population. In the present study we genotyped 12 polymorphisms in nine genes related to one-carbon metabolism and looked for associations of clefting risk with fetal polymorphisms, maternal polymorphisms, as well as parent-of-origin effects, using combined likelihood-ratio tests (LRT). We also stratified by maternal periconceptional intake of folic acid (>400 microg) to explore gene-exposure interactions. We found a reduced risk of CL/P with mothers who carried the CBS C699T variant (rs234706); relative risk was 0.94 with one copy of the T allele (95% CI 0.63-1.4) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.26-0.96) with two copies (P = 0.008). We found no evidence of interaction of this variant with folate status. We saw no evidence of risk from the MTHFR C677T variant (rs1801133) either overall or after stratifying by maternal folate intake. No associations were found between any of the polymorphisms and CPO. Genetic variations in the nine metabolic genes examined here do not confer a substantial degree of risk for clefts.",

We replicated the association in four independent case-control sets (combined P = 3.7 x 10(-10); OR = 1.38). We analyzed BANK1 cDNA and found two isoforms, one full-length and the other alternatively spliced and lacking exon 2 (Delta2), encoding a protein without a putative IP3R-binding domain. The transcripts were differentially expressed depending on a branch point-site SNP, rs17266594, in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs10516487. A third associated variant was found in the ankyrin domain (rs3733197, A383T).

In this study, we determined whether polymorphisms in these genes modified the effect of changes in physical activity (PA) on the risk of T2D in the DPS. Moreover, we assessed whether the polymorphisms modified the effect of changes in PA on changes in measures of body fat, serum lipids, and blood pressure during the first year of the follow-up of the DPS. Overweight subjects with IGT (n = 487) were followed for an average of 4.1 years, and PA was assessed annually with a questionnaire. The interactions of the polymorphisms with changes in total and moderate-to-vigorous PA on the conversion to T2D during the 4.1-year follow-up were assessed using Cox regression with adjustments for the other components of the intervention (dietary changes, weight reduction). Univariate analysis of variance was used to assess interactions on changes in continuous variables during the first year of the follow-up. No interaction between the polymorphisms and PA on the conversion to T2D was found. The Leu72Met (rs696217) polymorphism in GHRL modified the effect of moderate-to-vigorous PA on changes in weight and waist circumference, the -501A/C (rs26802) polymorphism in GHRL modified the effect of total and moderate-to-vigorous PA on change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the Lys109Arg (rs1137100) polymorphism in LEPR modified the effect of total PA on change in blood pressure. In conclusion, genetic variation may modify the magnitude of the beneficial effects of PA on characteristics of the metabolic syndrome in persons with IGT.",

In the present work, we describe additional fine association mapping of eye color SNPs in the intergenic region upstream of OCA2 and within the neighboring HERC2 (hect domain and RLD2) gene. We screened an additional 92 SNPs in 300-3000 European individuals and found that a single SNP in intron 86 of HERC2, rs12913832, predicted eye color significantly better (ordinal logistic regression R(2) = 0.68, association LOD = 444) than our previous best OCA2 haplotype. Comparison of sequence alignments of multiple species showed that this SNP lies in the center of a short highly conserved sequence and that the blue-eye-associated allele (frequency 78%) breaks up this conserved sequence, part of which forms a consensus binding site for the helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF). We were also able to demonstrate the OCA2 R419Q, rs1800407, coding SNP acts as a penetrance modifier of this new HERC2 SNP for eye color, and somewhat independently, of melanoma risk. We conclude that the conserved region around rs12913832 represents a regulatory region controlling constitutive expression of OCA2 and that the C allele at rs12913832 leads to decreased expression of OCA2, particularly within iris melanocytes, which we postulate to be the ultimate cause of blue eye color.",

Low-penetrance alleles of genes in many biological pathways, such as DNA repair, metabolism, inflammation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and Wnt signaling, may influence the risk of nonfamilial colorectal cancer. To identify susceptibility genes for colorectal cancer, we designed a large-scale case-control association study nested within the Nurses' Health Study (190 cases and 190 controls) and the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study (168 cases and 168 controls). We used a custom GoldenGate (Illumina) oligonucleotide pool assay including 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) selected in candidate genes from cancer-related pathways, which have been sequenced and genotyped in the SNP500Cancer project; 1,412 of the 1,536 (92%) of the SNPs were genotyped successfully within 388 genes. SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (r(2) >/= 0.90) with another assayed SNP were excluded from further analyses. As expected by chance (and not significant compared with a corrected Bonferroni P = 0.00004), in the additive model, 11 of 1,253 (0.9%) SNPs had a P(trend) < 0.01 and 38 of 1,253 (3.0%) SNPs had a P(trend) >/= 0.01 and P(trend) < 0.05. Of note, the MGMT Lys(178)Arg (rs2308237) SNP, in linkage disequilibrium with the previously reported MGMT Ile(143)Val SNP, had an inverse association with colorectal cancer risk (MGMT Lys(178)Arg: odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.78; unadjusted P(trend) = 0.0003 for the additive model; gene-based test global P = 0.00003).

Lip pits and missing teeth are the only additional features distinguishing the syndrome from isolated clefts. Van der Woude syndrome, therefore, provides an excellent model for studying the isolated forms of clefting. From a population-based case-control study of facial clefts in Norway (1996-2001), we selected 377 cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P), 196 cleft palate only (CPO), and 763 control infant-parent triads for analysis. We genotyped six single nucleotide polymorphisms within the IRF6 locus and estimated the relative risks (RR) conferred on the child by alleles and haplotypes of the child and of the mother. On the whole, there were strong statistical associations with CL/P but not CPO in our data. In single-marker analyses, mothers with a double-dose of the 'a'-allele at rs4844880 had an increased risk of having a child with CL/P (RR=1.85, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-3.25; P=0.036). An RR of 0.38 (95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.92; P=0.031) was obtained when the child carried a single-dose of the 'a'-allele at rs2235371 (the p.V274I polymorphism). The P-value for the overall test was <0.001. In haplotype analyses, several of the fetal and maternal haplotype relative risks were statistically significant individually but were not strong enough to show up on the overall test (P=0.113). Taken together, these findings further support a role for IRF6 variants in clefting of the lip and provide specific risk estimates in a Norwegian population.",

To assess whether alterations in other DNA repair genes contribute to breast cancer and to further determine the relevance of these genes to pancreatic cancer, we performed mutational analysis of 32 DNA double-strand break repair genes in genomic DNA from 38 breast tumors, 48 pancreatic tumors, and 10 non-BRCA1/BRCA2 hereditary breast cancer patients. A total of 494 coding exons were screened by denatured high-performance liquid chromatography and direct DNA sequencing. Two inactivating mutations were identified in breast tumor samples, a germline single-nucleotide deletion in POLQ (c.3605delT) and a somatic nonsense change in PRKDC (c.2408C>A, p.Ser803X). Two germline-inactivating mutations in RAD50 (c.1875C>G, p.Tyr625X and IVS14+1G>A) were also detected in separate pancreatic tumor samples. In addition, 35 novel nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions, resulting from two in-frame deletions and 33 single nucleotide alterations, were identified. Seven of these were predicted to influence protein function. A separate analysis of the CLSPN c.3839C>T (rs35490896) variant that was observed more frequently in breast tumors than in pancreatic tumors or normal controls failed to detect a significant association with breast cancer risk in a Mayo Clinic breast cancer case-control study. In conclusion, this screen of DNA repair genes implicates PRKDC and POLQ as candidate tumor suppressor genes involved in breast cancer and suggests that inactivating mutations in RAD50 predispose to pancreatic cancer as well as breast cancer.",

The APOB T-T haplotype (APOB IVS6+360C>T, EX4+56C>T) was associated with a 1.6-fold risk of bile duct cancer (95% CI, 1.1-2.3). Male and female carriers of the T allele of LDLR IVS9-30C>T (rs1003723) had a 1.5-fold risk of bile duct cancer. Our findings suggest that gene variants in the lipid metabolism pathway contribute to the risk of biliary tract stones and cancers, particularly of the bile duct.",

Cancer Res. 13, 7207-7216 (2007). Genetic variations in the glutathione S-transferases GSTT1 and GSTM1 have been studied in many human populations, and association of these variations with environmentally-related cancers, drug-induced hepatotoxicity and even chronification of viral hepatitis has been shown. However, studies carried out to date have been limited to gene deletion, designated as null alleles, and no extensive studies on other types of genetic variations have been carried out. This study is of great importance, as it describes the occurrence and the allele frequencies for 18 SNPs in the GSTT1 gene, including four nonsynonymous SNPs, and 69 SNPs, two of which are nonsynonymous, in the GSTM1 gene. The GSTT1 SNPs leading to the amino acid substitutions Asp43Asn, Thr65Met, Thr104Pro and a single nucleotide deletion in exon 4 cause a decrease in immunoreactive protein. Interestingly, the previously described nonsynonymous GSTT1 SNPs rs2266635 (Ala21Thr), rs11550606 (Leu30Pro), rs17856199 (Phe45Cys), rs11550605 (Thr104Pro), rs2266633 (Asp141Asn) and rs2234953 (Glu173Lys) were not identified in 400 subjects, thus indicating that these variant alleles are expected to occur at extremely low frequencies. This study reinforces the need to combine SNP databases and resequencing. On combining the data reported in this study with SNP databases, the most promising target SNPs for GSTT1 association studies are those causing the amino acid changes Asp43Asn, Thr65Met, Thr104Pro and the single nucleotide deletion in exon 4. These gene variants should be analyzed in African-American and Hispanic subjects to increase the predictive capacity of genetic tests. For Caucasians and Oriental subjects, testing for null alleles seems to be sufficient.",

Mutations in the human cardiac sodium channel alpha-subunit gene (SCN5A) are involved in the pathophysiology of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. This study was performed to compare the frequency of SCN5A variants in LVNC patients with or without arrhythmias, and to investigate the relationship between variants and disease severity. DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood of 62 Japanese probands with LVNC, comprising 17 familial cases and 45 sporadic cases. Blood samples were screened for variants in SCN5A using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. Seven variants, rs6599230:G > A, c.453C > T, c.1141-3C > A, rs1805124:A > G (p.H558R), rs1805125:C > T (p.P1090L), c.3996C > T, and rs1805126:T > C were identified in 7 familial and 12 sporadic cases. The frequency of SCN5A variants was significantly higher in the patients with arrhythmias than those without (50% vs 7%: P = 0.0003), suggesting these variants represent a risk factor for arrhythmia and supporting the hypothesis that genes encoding ion channels are involved in LVNC pathophysiology. The LVNC patients with heart failure also had high occurrence of SCN5A variants, suggesting the presence of SCN5A variants and/or arrhythmias increase the severity of LVNC.",

                "text": "American journal of human genetics\nLumbar-disc herniation (LDH), one of the most common musculoskeletal diseases, has strong genetic determinants. Recently, several genes that encode extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the intervertebral disc have been reported to associate with LDH. Thrombospondins (THBSs) 1 and 2 are good candidates for the LDH susceptibility gene: They are intervertebral disc ECM proteins that regulate the effective levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9, which are key effectors of ECM remodeling. Here, we report that THBS2 is associated with LDH in Japanese populations. An intronic SNP in THBS2 (IVS10-8C --> T; rs9406328) showed significant association (p = 0.0000028) with LDH in two independent Japanese populations. This SNP, located in a polypyrimidine tract upstream of the 3' splice site of intron 10, exerts allelic differences on exon 11 skipping rates in vivo, with the susceptibility allele showing increased skipping. Skipping of exon 11 results in decreased THBS2 interaction with MMP2 and MMP9. Further, a missense SNP in MMP9 (Q279R; rs17576) is also strongly associated with LDH in the Japanese population (p = 0.00049) and shows a combinatorial effect with THBS2 (odds ratio 3.03, 95% confidence interval 1.58-5.77). Thus, a splicing-affecting SNP in THBS2 and a missense SNP in MMP9 are associated with susceptibility to LDH. Our data indicate that regulation of intervertebral disc ECM metabolism by the THBS2-MMP system plays an essential role in the etiology and pathogenesis of LDH.",

                "text": "Human mutation\nPrimary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused predominantly by mutations in the CYP1B1 gene. A total of five frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the coding sequence of CYP1B1: rs10012C>G (p.R48G), rs1056827G>T (p.A119S), rs1056836C>G (p.V432L), rs1056837C>T (p.D449D), and rs1800440A>G (p.N453S). We performed a functional characterization of four common CYP1B1 variants presenting different coding SNP haplotypes (RAVDN, GSLDN, RALDS, and RALDN) and five CYP1B1 mutations reported for PCG patients: c.182G>A (p.G61E), c.608A>G (p.N203S), c.1033_1035del (p.L343del), c.241 T>A (p.Y81N), and c.685G>A (p.E229 K). Each mutation was embedded in its corresponding background SNP haplotype. The common variants revealed variation in enzymatic activity; among them, RAVDN showed the highest activity. Mutants p.G61E, p.N203S, and p.L343del each revealed a residual activity (<10%) of their respective haplotype. The microsomal CYP1B1 abundance relative to total protein also showed variation in common variants and a significant reduction in p.L343del, p.Y81N, and p.E229 K. The free energy of folding (DeltaDeltaG) values suggest that the lower stability of the mutants is one key property leading to the experimentally observed lower protein abundance. Our new measure of relative enzymatic activity (U/mg total protein), which combines activity and abundance values, was significantly lower for all five mutations compared to the corresponding background haplotype. We classified p.Y81N and p.E229 K not as mutations but as hypomorphic alleles, since their relative activity values are intermediate between bona fide mutations and the common variant with the lowest activity (RALDS). We propose that CYP1B1 mutations can act by either reducing enzymatic activity (p.G61E and p.N203S), reducing the abundance of the enzyme (p.Y81N and p.E229 K), or both (p.L343del).",
