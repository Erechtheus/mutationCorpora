                "text": "<b>Background</b>: Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and the antidepressant response. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is reported to increase BDNF levels in blood, though only a small number of studies have been conducted to date.\n<b>Objective</b>: Our objectives were to: 1) compare plasma BDNF levels in medicated patients with depression and controls; 2) assess the effect of ECT on plasma BDNF levels in medicated patients with depression; 3) explore the relationship between plasma BDNF levels and the Val66Met (rs6265) BDNF polymorphism; and 4) examine the relationship between plasma BDNF levels and clinical symptoms and outcomes with ECT.\n<b>Methods</b>: Plasma BDNF levels were analyzed in samples from 61 medicated patients with a major depressive episode and 50 healthy controls, and in patient samples following a course of ECT. Fifty-two samples from the depressed patient group were genotyped for the Val66Met BDNF polymorphism.\n<b>Results</b>: There was no difference in plasma BDNF levels between the control and depressed groups, and there was no difference in plasma BDNF levels in patients following treatment with ECT. In line with previous reports, we show that, in medicated patients with depression, Met-carriers had higher plasma BDNF levels than Val-carriers, though genotype was not related to clinical response. We found no association between plasma BDNF levels and depression severity or the clinical response to ECT.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our results suggest that plasma BDNF does not represent a suitable candidate biomarker for determining the therapeutic response to ECT.",

Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue. The polymorphisms were analyzed using direct DNA-sequencing or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).\n<b>Results</b>: GSTP1-Ile105Val (rs1695) was significantly associated with DFS and OS and its effect did not vary by treatment arm. The five-year DFS and OS were 53% and 58%, respectively, for G/G, 66% and 72% for G/A, and 57% and 66% for A/A patients. In arm 2, IL8-251A/A genotype (rs4073) was associated with a lower risk of toxicities (P = 0.04). The VEGFR2 H472Q Q/Q genotype (rs1870377) was associated with a higher risk of grade 3-5 proximal upper gastrointestinal tract (PUGIT) mucositis (P = 0.04) in arm 2. However, in arm 1, this genotype was associated with a lower risk of PUGIT mucositis (P = 0.004).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: rs1695 may be prognostic in patients with rectal cancer treated with adjuvant CRT. rs4073 and rs1870377 may exhibit different associations with toxicity, according to the 5-FU schedule.",

In addition, p.N363S (rs6195), p.ER22/23EK (rs6189-6190), and BclI (rs41423247) SNPs were evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction allelic discrimination. Exons 3 to 9 and exon/intron boundaries of NR3C1 were sequenced. GR isoforms and cytokines (IL1B, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1) expression were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.\n<b>Results</b>: Plasma and salivary cortisol (nmol/L) after 1-mg DEX were higher in MetS patients compared with controls (PF: 70.2 \u00b1 17.3 vs 37.9 \u00b1 2.6, P = .02, and SF: 4.9 \u00b1 1.7 vs 2.2 \u00b1 0.3, P < .0001). After all DEX doses, a lower number of MetS patients suppressed plasma and salivary cortisol compared with controls. The BclI genotypic frequencies (%) differed between patients (CC:56/CG:44) and controls (CC:50/CG:32.5/GG:17.5) (P = .03). The GR\u03b2 was overexpressed (fold = 100.0; P = .002) and IL4 (fold = -265.0; P < .0001) was underexpressed in MetS.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: MetS patients exhibited decreased HPA sensitivity to glucocorticoid feedback. Moreover, the BclI polymorphism lower frequency, GR\u03b2 overexpression, and IL4 underexpression might underlie the molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid resistance in MetS. Thus, HPA axis dysregulation might contribute to MetS pathogenesis.",

Genotyping of the -1082 G/A (rs1800896), -819 T/C (rs1800871) and -592 A/C (rs1800872) SNPs was conducted and genotype frequencies were compared between the two groups.\n<b>Results</b>: The study recruited 364 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 677 healthy controls. Patients carrying the -1082 GG genotype had a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 2.68), as did those patients carrying the -592 AA genotype (adjusted OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.06, 2.53). Subjects carrying both the -1082 GA + GG and -592 AC + AA genotypes had a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.24, 3.15).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The SNPs -1082G/A and -592 A/C increased the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, and could be potential targets for screening for the early detection of the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

The study with 260 patients and 150 controls was conducted in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. The genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP. The A allele and A/A genotype of <i>IL17A</i> were significantly increased in patients and their subgroups (patients with CCC; patients with CCC and LVSD; and patients with CCC and severe LVSD) when compared to the control group. The analysis according to the gender showed that the A/A genotype of <i>IL17A</i> was more frequent in female with LVSD and mild to moderate LVSD and also in male patients with LVSD. The frequency of <i>IL17F</i> T/C genotype was higher in male patients with CCC and severe LVSD and in female with mild to moderate LVSD. The results suggest the possible involvement of the polymorphisms of <i>IL17A</i> and <i>IL17F</i> in the susceptibility to chronic Chagas disease and in development and progression of cardiomyopathy.",

We studied a middle-aged/elderly sample of 4,193 nondiabetic Japanese subjects stratified according gender (1,911 women and 2,282 men). The LEPR Gln223Arg (rs1137101) variant as well as both ADRB2 Arg16Gly (rs1042713) and Gln27Glu (rs1042714) polymorphisms were analyzed. The primary outcome was the risk of overweight/obesity defined as BMI \u226525 kg/m(2), whereas secondary outcomes included the risk of a BMI \u226527 kg/m(2) and BMI as a continuous variable. None of the studied polymorphisms showed statistically significant individual effects, regardless of the group or phenotype studied. Haplotype analysis also did not disclose any associations of ADRB2 polymorphisms with BMI. However, dimensionality reduction-based models confirmed significant interactions among the investigated variants for BMI as a continuous variable as well as for the risk of obesity defined as BMI \u226527 kg/m(2). All disclosed interactions were found in men only. Our results provide external validation for a male specific ADRB2-LEPR interaction effect on the risk of overweight/obesity, but indicate that effect sizes associated with these interactions may be smaller in the population studied.",

Because the endocannabinoid system is deeply involved in BW regulation, endocannabinoid genes may have a role in the antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Therefore, we investigated the 1359 G/A (rs1049353) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) gene, which codes the endocannabinoid CB1 receptor, and the complementary DNA (cDNA) 385C/A (rs324420) SNP of the FAAH gene, which codes the endocannabinoid degrading enzyme, for their role in BW changes induced by antipsychotic drugs. Eighty-three white psychotic patients who underwent a naturalistic treatment with different antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and haloperidol) and completed a 24-week treatment period were included into the study together with 80 age- and sex-matched white healthy controls. At the 24th week of treatment, 41 patients gained more than 7% of their baseline BW. No significant differences between patients and controls emerged in genotype and allele frequencies of both SNPs. Genotype and allele frequencies of the FAAH cDNA 385C/A SNP but not of the CNR1 1359 G/A SNP significantly differed between subjects who gained more than 7% of BW and those who did not, with both AC and AA genotypes and the A allele being significantly more frequent in patients who gained more than 7% of their baseline BW. Present findings, although obtained in a small population and in a naturalistic setting, suggest that the cDNA 385C/A SNP of the FAAH gene may predispose subjects to get a clinically meaningful weight gain after antipsychotic exposure.",

In North European populations, its common functional variant Q62R (rs35927125) is a strong genetic factor for Type 2 diabetes (P = 0.00033, odds ratio for G allele = 1.29, 95% CI 1.12-1.49). We examined the contribution of KLF11 variants to the susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes in a Japanese population.\n<b>Methods</b>: By re-sequencing Japanese individuals (n = 24, partly 96), we screened all four exons, exon/intron boundaries and flanking regions of KLF11. Verified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 731 initial samples (369 control and 362 case subjects). Subsequently, we tested for association in 1087 samples (524 control and 563 case subjects), which were collected in different districts of Japan from the initial samples.\n<b>Results</b>: We identified eight variants, including a novel A/C variant on intron 3, but no mis-sense mutations. In an association study, we failed to find any significant result of SNPs (minor allele frequency 8.2-46.2%) after correcting for multiple testing. Similarly, no haplotypes were associated with Type 2 diabetes. It is notable that the G allele in rs35927125 was completely absent in 1818 Japanese individuals.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Genetic variants in KLF11 are unlikely to have a major effect of Type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population, although they were significantly associated in North European populations. These observations might help to determine the role of KLF11 variants in Type 2 diabetes in different populations.",

                "text": "Luteinizing hormone (LH) is a pituitary heterodimeric glycoprotein essential in male and female reproduction. Its functional polymorphic variant (V-LH) is determined by two missense mutations (rs1800447, A/G, Trp8Arg; rs34349826, A/G, Ile15Thr) in the LH \u03b2-subunit encoding gene (LHB; 19q13.3; 1111 bp; 3 exons). Among women, V-LH has been associated with higher circulating LH and reduced fertility, but the knowledge of its effect on male reproductive parameters has been inconclusive. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of V-LH on hormonal, seminal and testicular parameters in the Baltic young men cohort (n = 986; age: 20.1 \u00b1 2.1 years) and Estonian idiopathic infertility patients (n = 607; 35.1 \u00b1 5.9 years). V-LH was detected by genotyping of the underlying DNA polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP combined with resequencing of a random subset of subjects. Genetic associations were tested using linear regression under additive model and results were combined in meta-analysis. No significant difference was detected between young men and infertility patients for the V-LH allele frequency (11.0 vs. 9.3%, respectively). V-LH was associated with higher serum LH in both, the young men cohort (p = 0.022, allelic effect = 0.26 IU/L) and the idiopathic infertility group (p = 0.008, effect = 0.59 IU/L). In meta-analysis, the statistical significance was enhanced (p = 0.0007, resistant to Bonferroni correction for multiple testing; effect = 0.33 IU/L). The detected significant association of V-LH with increased serum LH remained unchanged after additional adjustment for the SNPs previously demonstrated to affect LH levels (FSHB -211G/T, FSHR Asn680Ser, FSHR -29A/G). Additionally, a suggestive trend for association with reduced testicular volume was observed among young men, and with lower serum FSH among infertility patients. The V-LH carrier status did not affect sperm parameters and other circulating reproductive hormones. For the first time, we show a conclusive contribution of V-LH to the natural variance in male serum LH levels. Its downstream clinical consequences are still to be learned.",

Due to the complex initiation and intricate progression mechanisms, early detection and effective treatment of gastric cancer are both difficult to achieve. The genetic polymorphisms encoding critical protein cyclin D1 (CCND1) to regulate cell cycle transition from G1 phase to S phase may determine the susceptibility of individuals to gastric cancer. The study aimed to examine the contribution of CCND1 genotypes to gastric cancer risk in Taiwan.\n<b>Materials And Methods</b>: The genotypes of CCND1 A870G (rs9344) and G1722C (rs678653) were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis among 358 gastric patients and 358 cancer-free controls, and the distribution of genotypic and allelic frequencies among the two groups were compared.\n<b>Results</b>: The results showed that there were significant differences between gastric cancer and control groups in the distribution of the genotypes (p=6.86\u00d710(-4)) and allelic frequency (p=0.0016) in the CCND1 A870G genotype. In addition, individuals who carried the AG or GG genotype had 0.55- and 0.51-fold of odds ratios of developing gastric cancer compared to those who carried the AA genotype (95% confidence intervals [CI]=0.39-0.76 and 0.32-0.81, respectively). There was no such association of CCND1 G1722C with gastric cancer. Furthermore, there was an obvious interaction of the CCND1 A870G genotype with personal smoking habit on gastric cancer risk (p=0.0005).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Cell-cycle regulation may play a role in gastric cancer initiation and development and the CCND1 A870G genotype maybe a useful biomarker for detection of early gastric cancer.",

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the standard treatment for KD; however, ~15% of patients are resistant to IVIG treatment. To identify protein coding genetic variants influencing IVIG resistance, we re-analyzed our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from 296 patients with KD, including 101 IVIG non-responders and 195 IVIG responders. Five nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in five immune-related genes, including a previously reported SAMD9L nsSNP (rs10488532; p.Val266Ile), were associated with IVIG non-response (odds ratio [OR] = 1.89-3.46, P = 0.0109-0.0035). In a replication study of the four newly-identified nsSNPs, only one in the interleukin 16 (IL16) gene (rs11556218, p.Asn1147Lys) showed a trend of association with IVIG non-response (OR = 1.54, P = 0.0078). The same IL16 nsSNP was more significantly associated with IVIG non-response in combined analysis of all data (OR = 1.64, P = 1.25 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup>). Furthermore, risk allele combination of the IL16 CT and SAMD9L TT nsSNP genotypes exhibited a very strong effect size (OR = 9.19, P = 3.63 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup>). These results implicate IL16 as involved in the mechanism of IVIG resistance in KD.",

In continuation of the analysis of CFH and LOC387715/HTRA1, this study was conducted to gain understanding of the role of CFB and C2 in an Indian AMD cohort.\n<b>Methods</b>: Single nucleotide polymorphisms in CFB and C2 were screened in a cohort of clinically well-characterized patients with AMD (n = 177) and unaffected normal control subjects (n = 175). Screening was accomplished by a combination of customized genotyping followed by validation through resequencing. In addition, genotyping of two CFB variants (rs12614 and rs641153) that were in close proximity had to be resolved by resequencing. Estimates of allele and genotype frequencies, odds ratios, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and haplotype frequencies were also performed.\n<b>Results</b>: Three SNPs in C2 (rs547154 [IVS10]; P = 5.4 x 10(-11)) and CFB (rs641153 [R32Q], P = 2.2 x 10(-7) and rs2072633 [IVS17]; P = 2.0 x 10(-4)) were strongly associated with reduced risk of AMD. The rs547154 and rs641153 were in strong LD (D' = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.81-0.96) and a protective haplotype T-A was observed (OR = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.05-0.20). LD was moderate (D' = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.67-0.85) between the rs547154 and the rs2072633 SNPs, and the haplotype T-T generated with these SNPs was relatively less protective (OR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.18-0.44).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The results of the present study provide an independent validation of the association of rs547154 (C2) and rs641153 (CFB) SNPs with reduced risk of AMD in an Indian cohort.",

Plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines; IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were measured by sandwich Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).\n<b>Results</b>: Allele frequency spectrum after adjusting the effect of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG) and body mass index (BMI) revealed that major allele G of rs1800795 and T of rs10499563 were significantly associated with increased risk of OA (P < 0.01) in all the three genetic models; co-dominant (OR 4.08 &amp; 4.12, P < 0.001), recessive (OR 3.00 &amp; 2.51, P < 0.001) and dominant (OR 2.56 &amp; 3.09, P < 0.05). Major allele G of rs1800796 and rs1800797 was observed to enhance OA risk in recessive mode (OR 1.75, P < 0.001 &amp; 1.62, P = 0.01 respectively). Disease risk analysis after adjusting the effect of confounders exposed a susceptibility haplotype GGGGCT, which increased the OA risk by 2.27 times (OR 2.27, 95%CI: 1.26-4.10, P = 0.009) and a protective haplotype CGAGGC which significantly reduced the OA risk (OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.27-0.92, P = 0.031). Both of these haplotypes manifested in the recessive mode of inheritance. Subjects who had one copy of the susceptibility haplotype had lower values of IL-6 (3.6 pg/ml) and IL-1\u03b2 levels (3.2 pg/ml) than those who had 2 copies of it (4.4 pg/ml &amp; 4.2 pg/ml respectively). IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 levels were observed to be negatively associated with protective haplotype CGAGGC (P < 0.05). Carriers of 1 copy of this haplotype showed decreased IL-1\u03b2 levels than those who had none (1.00 pg/ml vs. 1.3 pg/ml respectively) which further decreased to 0.9 pg/ml in those subjects who carried two copies of protective haplotype.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: The present study discovered susceptibility (GGGGCT) and protective (CGAGGC) haplotypes within promoter region of IL-6 gene which influenced the plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 for the risk of osteoarthritis in the population of Punjab, India.",

                "text": "Objective One of the most important problems in human reproduction is recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). RPL is defined as three or more consecutive abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy. The association between the polymorphisms in the immunological factors and RPL was investigated. The aim of our study was to determine the association of interleukin receptor antagonist (IL-IRN) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) polymorphisms with RPL in Iranian Azeri women. Materials and methods The study participants consisted of 100 women with RPL of Iranian Azeri origin. The control group comprised 100 age- and ethnically-matched healthy women of the same reproductive age. Genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood and genotype determinations were performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Results Our results showed no significant relationship between IL-1RN polymorphism and RPL. The homozygous state in -857 C/T variant was seen to be higher in RPL patients than in control subjects. Also frequency of wild type genotype was lower in RPL patients than in controls. However, this associations was not significant. Conclusion This study suggested that -511 C/T (rs16944) and -31 C/T (rs1143627) polymorphisms in IL-1\u03b2 gene may not be involved in RPL in Iranian Azeri women. Also the promoter polymorphism of the IL-1RN gene may not play a role in the susceptibility to RPL.",

HCM manifests extreme variability in the degree and distribution of LVH, even in patients with the same causal mutation. Genes coding for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system components have been studied as hypertrophy modifiers in HCM, with emphasis on the angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R). However, Ang II binding to Ang II type 2 receptors (AT(2)R) also has hypertrophy-modulating effects.\n<b>Methods</b>: We investigated the effect of the functional +1675 G/A polymorphism (rs1403543) and additional single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated region of the AT(2)R gene (AGTR2) on a heritable composite hypertrophy score in an HCM family cohort in which HCM founder mutations segregate.\n<b>Results</b>: We find significant association between rs1403543 and hypertrophy, with each A allele decreasing the average wall thickness by ~0.5 mm, independent of the effects of the primary HCM causal mutation, blood pressure and other hypertrophy covariates (p = 0.020).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: This study therefore confirms a hypertrophy-modulating effect for AT(2)R also in HCM and implies that +1675 G/A could potentially be used in a panel of markers that profile a genetic predisposition to LVH in HCM.",

We examined whether MMP-9 genetic polymorphisms are associated with hypertension and with left ventricular (LV) remodeling in hypertensive patients.\n<b>Methods</b>: We studied 173 hypertensive patients and 137 age, race and gender matched healthy controls. Heart echocardiography was performed in all patients and the following MMP-9 genetic polymorphisms were analyzed: C(-1562)T (rs3918242), -90 (CA)(14-24) (rs2234681) and Q279R (rs17576).

Its genetically determined deficiency in Caucasians is associated with a frame-shift mutation +1637delC (rs28357092) of the FCN3 gene. When it was described for the first time, it was postulated to be strictly associated with enhanced susceptibility to infections. At present, with our knowledge extended by several other patients that issue seems to be more complicated and less clear-cut. Two new cases of primary Ficolin-3 deficiency are reported here: a 50-year old male, suffering from membranous nephropathy and an 11-month old male infant who was operated on to repair congenital heart disease. Based on those cases and a literature review, we conclude that the clinical consequences of congenital Ficolin-3 deficiency are still unclear and such questions as whether it may be life-threatening or acts as a disease modifier remain to be elucidated.",

                "text": "Asthma is a chronic disease that is particularly common in children. The association between polymorphisms of the gene encoding intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and gene-environment interactions with childhood asthma has not been fully investigated. A cross-sectional study was undertaken to investigate these associations among children in Taiwan. The effects of two functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ICAM1, rs5491 (K56M) and rs5498 (K469E), and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) were studied. Two hundred and eighteen asthmatic and 877 nonasthmatic children were recruited from elementary schools. It was found that the genetic effect of each SNP was modified by the other SNP and by exposure to ETS. The risk of asthma was higher for children carrying the rs5491 AT or TT genotypes and the rs5498 GG genotype (odds ratio = 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.09\u20132.59) than for those with the rs5491 AA and rs5498 AA or AG genotypes (the reference group). The risk for the other two combinations of genotypes did not differ significantly from that of the reference group (p of interaction = 0.0063). The two studied ICAM1 SNPs were associated with childhood asthma among children exposed to ETS, but not among those without ETS exposure (p of interaction = 0.05 and 0.01 for rs5491 and rs5498, respectively). Both ICAM1 and ETS, and interactions between these two factors are likely to be involved in the development of asthma in childhood.",

This study was designed to evaluate the pattern, alliance and risk of renin Mbo I (10631A>G; rs2368564) polymorphism at the locus intron 9 for a possible role in modulating essential hypertension in adult population from Gujarat (India). A total of 257 consecutively enrolled essential hypertensive patients and 270 controls were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method for the selected marker. Suitable descriptive statistics was used for different variables. Genotypic (x(2) 10.43, p 0.0054) and allelic (x(2) 11.46, p 0.0007) distribution of this SNP displayed significant differences between cases and controls with an increased frequency of the A allele (x(2) 6.275; p 0.0122) and A/A geno-type (x(2) 8.247; p 0.0041) in hypertensive individuals. However, it showed no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in either affected or control group. A significant association was found in the A/A variant of rs2368564 with essential hypertension (p 0.0032), along with a statistically significant increase in odds of hypertension (OR 1.69; CI 1.46-2.28; p 0.02), even after confounding factors were adjusted in multiple logistic regression analysis and is substantiated by inter-genotypic variations in the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients. In conclusion, renin 10631A>G gene mutation at the ninth intron play critical roles in BP (dys)regulation and can be implicated in an individual's susceptibility for hypertension.",

However, an overall association of HER-2 polymorphism (Ile655Val) with available cancer studies has not yet been explored. In the present study, a probable correlation of HER-2 Ile655Val polymorphism with 6 major types of cancers including breast, lung, gastric, ovarian, thyroid and uterine has been collectively assessed.\n<b>Methodology</b>: Extensive data mining was performed using online available medical research databanks including Pubmed, Ovid, Medline and Embase. Research articles were retrieved based on common keywords \"HER-2, polymorphism, (SNP) and cancer (including breast, gastric, lung, ovarian, thyroid and uterine). A database was maintained and updated for case control studies of HER-2 genotype Ile655Val (rs1136201) information until February 2015. Based on selection criteria, a total of 41 studies containing 37,111 subjects (17845 patients, 19266 controls) were selected for thorough insight about HER-2.\n<b>Results</b>: A significant risk association of HER-2 Ile655Val polymorphism was observed in different types of cancer using various genetic models (co-dominant heterogeneous Ile/Val vs Ile/Ile; OR=1.1, 95% CI = 1.01-1.16, P = 0.01 and dominant; OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.03-1.20, P = 0.0003).

                "text": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototype autoimmune disease with complex etiology. Loss of immune tolerance and synthesis of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens contributes to the disease. Genetic aberrations disrupting the functions of immune regulatory receptors may facilitate the development of autoimmune diseases. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) is an inhibitory receptor for T cells and this study was carried out to analyze the influence of CTLA4 +49A/G (rs231775) polymorphism on susceptibility to SLE in ethnic Tamils. Three hundred SLE patients and 460 age and sex similar, ethnicity-matched controls were screened for the +49 A/G polymorphism by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The wild allele (A) frequency in controls and cases was 63% and 47%, respectively. The presence of heterozygous (AG) and homozygous mutant (GG) genotype was associated with a significant risk to develop SLE (P = 0.0001, OR-2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6-3.3) and (P = 0.0001, OR-4.3, 95% CI, 2.8-6.99). The frequency of mutant allele (G) in patients was also significantly associated with SLE (P = 0.0001, OR-1.9, 95% CI, 1.5-2.4). However, this polymorphism did not influence the clinical or serological phenotypes in our study. Therefore the CTLA4 +49 A/G polymorphism is a potential genetic risk factor for lupus susceptibility in South Indian Tamils, but does not appear to influence either the clinical or serological phenotype.",

However, no neuroimaging studies assessed the effects of this allele on brain morphology in alcohol use disorders and its demonstrated change during abstinence from alcohol. Here we assessed the effects of the BDNF Val66Met (rs6265) polymorphism on regional brain tissue volumes and their recovery during short-term abstinence in treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent individuals. 3D T1 weighted magnetic resonance images from 62 individuals were acquired at 1.5 T at one week of abstinence from alcohol; 41 of the participants were rescanned at 5 weeks of abstinence. The images were segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid and parcellated into regional volumes. The BDNF genotype was determined from blood samples using the TaqMan technique. Alcohol-dependent Val (Valine)/Met heterozygotes and Val homozygotes had similar regional brain volumes at either time point. However, Val homozygotes had significant GM volume increases, while Val/Met heterozygotes increased predominantly in WM volumes over the scan interval. Longitudinal increases in GM but not WM volumes were related to improvements in neurocognitive measures during abstinence. The findings suggest that functionally significant brain tissue volume recovery during abstinence from alcohol is influenced by BDNF genotype.",

Only a limited number of studies on the association between IL18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk of periodontitis have been realized, however. The aim of this case-control study among young post-partum Japanese women (18 to 45 years) was to determine the impact of SNPs, rs1946518 (-607 C/A) and rs187238 (-137G/C), on periodontitis. The two SNPs may be located within a transcription factor-binding element, thereby influencing transcription from the IL18 promoter. Subjects were 131 cases who had at least one tooth with a probing pocket depth of \u2265 4.0 mm and 1,017 periodontally healthy controls. Probing pocket depth measurements were performed between 1 and 12 months post-partum. In this population, the A allele of rs1946518 and the C allele of rs187238 are more common. After adjustment for age, education, smoking, and use of an interdental brush, compared with subjects with the AA or AC genotype of SNP rs1946518, those with the CC genotype had a significantly reduced risk of periodontitis (adjusted odds ratio = 0.54, 95% confidence interval = 0.29-0.97). No significant association was observed between rs187238 and the risk of periodontitis. Our study did not reveal any evidence of interaction between the IL18 polymorphisms and smoking. Our findings indicate that the IL18 promoter SNP, rs1946518, is a potential risk factor of periodontitis among young Japanese women.",

A functional Leu33Pro polymorphism (rs5918) in the beta(3) subunit of the integrin gene (ITGB3) has previously been suggested to act as a modifier of ovarian cancer risk in Polish BRCA1 mutation carriers. To investigate the association further, we genotyped 9,998 BRCA1 and 5,544 BRCA2 mutation carriers from 34 studies from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 for the ITGB3 Leu33Pro polymorphism. Data were analysed within a Cox-proportional hazards framework using a retrospective likelihood approach. There was marginal evidence that the ITGB3 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer for BRCA1 mutation carriers (per-allele Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.23, p-trend 0.05). However, when the original Polish study was excluded from the analysis, the polymorphism was no longer significantly associated with ovarian cancer risk (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96-1.19, p-trend 0.25). There was no evidence of an association with ovarian cancer risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.89-1.32). The polymorphism was not associated with breast cancer risk for either BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. The ITGB3 Leu33Pro polymorphism does not modify breast or ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers.",

Therefore, we focused on carriers and non-carriers of the PPARG Pro12Ala (rs1801282) variant, as it is a relatively common variant with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.14. It has also been shown to affect ligand binding and transcription, and carriage of the minor allele (Ala12) is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. We re-invited 39 Pro12Pro, 34 Pro12Ala, and 30 Ala12Ala carriers and performed detailed anthropometric and serological assessments.\n<b>Results</b>: The participation rates in the GBR study were 31%, 44%, and 40%, and accordingly we included 12, 15, and 13 individuals with Pro12Pro, Pro12Ala, and Ala12Ala variants, respectively. There were no differences in anthropometric or metabolic variables among the different genotype groups.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our report highlights that from a practical perspective, GBR can be used to study genotype-phenotype relationships. This approach can prove to be a valuable tool for follow-up findings from large-scale genetic discovery studies by undertaking detailed phenotyping procedures that might not be feasible in large studies. However, our study also illustrates the need for a larger pool of genotyped or sequenced individuals to allow for selection of rare variants with larger effects that can be examined in a GBR study of the present size.",

We investigated the association of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene with CAD, considering the interaction between the genetic and non-genetic factors, using a larger and ethnically homogeneous angiographic cohort. A total of 1254 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac catheterization (735 with CAD and 519 without) were recruited. T174M (rs4762), M235T (rs699), G-6A, A-20C, G-152A, and G-217A polymorphisms of the AGT gene were genotyped. We used a regression approach based on a generalized linear model to evaluate haplotype effects defined by the multilocus data and detection of gene-environment interaction by incorporating interaction terms in the model. We found significant differences in global AGT gene haplotype profile between patients with and without CAD (the global score statistic=25.411, P=0.008). Significant interactions between AGT gene haplotypes, gender and hypertension were detected. We also used haplotype counting to directly estimate the odds ratio of each AGT gene haplotype, and found that the effects of haplotypes were markedly different in subgroups defined by gender and hypertension, providing strong evidence of gene-environment interaction. Female gender synergistically enhances (or male gender reverses) the effects of AGT gene haplotypes on the risk of CAD in the presence of hypertension. In conclusion, the effect of AGT gene haplotypes on the risk of CAD was significantly increased in women with hypertension, which highlights the importance of evaluating gene-environment interactions in the genetic study of CAD.",

Acquired infection is commonly associated with ocular disease. Pathology is characterized by strong proinflammatory responses. Ligation of ATP by purinergic receptor P2X(7), encoded by P2RX7, stimulates proinflammatory cytokines and can lead directly to killing of intracellular pathogens. To determine whether P2X(7) has a role in susceptibility to congenital toxoplasmosis, we examined polymorphisms at P2RX7 in 149 child/parent trios from North America. We found association (FBAT Z-scores +/-2.429; P=0.015) between the derived C(+)G(-) allele (f=0.68; OR=2.06; 95% CI: 1.14-3.75) at single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1718119 (1068T>C; Thr-348-Ala), and a second synonymous variant rs1621388 in linkage disequilibrium with it, and clinical signs of disease per se. Analysis of clinical subgroups showed no association with hydrocephalus, with effect sizes for associations with retinal disease and brain calcifications enhanced (OR=3.0-4.25; 0.004<P<0.009) when hydrocephalus was removed from the analysis. Association with toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis was replicated (FBAT Z-scores +/-3.089; P=0.002) in a small family-based study (60 families; 68 affected offspring) of acquired infection in Brazil, where the ancestral T(+) allele (f=0.296) at SNP rs1718119 was strongly protective (OR=0.27; 95% CI: 0.09-0.80).",

                "text": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a multifactorial type of cancer, and cytokines driving the immune response seem to be disturbed in patients with NPC. Interleukin-10 (IL10) is an immunosuppressive cytokine which may facilitate carcinogenesis by down-regulating interferon-gamma production and supporting tumor escape from the immune response. We propose that differential expression levels of IL10 among individuals due to polymorphisms within the promoter of IL-10 gene, may be associated with NPC susceptibility. Therefore, the current study aimed at investigating the association of IL10 promoter genotypes with NPC and examining the interaction among the IL10 genotype and individual smoking habit in NPC susceptibility in Taiwan. A total of 698 native Taiwanese consisting of 176 cases and 522 controls were enrolled in this hospital-based study, and three single-nucleotide polymorphism sites at promoter regions of IL10, A-1082G (rs1800896), T-819C (rs3021097), and A-592C (rs1800872) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and their interaction with smoking habit for NPC risk were evaluated. There were significantly different distributions of genotypic (p=0.0004) and allelic (p=0.0222) frequencies of IL10 A-1082G among NPC and controls. Individuals who carried AG or GG genotypes for IL10 A-1082G had a 1.91- and 3.26-fold higher risk of developing NPC compared to those who carried the AA genotype (95% confidence interval=1.28-2.85 and 1.35-7.85), respectively. None of the other polymorphisms investigated appeared to affect NPC risk. In gene-lifestyle interaction analysis, we have provided the first evidence ever to show that there is an obvious joint effect of IL10 A-1082G genotype with individual smoking habit on NPC risk. The results support the concept that interleukins may play a role in NPC development and that IL10 A-1082G, which is closely related to its protein expression, maybe a useful biomarker for NPC progression.",

Therefore, this study explored the clinical relevance of genetic polymorphisms in some components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).\n<b>Material And Methods</b>: Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood from 95 metastatic breast or colorectal cancer patients treated with bevacizumab, and AGTR1-A1166C (rs5186), AGT-M235T (rs699) SNPs and ACE I/D (rs4646994) polymorphisms were genotyped using RT-PCR. Circulating vascular endothelial grow factor and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels were analysed using ELISA kits. The antitumoral activity of bevacizumab was assayed in mice orthotopically xenografted with AGTR1-overexpressing breast cancer cells.\n<b>Results</b>: The ACE IN/IN genotype was associated with a higher rate of disease progression compared to DEL/IN and DEL/DEL genotypes (36% vs. 11\u00b71% P < 0\u00b705). Similarly, AGTR1-1166A/A genotype was also associated with a higher rate of disease progression compared to AGTR1-1166A/C and AGTR1-1166C/C genotypes (24\u00b74% vs. 2\u00b77% P < 0\u00b701). ACE IN/IN genotype was also found to be associated with shorter time to treatment failure compared to ACE IN/DEL and ACE DEL/DEL genotypes (14 weeks vs. 41\u00b771, P = 0\u00b7033), whereas circulating ACE levels were found to be associated with a better response to bevacizumab treatment. Besides, in vivo experiments showed a significantly higher antitumoral activity of bevacizumab in tumours derived from AGTR1-overexpressing breast cancer cells.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: A higher activity of ACE-angiotensin-II-AGTR1 axis is associated with a better response to bevacizumab, supporting that the RAS can be an important source of potential predictive markers of response to anti-angiogenic drugs.",

                "text": "Previous candidate gene and genome-wide association studies have identified common genetic variants in LPA associated with the quantitative trait Lp(a), an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease. These associations are population-specific and many have not yet been tested for association with the clinical outcome of interest. To fill this gap in knowledge, we accessed the epidemiologic Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES III) and BioVU, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center biorepository linked to de-identified electronic health records (EHRs), including billing codes (ICD-9-CM) and clinical notes, to test population-specific Lp(a)-associated variants for an association with myocardial infarction (MI) among African Americans. We performed electronic phenotyping among African Americans in BioVU\u226540 years of age using billing codes. At total of 93 cases and 522 controls were identified in NHANES III and 265 cases and 363 controls were identified in BioVU. We tested five known Lp(a)-associated genetic variants (rs1367211, rs41271028, rs6907156, rs10945682, and rs1652507) in both NHANES III and BioVU for association with myocardial infarction. We also tested LPA rs3798220 (I4399M), previously associated with increased levels of Lp(a), MI, and coronary artery disease in European Americans, in BioVU. After meta-analysis, tests of association using logistic regression assuming an additive genetic model revealed no significant associations (p<0.05) for any of the five LPA variants previously associated with Lp(a) levels in African Americans. Also, I4399M rs3798220 was not associated with MI in African Americans (odds ratio = 0.51; 95% confidence interval: 0.16 - 1.65; p=0.26) despite strong, replicated associations with MI and coronary artery disease in European American genome-wide association studies. These data highlight the challenges in translating quantitative trait associations to clinical outcomes in diverse populations using large epidemiologic and clinic-based collections as envisioned for the Precision Medicine Initiative.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2141698, -1687A/G; rs11895564, Ala380Thr) of the integrin alpha 6 (ITGA6) gene are associated with the development and clinicopathologic characteristics of PTC such as the size (<1 cm and \u22651 cm), number (unifocality and multifocality), location (one lobe and both lobes), extrathyroid invasion, and cervical lymph node metastasis.\n<b>Methods</b>: We enrolled 104 PTC patients and 318 control subjects. Genotypes of each SNP were determined by direct sequencing. SNPStats, SNPAnalyzer, and Helixtree programs were used to evaluate odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and P-values. Multiple logistic regression models were performed to analyze genetic data.\n<b>Results</b>: A missense SNP rs11895564 was associated with the development of PTC. The A allele frequency of rs11895564 was higher in PTC patients than in controls (13.5% vs. 7.1%; P = 0.005; OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.37). In the clinicopathologic characteristics, the A allele frequency of rs11895564 showed difference in the size (19.6% in <1 cm vs. 6.9% in \u22651 cm; P = 0.010; OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.75) and number (8.5% in unifocality vs. 20.8% in multifocality; P = 0.015; OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.23 to 6.59) of PTC.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: These results suggest that the A allele of rs11895564 (Ala380Thr) in ITGA6 may be a risk factor of PTC, and also contribute to the progression of PTC in the Korean population.",

                "text": "Haplo-insufficiency of the bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcription factor single-minded 1 (SIM1) causes severe obesity in mice and humans. We hypothesized that common genetic variations in/near SIM1 could exert more subtle effects on its function and associate with human adiposity. First, SIM1 coding regions were sequenced in severely obese subjects, and two common nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) were identified: Pro352Thr (rs3734354) and Ala371Val (rs3734355). We next carried out a SNP association study of five adiposity traits (BMI, % body fat, abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat, and leptin concentrations) in 1,699 whites and 1,173 blacks. TagSNPs covering SIM1 and nearby conserved regions, and the only common nsSNP in SIM1's binding partner aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2) (Gly679Ser/rs4072568), were investigated. The effects of rs3734355/4 on SIM1 activity were tested using an in vitro reporter assay. We replicated previous observations that homozygosity for the 371Val allele was associated with higher BMI in white males (P = 0.003). Together with previous findings in white males (combined n = 3,479), BMI was increased by 1.10 kg/m(2) in 371Val homozygotes (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-1.95 kg/m(2), P = 0.01). In vitro, the 352Thr-371Val haplotype impaired SIM1 transcriptional activity by 22% (P < 0.0001). TagSNP analysis of SIM1 revealed two SNPs in the 3' region (rs9390322 and rs7746743) and another in intron 5 (rs3734353) to be significantly associated with various adiposity measures in ethnicity- and sex-specific manners after multiple testing correction. In white males, rs4072568 in ARNT2 was also associated with BMI (P = 9 \u00d7 10(-4)) and % body fat (P = 0.001). Our findings implicate heritable defects of the SIM1-ARNT2 axis in the predisposition to human obesity.",

There is evidence that development of AC associated with Thr83Ala polymorphism of matrix GLA-protein gene. The objective of this study was to examine the association between Thr83Ala polymorphism of matrix Cla protein (MGP) gene and AC in male and female subjects of the Ukrainian population. 40 AC and 40 healthy controls were recruited to the study. MGP exon 4 Thr83Ala polymorphism (rs 4236) was examined using the polymerase chain reaction with subsequent restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The obtained data show that the substitution of threonin by alanine at position 83 in a molecule of MGP can affect its functional characteristics and anticalcinogenic properties. The distribution of homozygous carriers of a major allelic variant, and heterozygous and homozygous minor allele variants of Thr83Ala polymorphism in patients with AC was 40,0%, 47,5%, and 12,5% respectively. The corresponding distribution of variants in the control group was 32,5%, 42,5% and 25,0% (p=0,352 by \u03c72 -test). In women who are carriers of Ala/Ala-variant, CA occurs more rarely than in men with the same genotype (p=0,036 by \u03c72 -test). The substitution of threonine by alanine due to MGP exon 4 Thr83Ala polymorphism is related to a decrease in the likelihood of CA in female persons in the Ukrainian population.",

Previous investigations showed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as well as the interaction with neuropeptide S receptor 1 (NPSR1) are linked to the development of psychological distress. This study examined the association of polymorphisms of genes encoding these proteins with depression and anxiety in a representative group of Jordanian HD patients.\n<b>Methods</b>: A total of 302 HD patients were involved in the study and categorized into three groups based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS-D or HADS-A scores as follows: normal (<7), mild (8-10) and moderate-severe (11-21). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of NPSR1 Asn107Ile (rs324981), IL-6 G174C (rs1800795), and BDNF Val66Met (rs6265) was genotyped using blood samples.\n<b>Results</b>: The frequency of Ile-allele of NPSR1 Asn107Ile was significantly higher in patients with moderate-severe HADS-A scores versus normal (53% vs. 40.8%, p = .035). Using ordinal regression analysis, Asn-allele of NPSR1 polymorphism was nominally significantly associated with a lower risk of anxiety (OR = 0.57, CI: 0.33-0.97, p = .038) after adjusting for other covariates. A marginally significant difference in genotype distribution of IL-6 G174C was observed among patients according to HADS-D scores (p = .05). Furthermore, carriers of IL-6174 CC genotype showed lower median IL-6 serum concentration versus carriers of GG genotype (5.2 vs. 1.35 pg/mL, p < .05).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The results support the genetic role of NPSR1 in the pathogenesis of anxiety and suggest that carriers of NPSR1 Ile-allele are at increased risk of anxiety in HD patients. Neither BDNF Val66Met nor IL-6 G174C were linked to psychological symptoms. Future studies among other ethnicities are necessary to verify the observations.",

This study aimed to investigate the genetic association of COL1A1 -1997 G/T (rs1107946) and COL1A1 Sp1 +1245 G/T (rs1800012) polymorphisms with the incidence of scars.\n<b>Materials And Methods</b>: A case-control association study was conducted with 84 volunteers from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (47 patients and 37 controls). The allele frequency distribution and nucleotide genotypes of -1997 G/T, +1245 G/T were ascertained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.\n<b>Results</b>: Our results indicated that the distribution of COL1A1 (rs1107946) genotypes was significantly different between patients and controls (P = 0.00). The incidence of COL1A1 (rs1107946) genotype GG was significantly associated with a risk of scars. The distribution of the (rs1107946) genotype was drastically higher in women with scars (P= 0.00). One haplotype block in COL1A1 was documented by the pair-wise linkage disequilibrium between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The frequency of the GG haplotype constructed by the two SNPs was robustly high and associated with risk of scars.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Our results strengthen the evidence for the association between polymorphisms of -1997 G/T, +1245 G/T of the COL1A1 gene in the genetic etiology of keloid scars.",

The results were compared with those of 92 healthy controls without FA, personal and/or family history of atopy.\n<b>Results</b>: Analysis and comparison of genotype distributions, allele frequencies, and haplotypes showed that none of the genotypes confers an increased risk of FA. The genotype -1082 AA in FA patients was associated with moderate to severe symptoms of FA, the development of atopic asthma, and higher levels of IL-10. In a linear regression study, we confirmed that the genotype -1082 AA acts as an independent factor for the higher levels of IL-10. A positive association was also observed between -819T/C and -592 A/C SNPs and later onset of FA.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Polymorphisms in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene are not associated with FA susceptibility in our cohort. In FA patients, -1082 A/G SNPs seem to influence the production of IL-10, the severity of FA symptoms, and the development of atopic asthma in this population.",

Accumulated evidences demonstrated that oncoprotein MDM4 plays a crucial role in the TP53 tumor suppressor signaling pathway. An rs4245739 A>C polymorphism locating in the MDM4 3'-untranslated region creates a miR-191 target site and results in allele-specific MDM4 expression. In this study, we examined the association between this polymorphism as well as the TP53 Arg72Pro (rs1042522 G>C) genetic variant and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) risk in a Chinese Han population. Genotypes were determined in 200 NHL cases and 400 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression. We found significantly increased NHL risk among carriers of the TP53 72Pro allele compared with those with the 72Arg allele (P = 0.002 for the Pro/Pro genotype). We also observed a significantly decreased NHL risks among carriers of the MDM4 rs4245739 C allele compared with those with the A allele in Chinese (P = 0.014 for the AC genotype). Stratified analyses revealed the associations between these SNPs and NHL risk are especially noteworthy in young or male individuals. Additionally, the associations are much pronounced in NHL patients with B-cell lymphomas or grade 3 or 4 disease. Our results indicate that the TP53 Arg72Pro and the MDM4 rs4245739 polymorphisms contribute to NHL susceptibility and support the hypothesis that genetic variants in the TP53 pathway genes can act as important modifiers of NHL risk.",

However, 6-MP also has dose-limiting toxicities, particularly life-threatening myelosuppression, due to genetic polymorphisms in enzymes that metabolize 6-MP. Promising biomarkers for predicting 6-MP-induced leukopenia is still unclear in Chinese population. Here, we evaluated the associations of NUDT15, TPMT and ITPA genotypes with 6-MP intolerance in our cohort of childhood ALL patients.\n<b>Methods</b>: A total of 105 Chinese pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ALL were enrolled. We identified the NUDT15 coding variant rs116855232 (c.415C > T), a newly discovered 6-MP toxicity-related locus in Asians, and polymorphisms in TPMT rs1142345 and ITPA rs11273540. Associations between genotypes and 6-MP dose sensitivity, leukopenia, hepatotoxicity, and therapy interruption were evaluated.\n<b>Results</b>: The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of NUDT15 rs116855232, TPMT rs1142345 and ITPA rs11273540 were 15.7, 2.9, and 18.1%, respectively. NUDT15 and TPMT genetic variants were strongly associated with 6-MP dose intensity. Patients with NUDT15 homogenous genotype (TT) were highly sensitive to 6-MP (dose intensity of 60.27%) compared to these with heterozygous genotype (TC) or wild type (CC), who tolerated an average dose intensity of 83.83 and 94.24%, respectively. The NUDT15 variant was a predictor for leukopenia (OR: 3.62, 95% CI 1.377-9.501, P = 0.009) and early-onset leukopenia (OR: 9.63, 95% CI 2.764-33.514, P = 3.75 \u00d7 10<sup>- 4</sup>). No differences were found between 6-MP dose intensity and ITPA polymorphisms.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: NUDT15 variant is an optimal predictor for 6-MP intolerance in Chinese pediatric ALL patients and may have greatly clinical implications for individualized therapy.",

A polymorphism *1244 A>G (rs7744) in the 3''untranslated region of MyD88 has been identified. In the present study, the association of this polymorphism with ulcerative colitis (UC) was investigated. The population studied comprised 922 individuals, including patients with UC (UC cases) and without (controls). Genotyping of rs7744 was performed by PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism and the rs7744 G allele frequencies in the controls and UC cases were 32.8 and 43.5%, respectively (P<0.0001). The results showed that the genotype frequency of the AA homozygote was significantly lower and that of the GG homozygote was significantly higher in the UC cases compared with those in the controls (P=0.0012 for both groups). The rs7744 minor allele variants were significantly associated with susceptibility to UC as indicated by dominant and recessive genetic models. The minor allele variants were associated with an increased risk for UC in the male individuals but not the female individuals. The rs7744 was also associated with a non'continuous phenotype of UC and steroid unused/independent UC. This minor allele homozygote was associated with the disease severity of UC, hospitalization and response to steroid treatment. The results of the present study provided evidence that MyD88 polymorphism rs7744 was significantly associated with the development of UC and that this polymorphism may be associated with the response to treatment therapies for UC.",

We have explored aspects of retrospective and prospective memory including semantic, short term, working and long-term memory in conjunction with brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1). The memory scores for healthy individuals in the population were obtained for each memory type and the population was genotyped via restriction fragment length polymorphism for the BDNF rs6265 (Val66Met) SNP and via pyrosequencing for the TNF-\u03b1 rs113325588 SNP. Using univariate ANOVA, a significant association of the BDNF polymorphism with visual and spatial memory retention and a significant association of the TNF-\u03b1 polymorphism was observed with spatial memory retention. In addition, a significant interactive effect between BDNF and TNF-\u03b1 polymorphisms was observed in spatial memory retention. In practice visual memory involves spatial information and the two memory systems work together, however our data demonstrate that individuals with the Val/Val BDNF genotype have poorer visual memory but higher spatial memory retention, indicating a level of interaction between TNF-\u03b1 and BDNF in spatial memory retention. This is the first study to use genetic analysis to determine the interaction between BDNF and TNF-\u03b1 in relation to memory in normal adults and provides important information regarding the effect of genetic determinants and gene interactions on human memory.",

Methionine synthase (MTR) plays a central role in folate metabolism, thereby affecting DNA methylation. The association between A2756G polymorphism (rs1805087) in MTR and digestive system cancer susceptibility was inconsistent in previous studies. To investigate this inconsistency, we performed this meta-analysis.\n<b>Methods</b>: Databases including Pubmed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched to find relevant studies. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association. Potential sources of heterogeneity were also assessed by subgroup analysis and meta-regression.\n<b>Results</b>: A total of 29 articles with 15,368 patients and 23,959 controls were included. We found no association between MTR A2756G polymorphism and digestive system cancer in overall population (G allele: OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.98-1.09, P = 0.25; dominant model: OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.97-1.10, P = 0.33; recessive model: OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.89-1.17, P = 0.79). In the stratified analyses according to cancer type, sample size and genotyping method, no evidence of any gene-disease association was obtained in almost all genetic models. However, marginal significant associations were found for East Asians and hospital-based studies.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: This meta-analysis suggests that there is no significant association between the MTR A2756G polymorphism and digestive system cancer risk.",

In this Human Genome Epidemiology review, the authors assessed this relation in an updated meta-analysis of 60 association studies. Electronic literature searches were conducted on September 14, 2009. Population-based cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, or genome-wide association studies reporting associations between the PPARG Pro12Ala gene variant (rs1801282) and type 2 diabetes were included. An updated literature-based meta-analysis involving 32,849 type 2 diabetes cases and 47,456 controls in relation to the PPARG Pro12Ala variant was conducted. The combined overall odds ratio, calculated by per-allele genetic model random-effects meta-analysis for type 2 diabetes and the Pro12Ala polymorphism, was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.81, 0.90). The analysis indicated a moderate level of heterogeneity attributable to genuine variation in gene effect size (I(2) = 37%). This may reflect the variation observed between ethnic populations and/or differences in body mass index. Work on PPARG Pro12Ala should now focus on the observed heterogeneity in the magnitude of the association between populations. Further investigations into gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may prove enlightening.",

                "text": "Mendelian randomization studies on fibrinogen commonly use a single genetic variant as an instrument, but this may explain only a small proportion of the total phenotypic variance. We examined the contribution of multiple common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the entire fibrinogen gene cluster to plasma fibrinogen levels in two prospective cohorts, for use as instruments in future Mendelian randomization studies. Genotypes for 20 SNPs were determined in 2,778 middle-age (49-64 years) men from the Second-Northwick-Park-Heart Study (NPHS-II). These were replicated in 3,705 men from the Whitehall-II study (WH-II). Plasma fibrinogen levels were determined six times in NPHS-II and three times in WH-II. The minor alleles of four SNPs from the FGB gene, two from the FGA gene, and one from the FGG gene were associated with higher plasma fibrinogen levels. SNP rs1800790 (-455G>A) commonly used in Mendelian randomization studies was associated with R2=1.22% of the covariate adjusted residual variance in fibrinogen level. A variable selection procedure identified one additional SNP: rs2070011 (FGA) altogether explaining R2=1.45% of the residual variance in fibrinogen level. Using these SNPs no evidence for causality between the fibrinogen levels and coronary heart diseases was found in instrumental variables analysis. In the replication cohort, WH-II, the effects of the two SNPs on fibrinogen levels were consistent with the NPHS-II results. There is statistical evidence for several functional sites in the fibrinogen gene cluster that determine an individual's plasma fibrinogen levels. Thus, a combination of several SNPs will provide a stronger instrument for fibrinogen Mendelian randomization studies.",

Compared with the general population, the elite MLD swimmers, especially the females, had a higher frequency of the <i>RR</i> genotype. The swimmers had a higher frequency of the <i>R</i> allele than the general population. However, the difference was not statistically significant. After being stratified by performance, the difference of the <i>R</i> allele frequency between the international master athletes and the general population was statistically significant. The elite MLD swimmers had a higher frequency of the <i>RR</i> genotype than the <i>RX+XX</i> genotype compared with the general population.

In addition, several studies have suggested a role for the MCP-1 and CCR2 genotypes in cognitive impairment and depression, which are common non-motor symptoms in PD patients. In this study, a cohort of 521 PD patients and 556 cases of healthy controls were recruited to investigate the association between the MCP-1 2518A/G (rs1064211) and CCR2 V64I (rs1799864) gene polymorphisms and PD risk in the Chinese population. We also analyze the influence of these genotypes on the cognitive function and depression in PD patients by comparing Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Chinese Revision (WAIS-RC), Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese Revision (WMS-RC) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) ratings in 217 PD patients. Our results showed no significant differences in the genotype frequency between the PD group and the control group (P > 0.05). In addition, we also failed to find an influence of the MCP-1 and CCR2 genotypes on MMSE scores, MoCA scores, WAIS-RC scores, WMS-RC scores and HAMD scores in PD patients (P > 0.05). The MCP-1 and CCR2 gene polymorphisms may not be genetic risk factors for PD in the Han Chinese population, and they do not appear to influence cognitive function and depression in PD patients.",

In this study, we investigated genetic association between TNF gene and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in a Korean population.\n<b>Methods</b>: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TNF gene [-857C/T (rs1799724) and -308G/A (rs1800629)] were selected and genotyped using direct sequencing in 144 ICH patients and 455 control subjects. Genotype distribution and allele frequency were compared between cases and controls using logistic regression.\n<b>Results</b>: -857C/T was significantly associated with ICH in log-additive [odds ratio (OR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-2.24, p = 0.0081], and recessive models (OR = 3.25, 95% CI = 1.28-8.27, p = 0.016). The frequency of the -857TT genotype increased in ICH patients. Allele frequency analysis also showed that the -857T allele was associated with an increased risk of ICH (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.15-2.30, p = 0.006). In the analysis according to the gender, we found that the association of -857C/T was gender-different. The -857C/T was significantly associated with ICH only in males (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.24-3.19, p = 0.0043 in males; OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.76-2.22, p = 0.34 in females).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: These results suggest that promoter polymorphism of TNF gene, -857C/T, may be involved in the susceptibility of ICH in males.",

Genotype at rs28357094 was determined after completion of the clinical evaluations. Patients were stratified in 2 groups according to a dominant model (TT homozygotes vs TG heterozygotes and GG homozygotes) and clinical data were retrospectively compared between groups.\n<b>Results</b>: Eighty patients were selected (age 4.1-19.3 years; mean 8.3 \u00b1 2.7 SD). There were no differences in age or steroid treatment between the 2 subgroups. Paired t test showed a significant difference in both NSAA (p = 0.013) and 6MWT (p = 0.03) between baseline and follow-up after 12 months in patients with DMD carrying the G allele. The difference was not significant in the T subgroup. The analysis of covariance using age and baseline values as covariate and SPP1 genotype as fixed effect showed that these parameters are significantly correlated with the 12-month values.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: These data provide evidence of the role of SPP1 genotype as a disease modifier in DMD and support its relevance in the selection of homogeneous groups of patients for future clinical trials.",

We evaluated the association of hRAD17 Leu546Arg (rs1045051), a missense single nucleotide polymorphism, with the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in relation to smoking and alcohol consumption history in 154 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma male patients and 695 cancer-free male controls by a case-control study conducted in Japan. The results showed that the hRAD17 Arg/Arg genotype compared to the Leu/Leu and Leu/Arg genotypes was significantly associated with the risk of the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with an adjusted odds ratios of 2.22 (95% CI: 1.19-4.16 P=0.013). In stratified studies, the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was markedly higher in light drinkers (less than 23 g ethanol/day) with the Arg/Arg genotype than in heavy drinkers (excess of 23 g ethanol/day) with the Arg/Arg genotype (OR=2.83, 95% CI: 1.05-7.61, P=0.04). We concluded that the genetic variant of hRAD17 Leu546Arg polymorphism exerts a significant effect on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma risk among Japanese men.",

                "text": "<b>Background</b>: The effect of \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) polymorphisms on the treatment response to longacting bronchodilators in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unclear. We aimed to establish whether ADRB2 polymorphisms differentially affected COPD exacerbation outcomes in response to tiotropium versus salmeterol.\n<b>Methods</b>: We did a prespecified analysis of the ADRB2 polymorphisms Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu within the 1 year randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group Prevention Of Exacerbations with Tiotropium in COPD (POET-COPD) trial, comparing the effects of treatment with tiotropium or salmeterol on exacerbations in 7376 patients with COPD. One blood sample was collected for pharmacogenetic testing from each patient who elected to participate in the substudy. Random assignment of patients to treatment groups was not stratified according to genotypes. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole-blood specimens and samples were genotyped for the two SNPs, rs1042713 (Arg16Gly) and rs1042714 (Gln27Glu). All assays were done in technical duplicates and 10% of samples that were randomly chosen were repeated as technical duplicates in a second independent genotyping process. Our primary endpoint was the risk of a first exacerbation of COPD based on time to first exacerbation data. An exacerbation of COPD was defined as the increase or new onset of more than one symptom of COPD (cough, sputum, wheezing, dyspnoea, or chest tightness), with at least one of the symptoms lasting for 3 days or more and needing treatment with antibiotics or systemic glucocorticoids (moderate exacerbations), or admission to hospital (severe exacerbations). POET-COPD is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00563381.\n<b>Findings</b>: 5125 patients gave informed consent for genotyping. The distributions of ADRB2 genotypes were well matched among groups. Polymorphisms at aminoacid 27 did not affect exacerbation outcomes. In the salmeterol group, patients with Arg16Arg genotype had a significantly reduced exacerbation risk compared with patients with Arg16Gly (p=0\u00b70130) and Gly16Gly (p=0\u00b70018) genotypes (proportion of patients with at least one exacerbation was 32\u00b73% in Arg16Arg, 39\u00b78% in Arg16Gly, and 42\u00b71% in Gly16Gly). By contrast, exacerbation risk was not modified by polymorphisms at aminoacid 16 in the tiotropium group. The effect of the Arg16Gly polymorphism on treatment response to salmeterol was dependent on the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). In patients untreated with ICS at baseline, Arg16Gly and Arg16Arg genotypes were associated with significantly prolonged time to first exacerbation compared with Gly16Gly (vs Arg16Gly p=0\u00b70164; Arg16Arg p=0\u00b70316; proportion of patients with at least one exacerbation was 28\u00b73% in Arg16Arg, 31\u00b76% in Arg16Gly, and 39\u00b72% in Gly16Gly), whereas in patients on ICS at baseline, only the Arg16Arg genotype was associated with significantly prolonged time to first exacerbation compared with Gly16Gly (p=0\u00b70198; not Arg16Gly p=0\u00b764; proportion of patients with at least one exacerbation was 35\u00b79% in Arg16Arg, 46\u00b77% in Arg16Gly, and 44\u00b78% in Gly16Gly). The respiratory disorders, in particular worsening of COPD, were the most common serious adverse events.\n<b>Interpretation</b>: Patients with the Arg16Arg genotype had better exacerbation outcomes in response to salmeterol than Gly16Gly and Arg16Gly genotypes, suggesting a potential differential Arg16Gly genotype effect on treatment response to longacting \u03b2-agonists (LABAs). However, the use of ADRB2 polymorphisms for predicting LABA treatment response is still limited and further prospective validation will be needed to advance the mechanistic understanding of \u03b2-adrenergic polymorphisms and their association with clinical features of COPD.\n<b>Funding</b>: Boehringer Ingelheim and Pfizer.",

Excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) is the lead enzyme in the nucleotide excision repair process, and low expression of ERCC1 mRNA levels has been associated with higher risk of cancers. We examined the association between two polymorphisms of ERCC1, 8092C > A (rs3212986) and 19007T > C (codon 118, rs11615), which are associated with altered ERCC1 mRNA stability and mRNA levels, in 1,752 Caucasian lung cancer patients and 1,358 controls. The results were analyzed using logistic regression models, adjusting for relevant covariates. The two polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and in linkage disequilibrium. There was no overall association between ERCC1 polymorphisms and lung cancer risk, with the adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of 1.26 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.81-1.96] for the 8092C > A polymorphism (A/A versus C/C) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.67-1.30) for the 19007T > C polymorphism (C/C versus T/T). Stratified analyses revealed that the AORs for the 8092C > A polymorphism (A/A versus C/C) decreased significantly as pack-years increased, with the AOR of 2.11 (95% CI, 1.03-4.31) in never smokers and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.25-1.01) in heavy smokers (>/=56 pack-years), respectively. Consistent results were found when gene-smoking interaction was incorporated by joint effects and interactions models that considered both discrete and continuous variables for cumulative smoking exposure. The same direction for the gene-smoking interaction was found for the 19007T > C polymorphism, although the interaction was not statistically significant. In conclusion, ERCC1 8092C > A polymorphism may modify the associations between cumulative cigarette smoking and lung cancer risk.",

Our objective was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes previously associated with auto-immunity, which are associated with toxicities in nivolumab-treated NSCLC patients. This was in order to identify patients prone to develop severe toxicities and to gain more insight into the underlying pathobiology.\n<b>Methods</b>: We analysed 322 nivolumab-treated patients and assessed the association with toxicities for seven SNPs in four genes, which are considered contributors to PD-1-directed T-cell responses, i.e., PDCD1, PTPN11, ZAP70 and IFNG. Every SNP was tested for its association with toxicity endpoints. Significant associations were tested in a validation cohort.\n<b>Results</b>: A multivariable analysis in the exploration cohort showed that homozygous variant patients for PDCD1 804C>T (rs2227981) had decreased odds for any grade treatment-related toxicities (n = 96; OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-1.0; p = 0.039). However, this result could not be validated (n = 85; OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.4-1.9; p = NS).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our results show that it is unlikely that the investigated SNPs have a clinical implication in predicting toxicity. A finding, even though negative, that is considered timely and instructive towards further research in biomarker development for checkpoint inhibitor treatments.",

Both of these \u03b1-defensins are exclusively produced in Paneth cells (PCs) at small intestinal crypt bases. Different ileal CD-associated genes including NOD2, ATG16L1, and recently the \u03b2-catenin-dependant Wnt transcription factor TCF7L2 have been linked to impaired PC antimicrobial function. The Wnt pathway influences gut mucosal homeostasis and PC maturation, besides directly controlling HD-5/6 gene expression. The herein reported candidate gene study focuses on another crucial Wnt factor, the co-receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). We analysed exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large cohort (Oxford: n = 1,893) and prospectively tested 2 additional European sample sets (Leuven: n = 688, Vienna: n = 1,628). We revealed an association of a non-synonymous SNP (rs2302685; Ile1062Val) with early onset ileal CD (OR 1.8; p = 0.00034; for homozygous carriers: OR 4.1; p = 0.00004) and additionally with penetrating ileal CD behaviour (OR 1.3; p = 0.00917). In contrast, it was not linked to adult onset ileal CD, colonic CD, or ulcerative colitis. Since the rare variant is known to impair LRP6 activity, we investigated its role in patient mucosa. Overall, LRP6 mRNA was diminished in patients independently from the genotype. Analysing the mRNA levels of PC product in biopsies from genotyped individuals (15 controls, 32 ileal, and 12 exclusively colonic CD), we found particularly low defensin levels in ileal CD patients who were carrying the variant. In addition, we confirmed a direct relationship between LRP6 activity and the transcriptional expression of HD-5 using transient transfection. Taken together, we identified LRP6 as a new candidate gene in ileal CD. Impairments in Wnt signalling and Paneth cell biology seem to represent pathophysiological hallmarks in small intestinal inflammation and should therefore be considered as interesting targets for new therapeutic approaches.",

A meta-analysis was carried out using data entered into the PubMed and Embase electronic databases before October 5, 2012. A total of 7 studies were identified for meta-analysis. The strength of the relationship between IL-1\u03b2 +3954 C>T polymorphism and the risk of EARR was assessed using odds ratio (OR). The studies provided overall OR estimates for EARR. Overall, the variant genotypes (CC and CT) of the IL-1\u03b2 +3954 C>T polymorphism were unassociated with EARR risk compared with the TT homozygote [CC vs TT, OR = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.27-6.08; CT vs TT, OR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.11-5.02]. Similarly, no associations were found in the dominant and recessive models (dominant model, OR = 1.08, 95%CI = 0.24-4.86; recessive model, OR = 1.85, 95%CI = 0.87-3.93). No publication bias was found, and no association was apparent between the IL-1\u03b2 +3954 C>T polymorphism and risk of EARR in orthodontic treatment patients. Further multicenter and better-controlled studies are required to confirm these findings.",

However, in the context of NAFLD, the transcriptional regulation of <i>PNPLA3</i> in human liver cells is not known. In this study, we aimed to define the relationship between <i>PNPLA3</i> transcription and disease characteristics of human NAFLD.\n<b>Methods</b>: The abundance of <i>PNPLA3</i> and collagen 1\u03b1 (<i>COL1\u03b1</i>) transcripts was quantified <i>in situ</i> at single-cell resolution using RNAscope\u00ae in 87 patients with NAFLD. We examined the association of <i>PNPLA3</i> and <i>COL1\u03b1</i> transcript levels with NAFLD disease severity, defined by histology.\n<b>Results</b>: While the majority of <i>PNPLA3</i> transcripts were found in hepatocytes, approximately 7% of <i>PNPLA3</i>-positive cells co-express <i>COL1\u03b1</i>, representing activated myofibroblasts. There is no association between the rs738409 genotype and the level of <i>PNPLA3</i> transcript. The overall <i>PNPLA3</i> transcript abundance is lower in zone 1 hepatocytes, patients with higher body mass index, and those with advanced liver fibrosis. The negative association between the <i>PNPLA3</i> transcript levels and liver fibrosis is largely driven by <i>COL1\u03b1</i>-positive cells.

Hence, NR1I3 genetic variants may affect bilirubin metabolism and result in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Thus far, research which investigates the association between NR1I3 variants and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia has not been undertaken in any population. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of MPJ6_1I3008 (rs10157822), IVS8+116T>G (rs4073054) and 540A>G (rs2307424) on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia development in the Malay population. Buccal swabs were collected from 232 hyperbilirubinemia and 277 control term newborns with gestational age \u226537weeks and birth weight \u22652500g. The NR1I3 variants were genotyped by using high resolution melting (HRM) assays and verified by DNA sequencing. Gender, mode of delivery and birth weight did not differ between hyperbilirubinemia and control groups. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of MPJ6_1I3008, IVS8+116T>G and 540A>G were not significantly different between the groups. However, stratification by gender revealed a significant inverse association between homozygous variant genotype of MPJ6_1I3008 and risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the females (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.95; p=0.034). This study demonstrates that the homozygous variant genotype of MPJ6_1I3008 was associated with a significant reduced risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the females.",

                "text": "Several genetic studies have shown an association between the 5-HT1A receptor gene (HTR1A) and major depressive disorder (MDD); however, results have been rather inconsistent. Moreover, to our knowledge, no association study on HTR1A and MDD in the Japanese population has been reported. Therefore, to evaluate the association between HTR1A and MDD, we conducted a case-control study of Japanese population samples with two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs6295 (C-1019G) in HTR1A. In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis of rs6295, which has been examined in other papers. Using one functional SNP (rs6295) and one tagging SNP (rs878567) selected with the HapMap database, we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (331 patients with MDD and 804 controls) in the Japanese population. Seven population-based association studies, including this study, met our criteria for the meta-analysis of rs6295. We found an association between rs878567 and Japanese MDD patients in the allele-wise analysis, but the significance of this association did not remain after Bonferroni's correction. We also did not detect any association between HTR1A and MDD in the allele/genotype-wise or haplotype-wise analysis. On the other hand, we detected an association between rs6295 and MDD in the meta-analysis (P(Z)=0.0327). In an explorative analysis, rs6295 was associated with Asian MDD patients after correction for multiple testing (P(Z)=0.0176), but not with Caucasian MDD patients (P(Z)=0.138). Our results suggest that HTR1A may not have a role in the pathophysiology of Japanese MDD patients. On the other hand, according to the meta-analysis, HTR1A was associated with MDD patients, especially in the Asian population.",

The genetic loci studied are ACE I/D (rs4340), AGT M235T (rs699), AGTR1 A1166C (rs5186), GNB3 A(-350)G (rs2071057) and APOB A/G (rs693).\n<b>Results</b>: All physiological parameters (RBC, HCT, Hb, SaO(2), HR, and BPs/d) studied significantly changed in the CMS patients while SaO(2) and HR changed in the AMS Han patients compared to their controls. The ACE D and AGT 235M alleles were found to be significantly associated with AMS and CMS, respectively, while a significantly high incidence of the G-protein (GNB3) (-350)A allele was found in the AMS patients. ACE (I/D) was significantly associated with HR in CMS patients while the AGT M235T was significantly associated with SaO(2) and BPs/d in AMS patients.

Samples of 274 Brazilian subjects from Sao Paulo were analyzed for genetic ancestry using an Affymetrix 6.0(\u00ae) genotyping platform. The CYP2C9*2 (rs1799853), CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910), and VKORC1 g.-1639G>A (rs9923231) polymorphisms were genotyped in all studied individuals.\n<b>Results</b>: The allelic frequency for the VKORC1 polymorphism was differently distributed according to self-declared ethnicity: White (50.5%), Intermediate (46.0%), Black (39.3%), Tupinikin (40.1%), and Guarani (37.3%) (p<0.001), respectively. The frequency of intermediate plus poor metabolizers (IM+PM) was higher in White (28.3%) than in Intermediate (22.7%), Black (20.5%), Tupinikin (12.9%), and Guarani (5.3%), (p<0.001). For the samples with determined ancestry, subjects carrying the GG genotype for the VKORC1 had higher African ancestry and lower European ancestry (0.14\u00b10.02 and 0.62\u00b10.02) than in subjects carrying AA (0.05\u00b10.01 and 0.73\u00b10.03) (p=0.009 and 0.03, respectively). Subjects classified as IM+PM had lower African ancestry (0.08\u00b10.01) than extensive metabolizers (0.12\u00b10.01) (p=0.02).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms are differently distributed according to self-declared ethnicity or genetic ancestry in the Brazilian general population plus Amerindians. This information is an initial step toward clinical pharmacogenetic implementation, and it could be very useful in strategic planning aiming at an individual therapeutic approach and an adverse drug effect profile prediction in an admixed population.",

Association studies with microsatellite markers using a case/control sample from the same population (n = 427) revealed significant allelic associations between the bipolar phenotype and marker NBG6. Since this marker is located in intron 9 of the P2RX7 gene, we analyzed the surrounding genomic region for the presence of polymorphisms in regulatory, coding and intron/exon junction sequences. Twenty four (24) SNPs were genotyped in a case/control sample and 12 SNPs in all pedigrees used for linkage analysis. Allelic, genotypic or family-based association studies suggest the presence of two susceptibility loci, the P2RX7 and CaMKK2 genes. The strongest association was observed in bipolar families at the non-synonymous SNP P2RX7-E13A (rs2230912, P-value = 0.000708), which results from an over-transmission of the mutant G-allele to affected offspring. This Gln460Arg polymorphism occurs at an amino acid that is conserved between humans and rodents and is located in the C-terminal domain of the P2X7 receptor, known to be essential for normal P2RX7 function.",

This study sought to determine whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CCR5 gene and their haplotypes were associated with susceptibility to and severity of RA. Three hundred fifty-seven patients with RA and 383 healthy unrelated controls were recruited. Using a pyrosequencing assay, we examined four polymorphisms -1118 CTAT(ins) (/del) (rs10577983), 303 A>G (rs1799987), 927 C>T (rs1800024), and 4838 G>T (rs1800874) of the CCR5 gene, which were distributed over the promoter region as well as the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. No significant difference in the genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies of the four selected SNPs was observed between RA patients and controls. CCR5 polymorphisms of -1118 CTAT(del) (P = 0.012; corrected P = 0.048) and 303 A>G (P = 0.012; corrected P = 0.048) showed a significant association with radiographic severity in a recessive model, and, as a result of multivariate logistic regression analysis, were found to be an independent predictor of radiographic severity. When we separated the erosion score from the total Sharp score, the statistical significance of CCR5 polymorphisms showed an increase; -1118 CTAT(ins) (/del) (P = 0.007; corrected P = 0.028) and 303 A>G (P = 0.007; corrected P = 0.028). Neither SNPs nor haplotypes of the CCR5 gene showed a significant association with joint space narrowing score. These results indicate that genetic polymorphisms of CCR5 are an independent risk factor for radiographic severity denoted by modified Sharp score, particularly joint erosion in RA.",

The polymorphisms in the MBD4 gene may be associated with differences in DNA repair capacity and thereby influence an individual's susceptibility to cervical cancer. To verify this hypothesis, we examined the potential association between the MBD4 Glu346Lys polymorphism (rs140693, G>A) and the risk of cervical cancer in a Chinese population.\n<b>Methods</b>: We genotyped the MBD4 Glu346Lys polymorphism in 146 cervical cancer cases and 320 healthy female subjects using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the genotypes and the risk of cervical cancer.\n<b>Results</b>: We observed a significantly decreased risk of cervical cancer associated with the heterozygous Lys/Glu genotype (odds ratio [OR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.99; P = 0.046) and the homozygous Glu/Glu genotype (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30-0.89; P = 0.018), compared with the Lys/Lys homozygotes. Moreover, the reduced cervical cancer risk was more predominant among younger subjects or human papillomavirus-positive individuals carrying Glu/Glu genotypes (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.78, P = 0.011; and OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09-0.75, P = 0.013, respectively).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The MBD4 codon 346 polymorphism may play a role in cervical cancer susceptibility in the Chinese population.

This rarely occurring problem could potentially render assignment of heterozygous genotypes uncertain. When the PCR conditions were studied, it was found that substitution of the dGTP nucleotide in the master mix by dGTP and dITP in proportion 1:1 largely overcame this problem. Heat denaturation of the DNA at 95 degrees C before PCR also counteracted the problem. A combination of these two modifications of the standard pyrosequencing PCR protocol gave the best results. We conclude that, with these modifications, the RFC1 c.80G>A SNP can be reliably assayed by pyrosequencing.",

However, various studies report different results of this association. The aim of the present work was to clarify the effects of IL-17A G197A (rs2275913) and IL-17F T7488C (rs763780) polymorphisms on cancer risk. We performed systematic searches of the PubMed and CNKI databases to obtain relevant publications. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the association of rs2275913 and rs763780 polymorphisms with cancer risk. Data were extracted from the selected studies, and statistical analysis was conducted using the STATA software. Our results indicated that rs2275913 and rs763780 polymorphisms significantly increase cancer risk, especially in gastric cancers. Subgroup analysis suggested the existence of a significant correlation between rs763780 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility in Caucasian populations. This updated meta-analysis confirms that rs2275913 and rs763780 polymorphisms are highly associated with increased risk for multiple forms of cancer.",

Among participants free of cardiovascular disease at baseline, 266 men and 249 women developed non-fatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD during 6 and 8 years of follow-up, respectively. In addition, 564 men had coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Using risk set sampling, controls were selected 2:1 matched on age, smoking, and date of blood draw.\n<b>Results</b>: The -4034CC genotype was related to an increased risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD compared with the AA genotype [relative risk (RR), men, 1.69; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99 to 2.89; women, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.20 to 3.49); however, this genotype was not related to risk of coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or to plasma adiponectin levels. Other SNPs or haplotypes defined by the 5 SNPs were not consistently related to risk of CHD in men and women or to plasma adiponectin levels.\n<b>Discussion</b>: Our study does not support the hypothesis that these 5 common SNPs in the adiponectin gene play an important role in the development of CHD among men and women, although we cannot exclude an association between the -4034CC genotype and risk of CHD.",

                "text": "The Type I Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC) has collected thousands of multiplex and simplex families with type I diabetes (T1D) with the goal of identifying genes involved in T1D susceptibility. These families have all been genotyped for the HLA class I and class II loci and a subset of samples has been typed for an major histocompatibility complex (MHC) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel. In addition, the T1DGC has genotyped SNPs in candidate genes to evaluate earlier reported T1D associations. Individual SNPs and SNP haplotypes in IL4R, which encodes the alpha-chain of the IL4 and IL13 receptors, have been associated with T1D in some reports, but not in others. In this study, 38 SNPs in IL4R were genotyped using the Sequenom iPLEX Gold MassARRAY technology in 2042 multiplex families from nine cohorts. Association analyses (transmission-disequilibrium test and parental-disequilibrium test) were performed on individual SNPs and on three-SNP haplotypes. Analyses were also stratified on the high-risk HLA DR3/DR4-DQB1*0302 genotype. A modest T1D association in HBDI families (n=282) was confirmed in this larger collection of HBDI families (n=424). The variant alleles at the non-synonymous SNPs (rs1805011 (E400A), rs1805012 (C431R), and rs1801275 (Q576R)), which are in strong linkage disequilibrium, were negatively associated with T1D risk. These SNPs were more associated with T1D among non-DR3/DR4-DQB1*0302 genotypes than DR3/DR4-DQB1*0302 genotypes. This association was stronger, both in terms of odds ratio and P-values, than the initial report of the smaller collection of HBDI families. However, the IL4R SNPs and the three-SNP haplotype containing the variant alleles were not associated with T1D in the total data. Thus, in the overall families, these results do not show evidence for an association of SNPs in IL4R with T1D.",

We conducted a case-control study to determine the potential associations between A419V and PD in Chinese population. Five hundred PD patients and 574 health controls were genotyped. Our results showed, A419V has a significantly higher frequency among PD patients than the controls (p = 0.025, odds ratio [OR] = 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.13-5.86]), especially in early-onset PD (p = 0.027, OR = 10.40, 95% CI [1.31-82.89]). And PD patients who carried A419V have a lower Minimum-Mental State Examination scores than PD patients who did not (p = 0.04). We also conducted a meta-analysis on A419V. In Asian population, A419V was detected at a significantly higher frequency among PD patients in contrast to controls: Z = 2.47, p = 0.01, OR = 2.11, 95% CI [1.17-3.82]. When only considering the Chinese population, the difference was more obvious with Z = 3.41, p = 0.0007, OR = 2.07, 95% CI [1.36-3.14]. The results suggest LRRK2 A419V appears to be a risk factor for PD in Asian, especially in early-onset patients. Finally, larger sample with centering on young or cognitive impairment PD patients in Asian would be preferable for further confirmation.",

The aim of our study was to perform a case-control association analysis of the TNF -308G/A polymorphism in a Polish sample of patients with SCH, BPAD and healthy controls.\n<b>Methods</b>: We genotyped the TNF -308G/A polymorphism (rs1800629) by PCR-RFLP in 348 patients with SCH, 361 patients with BPAD and in 351 controls.\n<b>Results</b>: We observed an association of the -308G allele with both SCH (p = 0.008) and BPAD (p = 0.039), and also with a positive family history in patients with SCH (p = 0.048) and BPAD (p = 0.027). For TNF genotypes, the association was only seen in SCH (p = 0.018).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our results may point to an association of the TNF -308G allele and -308G/G genotype with both SCH and BPAD, and to a relationship of the -308G allele with the risk of SCH and BPAD in patients with a positive family history. TNF could be potentially a susceptibility gene, shared between SCH and BPAD. Complex TNF gene studies--based on multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms and involving haplotype analysis--are necessary for the clarification of currently contradictory findings.",

                "text": "Mutations in cardiac transcription factor genes, such as GATA-4, NKX2-5 and TBX5 genes, have been associated to the patients with familial and isolated congenital heart disease (CHD). Little work has been done on the epigenetic causes for CHD. Sirtuis are highly conserved NAD-dependent class III deacetylases. In mammals, there are seven members of surtuin family, SIRT1-SIRT7. SIRT1, the closest to yeast Sir2, has deacetylase activity and ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. SIRT1 has been involved in many cellular processes and implicated in human diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesized that altered levels of SIRT1 gene expression, rather than mutations in SIRT1 gene, may contribute to the human diseases. In this study, we genetically analyze the SIRT1 gene promoter in patients with ventricular septal defects (VSD) (n=333) and ethic-matched healthy controls (n=348). In all, six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and twelve heterozygous sequence variants were identified. Four novel heterozygous variants, g.69643693A>G, g.69643963A>T, g.69643971G>A and g.69644366Ins, were found in six VSD patients, but in none of controls. Six SNPs and variants, g.69643707A>C (rs35706870), g.69643874C>A, g.69644209C>G, g.69644213G>A, g.69644268T>A and g.69644441G>A, were only identified in controls. The other SNPs and variants were found in both groups with similar frequencies. Therefore, the variants within the SIRT1 gene promoter identified in VSD patients may alter the transcriptional activities of SIRT1 gene promoter. Changed SIRT1 protein levels may contribute to the VSD etiology by affecting the activities of its substrates.",

This study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis for examining the relationship between <i>CD226</i> rs763361 polymorphism and ADs risk. <b>Methods</b>: a literature search was performed to identify relevant studies published in Embase, PubMed, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. In the most appropriate genetic models, pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for evaluating the strength of the associations. Besides standard meta-analysis, cumulative meta-analysis was also conducted to assess the trend in OR over time. Also, we performed subgroup and sensitivity analysis, and checked for the heterogeneity and publication bias. <b>Results</b>: Twenty-nine reports with 51 independent studies, comprising 18157 cases and 29904 controls, were enrolled in this meta-analysis. Among overall and various ethnic populations (Europeans, Asians, Africans, and South Americans), <i>CD226</i> rs763361 polymorphism was significantly associated with ADs susceptibility; in the subgroup analysis by disease type, rs763361 polymorphism revealed significant associations with the risk of RA, SLE, T1D, and MS. The sensitivity analysis and cumulative meta-analysis confirmed the stability and robustness of these significant results. However, no evidence of stable significant association emerged in the subgroup analysis of SSc. <b>Conclusion</b>: These findings demonstrate that <i>CD226</i> rs763361 polymorphism confers susceptibility to ADs in the overall population, Europeans, Asians, Africans, and South Americans. rs763361 polymorphism in <i>CD226</i> gene may be a potential susceptible predictor of ADs especially RA, SLE, T1D, and MS.",

The interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene and its single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with asthma susceptibility in children. A case-control study was performed to evaluate the relationship between asthma risk and the IL-4 rs2243250 (589 C/T) and rs2070874 (107 T/C), and IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) rs1801275 (576 Q/R) polymorphisms in 317 childhood asthma patients and 351 healthy children as controls. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing was performed. The effects of interactions between the genes of interest and environmental factors were also analyzed. IL-4 rs2243250 and rs2070874 allele and genotype frequencies did not significantly differ between the asthma and control groups (P > 0.05), but those of IL-4R rs1801275 did (P < 0.05). The RR genotype and R allele of this IL-4R variant were significantly associated with asthma risk, with odds ratios (ORs; and 95% confidence intervals) of 2.97 (2.08-4.25) and 2.99 (2.32-3.85), respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that the IL-4R 576 Q/R RR genotype demonstrated a positive interaction with environments associated with smoking or pets in its effect on asthma risk, with ORs of 2.18 (P = 0.02) and 2.29 (P = 0.01), respectively. Our results suggest that the IL-4R rs1801275 polymorphism is associated with childhood asthma, and the RR genotype confers a high risk of developing this condition. This variant exhibited positive interactions with environments in which smoking or pets were present in increasing the risk of childhood asthma.",

Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzymes are key components of cellular defense against oxidative stress. The present study aimed to clarify the association between polymorphisms in GST and risk of essential hypertension using a meta-analysis of published studies. PubMed-Medline, Ovid-EMBASE, HuGE Navigator and SCOPUS databases were searched to identify case-control studies that examined the association of GST polymorphisms and hypertension. Data were extracted using standardized methods. Combined odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of polymorphisms with hypertension were calculated using a fixed effect approach and under dominant, recessive, additive and overdominant models of inheritance. A total of 12 studies comprising 2,040 cases and 2,462 controls fulfilled the inclusion criteria. GSTM1 (presence/null), GSTT1 (presence/null) and GSTP1 (Ile105Val; rs1695) polymorphisms were evaluated. Meta-analysis revealed significant associations between the null genotypes of GSTM1 (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08-1.39; p=0.002) and GSTT1 (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.13-1.50; p=0.0003) and risk of hypertension. The observed associations were robust in sensitivity analyses. However, no significant association was found for the rs1695 polymorphism under all assessed modes of inheritance. Findings of the present meta-analysis demonstrated that GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes may serve as predisposing factors for essential hypertension. Further studies are warranted to validate this association, and also to explore if these null genotypes are in linkage with other hypertension susceptibility polymorphisms.",

Our aim was to investigate the gene polymorphism and MCP-1 plasma levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n<b>Methods</b>: Family-based and case-control association analyses of the -A2518G polymorphism (rs1024611) were performed in 1,936 subjects (770 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 316 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 302 healthy relatives (151 CD trios), and 548 healthy controls (HCs)). Extensive gene sequencing was also undertaken, and a further six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 435 CD patients and 189 HCs. MCP-1 protein plasma levels in 234 CD patients, 117 UC patients, and 108 HCs were assessed by an immunosorbent assay.\n<b>Results</b>: Five SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (D'>0.85) were associated with CD, with the strongest signal found at the -A2518G SNP. The frequency of the G allele was significantly lower in CD patients (22.1%), compared with HCs (29.8%), both at case-control (P=6 x 10(-6)) and at transmission disequilibrium test analyses (T/U 41/88; P=4 x 10(-4)). No difference in alleles (26.1%) and genotype frequencies were found in UC patients. MCP-1 plasma levels in CD and UC patients were similar to those in HCs (P=0.38), irrespective of disease activity, or MCP-1 genotypes. However, 30 CD (13%) and 20 UC patients (17%) with extensive colonic involvement had plasma levels significantly higher than HCs (P=0.02).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The -A2518G polymorphism seems to be associated with CD but does not influence MCP-1 plasma levels, which in contrast are increased in UC and CD with extensive colonic involvement.",

Moreover, impulsivity is considered to be a predictor of poor treatment outcomes. Few studies, however, have directly examined the genetics of impulsivity in alcohol-dependent patients. We analyzed the relationships between a well-recognized genetic marker of serotonin activity and levels of impulsivity as measured by both the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and the stop-signal task among 304 alcohol-dependent patients. The stop-signal task was used as an independent, objective method of estimating the level of behavioral impulsivity, and the BIS-11 as a self-report measure of global impulsivity. Blood was collected and analyzed for the T102C (rs6313) polymorphism in the serotonin type 2A receptor gene (HTR2A). Our results indicate a significant association between high levels of behavioral impulsivity and the C/C genotype of rs6313 in alcohol-dependent patients. The CC genotype has been previously found to be associated with a reduction in 5HT2A receptors in the central nervous system. These results support the hypothesis that genetic factors are important determinants of behavioral impulsivity in alcohol-dependent patients, and that the serotonin system plays an important role in establishing its level.",

In the discovery stage, 11 COPD from five families were subjected to whole-genome sequencing, and 21 common polymorphisms in MMPs and TIMPs were identified. These polymorphisms were genotyped in two subsequent verification studies. Of these polymorphisms, c.2392G>A (rs2664370T>C) and c.4158C>A (rs2664369T>G) in MMP16 remained significantly different. Functionally, we found that MMP16 expression was significantly increased in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) from COPD and in cigarette smoke extract-treated 16HBE cells compared with controls. This was also shown by bioinformatics analysis. COPD carrying rs2664370CC showed decreased levels of MMP16 in the plasma and in PBMCs compared with those carrying CT and TT. Treatment with hsa-miR-576-5p mimics led to a greater reduction in luciferase reporter activity in cells transfected with rs2664370CC. Moreover, blood levels of base excess, PCO<sub>2</sub> , and PO<sub>2</sub> in COPD with rs2664370CC were significantly lower than those with rs2664370CT+TT. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the rs2664370T>C polymorphism in MMP16 protects against the risk of COPD, likely by favoring interaction with hsa-miR-576-5p, leading to reduced MMP16 expression and improved blood gas levels.",

Nitric oxide (NO) promotes vasodilatation and prevents Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Pin1 suppresses NO production by down-regulating the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Whether the genetic polymorphisms of the PIN1 gene (encoding Pin1) are implicated in CAD deserves investigations in human beings.\n<b>Methods</b>: A total of 210 CAD patients and control individuals (all females) were enrolled, and their genotypes of rs2233679 (-667C/T, a key SNP in the promoter of PIN1 gene) were sequenced. T-test, chi-square test, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to evaluate Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, varied genetic distribution and relative CAD risk.\n<b>Results</b>: The differences in age, BMI, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density and high density cholesterol between the CAD and control groups were not significant (all P>0.05), and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed in the two groups (both P>0.05). The frequency of -667T allele in the CAD group was higher than that in the control group. The genotype -667TT elicited a higher hazardous risk of CAD compared to the genotype -667CC (OR=1.85, 95% CI: 0.75-4.53) as well as the genotypes CC+CT (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 0.86-4.49).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: We firstly show that the allele -667T in the PIN1 promoter may elicit a higher CAD-risk than -667C, and the -667TT genotype of PIN1 may be a new genetic biomarker for increased incidence of CAD. These novel observations put forward a new understanding of the PIN1-CAD genetic relationship in humans, potentially contributing to both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders.",

We aimed at studying the involvement of IL23R in celiac disease (CD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). We performed a case-control study including 598 patients with CD, 414 with MS and 546 healthy controls, all of them white Spaniards. All samples were genotyped for two single nucleotide polymorphisms: rs7517847 and rs11209026 (Arg381Gln). Statistical analyses were performed using chi(2-)tests or the Fisher's exact test. The minor allele (Gln) of the coding variant Arg381Gln was significantly increased in CD and MS patients when compared to controls (8% in CD vs 6% in controls, P=0.02; 9% in MS, P=0.006). In MS, a stronger effect was observed in patients showing primary-progressive disease (16%, P=0.004). Moreover, heterozygotes for rs7517847 were significantly increased in this group of MS patients (81% in MS vs 48% in controls, P=0.0002). In conclusion, contrary to what has been described previously, the less frequent allele of the functional polymorphism Arg381Gln (rs11209026) seems to be increasing susceptibility to CD and MS, although in this last group of patients a stronger effect is observed in patients affected of a primary-progressive form.",

                "text": "<b>Rationale</b>: A common polymorphism, Val158Met, alters catechol- O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme activity and has been linked to psychiatric phenotypes. Bray et al. (2003) reported that COMT is subject to differential allele expression in brain, finding modest (13-22%) underexpression of a haplotype containing Val158. However, disparate findings by another group who used the same method, but in lymphoblasts, raise the issues of tissue specificity, magnitude of differential expression, and identity of loci altering expression.\n<b>Objectives</b>: We measured COMT allele expression ratios in heterozygous human lymphoblast cell lines and brains.\n<b>Methods</b>: Using transcribed single nucleotide polymorphisms as endogenous reporters, we developed an RT-coupled 5' nuclease assay for allele expression ratios and applied it to 63 COMT rs4818(C>G) heterozygotes and 68 Val158Met [rs4680(G>A)] heterozygotes.\n<b>Results</b>: For rs4818(C>G), the C allele was overexpressed relative to the G allele in 18 of 27 lymphoblast lines and 23 of 36 brains. For Val158Met, Met158 was overexpressed relative to Val158 in all (29 of 29) lymphoblast lines and all (39 of 39) brains. Each of the 22 rs4818 heterozygotes without differential allele expression was a Val158/Val158 homozygote. The Met158 allele was overexpressed by 65-77% when compared with Val158 in lymphoblasts and brain. Haplotype augmented ability to predict expression in brain only. However, the expression of the Val158 allele on the high-expressing haplotype was only 19% higher than Val158 alleles on the other haplotype background.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: COMT alleles are differentially expressed. The Met158 allele predicts higher mRNA expression in both brain and lymphoblasts. As exemplified here, the RT-coupled 5' nuclease assay is a reliable method for the quantitative evaluation of cis-acting regulatory effects.",

Fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP 2) is responsible for transport of free fatty acids in the intestinal endothelium cells. FABP2-genetic variants might affect plasma lipid concentrations and intracellular lipid transport. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between FABP2 Ala54Thr genetic polymorphism and metabolic syndrome and some biochemical and anthropological parameters in elderly subjects.\n<b>Materials And Methods</b>: This cross-sectional study included 140 men and 176 women older than 70 years. Fasting serum concentration of glucose, lipid parameters, total proteins and C-reactive protein were determined by standardized methods. Presence (MetS(+)) or absence (MetS(-)) of MetS was determined according to criteria of the International Diabetes Federation. FABP2 genetic polymorphism Ala54Thr (rs1799883) was genotyped with PCR-RFPL.\n<b>Results</b>: The genotype frequencies for Ala/Ala, Ala/Thr and Thr/Thr genotype were 60, 36 and 6 in MetS(-), and 131, 70 and 13 in MetS(+), respectively, without statistical significance (P = 0.567). Ala/Ala genotype was a subgroup of non-carriers, while Ala/Thr and Thr/Thr genotypes were Thr54-carriers. Median triglyceride concentration was significantly lower in carriers then in non-carriers for whole MetS(+) group (P = 0.050); there were no significant difference between men with MetS (P = 0.144), but there was a difference between women with MetS (P = 0.020). T-test showed that mean HDL cholesterol concentrations in MetS(+) group for Thr54-carriers was significantly higher in whole group (P = 0.001), and for both genders (men P = 0.039; women P = 0.004) as compared to non-carriers.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: FABP2 genetic polymorphism is associated with lower triglyceride and higher HDL-cholesterol concentrations in elderly subjects with MetS. This genetic variation might be a useful marker for understanding dyslipidemia in MetS.",

The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of the OPRM1 A118G polymorphism (rs1799971) in Turkish population and to investigate its association with opioid and other substance addiction. In addition, we examined the association of rs1799971 in addicted patients who were also diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. The study included 103 patients addicted to opioids, cocaine, ecstasy, alcohol, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), cannabis, and sedative/hypnotic substances and 83 healthy volunteers with similar demographic features as controls. rs1799971 polymorphisms were identified with the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFLP). The genotype frequencies were significantly higher in the addicted patients than controls (32.0 % vs 16.9 %, respectively; p=0.027). The prevalence of the G allele was 16.1 % in the addicted group and 8.4 % in the control group (p=0.031). Our study confirmed the association between the rs1799971(G) allele frequency and opioid and other substance addiction, but not with psychiatric disorders.",

KDR -604C/1192G/1719A, -604C/1192G/1719T, -604C/1192G, -604C/1719A, and -604C/1719T haplotype frequencies were higher in RSA patients (OR = 1.778, 2.659, 2.089, 1.678, and 1.806, respectively), whereas -604T/1192G/1719A, -604T/1192G, and -604T/1719A haplotype frequencies were lower in RSA patients (OR = 2.422, 2.611, and 2.216, respectively). No association was found between RSA and KDR 1192G\u2192A or 1719A\u2192T.\n<b>Conclusion(s)</b>: An association between the KDR -604T\u2192C polymorphism and RSA was found in Korean women. Carriers of the -604C variant allele were more frequent among RSA patients than among controls, suggesting that KDR -604C may confer RSA risk. The association of 1719A\u2192T with RSA that was found in Taiwanese Han women was not observed in Korean women.",

The DNA was extracted from blood samples, and the SNP rs1045642 was assessed by Real Time PCR (qPCR). Risk factors for acquiring the virus and the SVR after HCV treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin were also analyzed.\n<b>Results</b>: Among the patients, 54 (54.5%) were male and 45 (45.5%) were female. The average age was 46.1\u00b19.8 years. The SVR after HCV treatment was 40%. The frequencies of MDR1 genotypes CC, CT and TT were 28.3%, 47.5% and 24.2%, respectively. Allele frequencies were 52% for the C allele and 48% for the T allele. No association was found for SNP rs1045642 (C3435T) regarding response to treatment (P=0.308).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: - In this study, the C3435T polymorphism in the MDR1 gene appears not to be associated with SVR in HCV-HIV co-infected individuals.",

Despite extensive research on the roles of folate-metabolism-related gene polymorphisms in the pathophysiology of many diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancers, and sudden sensorineural hearing loss, little is known about their association with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease (MD). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphisms (C677T and A1298C) on the risk of MD in a Japanese population. We examined the C677T and A1298C (rs1801133 and rs1801131) polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene and compared them between 1946 adults (986 men and 960 women) participating in the National Institute for Longevity Sciences Longitudinal Study of Aging and 86 cases of MD. A multiple logistic regression was performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of MD regarding the MTHFR polymorphisms before (model 1) and after (model 2) adjustment for age and sex factors. The OR of MTHFR C677T for the risk of MD was 0.669 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.479-0.934) in model 1 and 0.680 (95% CI, 0.484-0.954) in model 2. In contrast, the OR of MTHFR A1298C for the risk of MD was 1.503 (95% CI, 1.064-2.123) in model 1 and 1.505 (95% CI, 1.045-2.167) in model 2. Our results imply that the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms are associated with the risk of MD.",

This study aimed to evaluate the association of NFKBIA -826C>T (rs2233406) and -881A>G (rs3138053) polymorphisms with the risk of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) in Malaysian population. A case-control study comprising 474 subjects (237 CRC patients and 237 cancer-free controls) was carried out. The polymorphisms were genotyped from the genomic DNA of the study subjects employing PCR-RFLP, followed by DNA sequencing. The association between the polymorphic genotypes and CRC risk was evaluated by deriving odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using unconditional logistic regression analysis. The two polymorphisms were in complete and perfect linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1.0, r (2) = 1.0). Overall, no statistically significant CRC risk association was found for the polymorphisms (P > 0.05). A similar lack of association was observed when the data were stratified according to ethnicity (P > 0.05). However, stratification by gender revealed a significant inverse association between the heterozygous genotype of the polymorphisms and the risk of CRC among females (OR 0.53, 95 % CI 0.29-0.97, P = 0.04), but not among males (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the heterozygous genotype of the polymorphisms could contribute to a significantly decreased CRC risk among females, but not males, in the Malaysian population.",

Quetiapine is metabolized by CYP3A enzymes including CYP3A5 and is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, an efflux drug transporter encoded by the ABCB1 gene. We assessed the effects of ABCB1 [c.1236C>T (rs1128503), c.2677G>T/A (rs2032582), c.3435C>T (rs1045642)] and CYP3A5*3 (6986A>G) (rs776746) polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine in humans.\n<b>Materials And Methods</b>: Forty healthy male individuals were enrolled, and their ABCB1 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms were assessed. After a single dose of 100 mg quetiapine was administered, plasma concentrations of quetiapine were measured for 24 h and pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out.\n<b>Results</b>: The ABCB1 polymorphisms including c.1236C>T, c.2677G>T/A, and c.3435C>>T did not affect plasma levels of quetiapine, and its pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ among ABCB1 genotype groups. However, the CYP3A5*3 polymorphism significantly affected the plasma level of quetiapine and its pharmacokinetics. The peak plasma concentration of quetiapine was 208.39 ng/ml for CYP3A5*1/*1, 243.46 ng/ml for CYP3A5*1/*3, and 332.94 ng/ml for CYP3A5*3/*3 (P=0.0118). The mean AUC(inf) (area under the time vs. concentration curve from 0 to infinity) value was 627.3, 712.77, and 1045.29 ng h/ml, respectively (P=0.0017).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: The results indicated that the genetic polymorphism of CYP3A5*3 but not ABCB1 significantly influences the plasma level of quetiapine and its pharmacokinetics. These findings suggest that the CYP3A5 genetic polymorphism affects the disposition of quetiapine and provide a plausible explanation for interindividual variation in the disposition of this drug.",

However, the risk factors for the transformation of migraine to MOH are still not clear. We investigated gene polymorphisms, personality traits, and characteristics of headache and lifestyle in 47 migraine patients (aged 36.4 \u00b1 10.3) and 22 MOH patients (aged 39.6 \u00b1 9.9) who progressed from migraine and made a scoring system for a predictive index (PI) of the onset of MOH in patients with migraine. By multivariate logistic stepwise regression analysis, type of migraine, regular and sufficient dietary intake, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T (rs1801133) and dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) C939T (rs6275) polymorphisms were selected as significant factors that contribute independently to the development from migraine to MOH (P < 0.05). The regression coefficients (\u03b2) of these four selected factors were approximated and scored. The PI score in MOH patients (7.32 \u00b1 1.60) was significantly higher than that in migraine patients (4.62 \u00b1 1.83, P < 0.001).

In the stratified analysis, significant associations were found between the LEPR K109R(rs1137100) genetic polymorphism and breast cancer under additive genetic model (odds ratio/OR=0.67, 95% CI 0.61-0.73). For prostate cancer, there was no significant association of LEPR K109R(rs1137100) variant with this disease under any model. For lung cancer, there was significant association of LEPR K109R(rs1137100) variant with the disease under heterozygous co-dominant model (OR=0.72, 95% CI 0.55- 0.96), recessive genetic model (OR=0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.94) and additive genetic model (OR=0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.99). For gastric cancer, significant association was found in the 3 genetic models (AG vs GG, AA/AG vs GG and A vs G), the ORS (95%CI) being 2.93 (1.25-6.86), 2.93 (1.25-6.86) and 2.25 (1.07-4.72), respectively. Moreover, no significant cancer risk was found in any genetic model among Caucasian and Asian populations. When stratified by study design, no significantly elevated susceptibility to cancer was found among any studies. No significant differences in the genotype method and sample size in cases were found among genotypes.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: These findings suggested that the LEPR K109R(rs1137100) genetic polymorphism may decrease the susceptibility in breast cancer, especially in the additive genetic model. The findings also indicate that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) functions as a recessive mutation, which needs to be verified or linked with functional studies.",

The most common and presumed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detected in the Growth Differentiation Factor 9 gene is c.1189G>A (rs637044681, Ensembl) which results in an altered sequence of the encoded protein. In some studies, there was no effect of this SNP on litter size, while in other studies there was an effect. In the present study there was a meta-analysis conducted by pooling results from 11 eligible published studies to investigate effects of c.1189G>A polymorphism on litter size using four different genetic models including dominant (AA + AG compared with GG), recessive (AA compared with AG + GG), additive (AA compared with GG) and co-dominant (AA + GG compared with AG). Data were analyzed using fixed and random-effect models based on the I-squared value. Results indicate the c.1189G>A polymorphism is positively associated with litter size with use of the dominant model (SMD = 0.093, 95% CI = 0.028 to 0.158, P-Value = 0.005).

Overall, the mean change in VA from baseline was +3.2 \u00b1 14.9 letters at 12 months. The AA (homozygote risk) genotype at rs11200638 - HTRA1 promoter SNP (P = 0.001) and GG (homozygote risk) genotype at rs10490924 (A69S) in LOC387715/ARMS2 (P = 0.002) were each significantly associated with poorer VA outcome at 12 months after multiple correction. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation change in VA from baseline in patients with AA genotype at rs11200638 was -2.9 \u00b1 15.2 letters after 12 months compared with +5.1 \u00b1 14.1 letters in patients with AG or GG genotypes at this SNP. Patients with either of these genotypes were also significantly more likely to lose >15 letters after 12 months. SNPs rs11200638 and rs10490924 were in high linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.92). None of the other examined SNPs was associated with outcome.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The HTRA1 promoter SNP (rs11200638) and A69S at LOC387715/ARMS2 were associated with a poorer visual outcome for ranibizumab or bevacizumab treatment in neovascular AMD, suggesting strong pharmacogenetic associations with anti-VEGF treatment. This finding could aid in applying more individualized treatment regimens based on patients' genotype to achieve optimal treatment response in AMD.\n<b>Financial Disclosure(s)</b>: The authors have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.",

However, this finding has not been evaluated in other populations such as Latin-Americans, except for Colombians. On the other hand, <i>BANK1</i> single nucleotide variants (SNVs) have been scarcely studied in RA patients.\n<b>Objective</b>: The aim of this study was to determine whether the BLK rs2736340T/C, rs13277113A/G, and BANK1 rs10516487G/A (R61H) and rs3733197G/A (A383T) polymorphisms are risk factors to RA in a sample of patients from Central Mexico.\n<b>Materials And Methods</b>: We studied 957 women; 487 controls and 470 patients with RA by means of a TaqMan\u00ae SNP genotyping assay with fluorescent probes for the <i>BLK</i> rs13277113A/G, rs2736340T/C and <i>BANK1</i> 10516487G/A (R61H) and rs3733197G/A (A383T) variants.\n<b>Result</b>: The <i>BLK</i> rs2736340T/C and rs13277113A/G variants were associated with risk for RA: C vs T; OR 1.39, <i>p</i> = 0.001, and G vs A; OR 1.37, <i>p</i> = 0.004, respectively. In addition, there was also an association between <i>BANK1</i> R61H and RA: A vs G; OR 1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.003, but no with <i>BANK1</i> A383T. We also identified an interaction significant between genotypes of <i>BLK</i> rs2736340T/C-<i>BANK1</i> rs10516487G/A and RA: OR 1.65, <i>p</i> = 0.0001.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our data suggest that both <i>BLK</i> and <i>BANK1</i> confer susceptibility to RA in Mexican patients. The individual association of <i>BANK1</i> rs1054857G/A with RA had not been previously reported in a particular population (except for pooled patients from several countries), therefore, our study presents the first evidence of association between this <i>BANK1</i> variant and RA.",

                "text": "Dysregulation of glutamate neurotransmission is implicated in the pathphysiology of schizophrenia. Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) package glutamate into vesicles in the presynaptic terminal and regulate the release of glutamate. Abnormal VGLUT1 expression has been linked to schizophrenia in postmortem brain studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of the human VGLUT1 in the susceptibility to schizophrenia. In this study, we searched for genetic variants in the putative core promoter region and 12 exons (including UTR ends) of the VGLUT1 gene using direct sequencing in a sample of Han Chinese schizophrenic patients (n=376) and non-psychotic controls (n=368) from Taiwan, and conducted a case-control association study. We identified two common SNPs (g.-248G>C (ss159695612) and c.2697C>A (rs1043558)) in the VGLUT1 gene. No differences in the allele and genotype frequencies were detected between the patients and control subjects. Besides, we identified eight patient-specific rare variants in 16 out of 376 patients, including two variants (g.-296A>G (ss159695611) and g.-32Cv>T (ss159695613)) at the core promoter region and 5'UTR, two missense variants (L516M (ss159695617) and P551S (ss159695618)) and three silent variants (E24E (ss159695614), L118L (ss159695615), and P133P (ss159695616)) at protein-coding regions, and one variant (c.2201G>A (ss159695619)) at the 3'UTR. No rare variants were found in 368 control subjects (4.3% versus 0, P=1.5x10(-5)). Although the functional significance of these rare variants remains to be characterized, our study may lend support to the multiple rare mutation hypothesis of schizophrenia, and may provide genetic clues to indicate the involvement of the glutamate transmission pathway in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.",

In this study, we further investigated the role of Asp1104His (rs17655 G > C) in <i>XPG</i> on CRC risk. We genotyped the rs17655 G > C polymorphism in Chinese population comprising 1019 CRC cases and 1036 cancer-free controls. We also performed a meta-analysis to further assess the association. Overall, no significant association was detected between the rs17655 G > C and the risk of CRC. Stratified analysis also revealed no significant association. To further elucidate the association of the rs17655 with CRC susceptibility, we conducted a meta-analysis by including qualified publications and the current study. The meta-analysis results demonstrated that rs17655 G > C was associated with an increased CRC risk (CG vs. GG: OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.01-1.28; CC/CG vs. GG: OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01-1.24; C vs. G: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01-1.11). In subgroup analysis, the significant association between the rs17655 C allele and CRC risk was found in Asians and hospital-based subgroups. Taken together, our results suggested that the <i>XPG</i> rs17655 G > C polymorphism is a low-penetrance susceptibility locus for CRC. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings.",

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of CD209 (-336 A/G; rs4804803) affects transcription and is associated with the severity of tuberculosis and dengue fever. Because CD209 binds hepatitis C virus (HCV) glycoprotein-E2, we investigated this SNP in the context of chronic HCV infection. A total of 131 Irish women who had received HCV-contaminated anti-D-immunoglobulin and 79 healthy control subjects were genotyped. We found no association between rs4804803 and the risk of HCV chronicity. However, of those with chronic infection, possession of at least one g-allele was associated with more advanced liver disease, with significantly higher liver fibrosis scores and levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) observed. We conclude that rs4804803, an SNP in the CD209 promoter, contributes to severity of liver disease in chronic HCV infection.",

Recently pharmacological studies suggested a role of the serotonin (5-HT) 3 receptor in schizophrenia. The 5-HT3 receptors are the only ligand-gated ion channels within the 5-HT receptor family. Applying an endophenotype approach, we investigated a potential impact of the genes of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits as well as the novel 5-HT3C, 5-HT3D, and 5-HT3E subunits on CPT performance in subjects with schizophrenia. The study included 196 patients with schizophrenia, 113 of their parents, and 205 healthy controls recruited from community registers. Sustained attention was assessed with the Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs (CPT-IP). Assessing functional and coding variants of the 5-HT3 receptor subunit genes, we found the GG genotype of the 5-HT3E subunit gene (rs7627615; Thr86Ala) to be associated with better attentional capacities in subjects with schizophrenia and healthy controls. This study provides additional evidence for a role of the serotonergic system and the 5-HT3 receptor in schizophrenia.",

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), is a growth and hypoxia-induced factor which contributes to the regulation of various processes. The present study has investigated the association of the placental VEGF -634G/C (rs2010963), -1154G/A (rs1570360), and -2549 I/D (18bpindel) polymorphisms in the promoter region with VEGF mRNA expression in PE women and control group.\n<b>Methods</b>: This case-control study was performed on the placenta of 84 PE women and 103 controls after delivery. Genotyping of the VEGF polymorphisms was done by PCR or PCR, PCR-RFLP or sequencing methods. The mRNA expression levels were measured by Quantitative Real-Time PCR.\n<b>Results</b>: The relative mRNA expression of VEGF gene was significantly higher in PE women compared to controls. The relative mRNA expression of VEGF gene was significantly higher in women with -634CC genotype compared to CG + GG genotypes in PE women and total studied women but not in control women. However, there was no association between the placental VEGF -1154G/A and -2549 I/D polymorphisms and VEGF mRNA expression neither in PE nor in control groups.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: The current study found higher mRNA expression of placental VEGF gene in PE women. The mRNA expression of the placental VEGF gene has been up-regulated in the placenta of women with -634CC genotype. No association was found between the placental VEGF -1154G/A and -2549 I/D polymorphisms and VEGF mRNA expression.",

Twelve SNPs were identified in MTHFR, MTR, and MTRR in the 927 case-control samples, which included 165 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1), 167 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 and 3 (CIN2/3), 155 cervical cancer patients, and 440 normal controls. The frequencies of the genotypes and haplotypes were assessed in the controls, CINs, and cervical cancers. Individual carriers of the variant allele C of MTHFR A1298C (rs1801131) had a 0.64-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42-0.98] decreased risk for CIN2/3 compared with common homozygotes. However, no significant association was found between most other variants and cervical cancer risk. The results also identified an increased CIN1 risk in carriers with at least one copy of haplotype 3 in the MTHFR gene (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% CI: 1.03-3.42). In conclusion, there was no significant association between most SNPs in MTHFR, MTR, or MTRR and the risk of CIN and cervical cancer in Korean women. In addition, there was no significant association of MTHFR haplotypes with risk of CIN2/3 and cervical cancer.",

                "text": "The incidence of type-1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) has increased steadily in Kuwait during recent years and it is now considered amongst the high-incidence countries. An interaction between susceptibility genes, immune system mediators and environmental factors predispose susceptible individuals to T1DM. We have determined the prevalence of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene functional variant (C1858T; R620W, rs2476601), HLA-DQ and DR alleles and three autoantibodies in Kuwaiti children with T1DM to evaluate their impact on genetic predisposition of the disease. This study included 253 Kuwaiti children with T1DM and 214 ethnically matched controls. The genotypes of PTPN22 gene functional variant C1858T (R620W; rs2476601) were detected by PCR-RFLP method and confirmed by DNA sequencing. HLA-DQ and DR alleles were determined by sequence-specific PCR. Three autoantibodies were detected in the T1DM patients using radio-immunoassays. A significant association was detected between the variant genotype of the PTPN22 gene (C1858T, rs2476601) and T1DM in Kuwaiti Arabs. HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 alleles showed a strong association with T1DM. In T1DM patients which carried the variant TT-genotype of the PTPN22 gene, 93% had at least one DQ2 allele and 60% carried either a DQ2 or a DQ8 allele. Amongst the DR alleles, the DR3-DRB5, DR3-3, DR3-4 and DR4-4 showed a strong association with T1DM. Majority of T1DM patients who carried homozygous variant (TT) genotype of the PTPN22 gene had either DR3-DRB5 or DRB3-DRB4 genotypes. In T1DM patients who co-inherited the high risk HLA DQ, DR alleles with the variant genotype of PTPN22 gene, the majority were positive for three autoantibodies. Our data demonstrate that the variant T-allele of the PTPN22 gene along with HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 alleles constitute significant determinants of genetic predisposition of T1DM in Kuwaiti children.",

An inflammatory component plays a role in pathogenesis of both atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation, the most important risk factor of embolic strokes. C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration in blood reflects the inflammatory process. Concentration of this protein depends on the CRP gene polymorphism. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between selected risk factors of stroke and variant of -717A>G (rs2794521) CRP gene polymorphism in population of West Pomerania Province of Poland.\n<b>Materials And Methods</b>: There were 125 consecutive patients with ischaemic stroke analysed, who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In all patients, -717A>G CRP gene polymorphism was genotyped and analysed in relation to selected stroke risk factors.\n<b>Results</b>: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes was lower in patients with AA genotype of -717A>G CRP gene polymorphism than in patients with other alleles (p=0.017). Subjects with GG genotype had significantly higher concentration of CRP comparing to AG genotype (p=0.023). No correlation was found between -717A>G CRP gene polymorphism and the lipid profile and other selected risk factors of stroke.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: In patients with ischaemic stroke in West Pomerania Province, the GG genotype of -717A>G CRP gene polymorphism is associated with significantly higher CRP concentration in relation to AG genotype. Patients with AA genotype may be characterised by lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes.",

The aim of this study was to determine if proposed functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GTP cyclohydrolase (GCH1) and mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) genes previously associated with pain sensitivity affect susceptibility to chronic widespread pain (CWP). Pain data was collected using body manikins via questionnaire at three time-points over a four year period from subjects aged 25-65 in the North-West of England as part of a population based cohort study, EPIFUND. CWP was defined at each time point using standard criteria. Three SNPs forming a proposed \"pain-protective\" haplotype in GCH1 (rs10483639, rs3783641 and rs8007267) and two SNPs in OPRM1 (rs1777971 (A118G) and rs563649) were genotyped in cases with persistent CWP (CWP present at >or=2 time-points) and controls who were pain-free at all time-points. The expectation-maximisation algorithm was used to estimate haplotype frequencies. The frequency of the \"pain-protective\" (CAT - C allele of rs10483639, A allele of rs3783641 and T allele of rs8007267) haplotype was compared to the frequency of the other haplotypes between cases and controls using the chi2 test. Allele frequencies and carriage of the minor allele was compared between cases and controls using chi2 tests for the OPRM1 SNPs. The frequency of the proposed GCH1 \"pain-protective\" haplotype (CAT) did not significantly differ between cases and controls and no significant associations were observed between the OPRM1 SNPs and CWP. In conclusion, there was no evidence of association between proposed functional SNPs, previously reported to influence pain sensitivity, in GCH1 and OPRM1 with CWP. Further evidence of null association in large independent cohorts is required to truly exclude these SNPs as genetic risk factors for CWP.",

Combined risk due to GA+AA genotypes was 2.12 (P=0.002; 95% confidence interval=1.3-3.3; P-trend=0.001). Sub-grouping showed a risk due to the PTGS2 -1195(GA+AA) genotype in males (P=0.007; odds ratio=2.97; 95% confidence interval=1.3-6.5), patients without gallstones (P=0.001; odds ratio=2.53; 95% confidence interval=1.4-4.7) and with late-onset gallbladder cancer (P=0.012; odds ratio=1.99; 95% confidence interval=1.1-3.4).

Profilin 1 gene (PFN1) has been identified as a causative gene, which accounts for 1% to 2% of familial ALS. In this study, we investigated the mutation spectrum of PFN1 in Chinese patients with ALS. A total of 550 ALS patients (including 540 sporadic ALS [SALS] and 10 familial ALS) from the Department of Neurology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, were recruited for the study. From the same region, 545 healthy control individuals (HC) were recruited as a control group. The encoding regions of the PFN1 gene were screened by direct sequencing. Novel candidate mutations or variations were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. A novel nonsynonymous p.R136W mutation was identified in an early-onset SALS female patient. A novel synonymous mutation p.L88L detected in a late-onset SALS female patient was considered nonpathogenic, as it was also detected in a control subject. No mutations were found in 10 familial ALS patients. Moreover, we found a significant difference in the genotype distribution of reported rs13204 (p.L112L) between SALS patients and HC (p = 0.0030). The frequency of minor allele 'T' of rs13204 in the SALS group was significantly lower than that in HC (p = 0.0040, OR = 0.7270, 95% CI = 0.5848-0.9039). Our results suggest that PFN1 mutation is an uncommon cause of ALS in the Han Chinese population. The SNP rs13204 of the PFN1 gene may have an important function in ALS development. The phenotype of ALS patients with mutantPFN1 gene varies among different genetic backgrounds.",

Patients with SLE and healthy individuals were examined for -6415 CTCTAA/GC (rs17860508) and +1188A/C (rs3212227) in IL-12B and -924A/G (rs153109) and 4730T/C (rs181206) in IL-27 gene polymorphisms using the high-resolution melting method, PCR-RFLP method and TaqMan SNP genotyping assay, respectively. An increased frequency of GC/GC genotype as well as GC allele of the IL-12B rs17860508 was found in patients with SLE, as compared with healthy subjects (P < 0.001). We did not find differences in genotype and allele frequencies of the IL-12B rs3212227 and IL-27 rs153109 and rs181206 variants between patients with SLE and controls. IL-27 haplotype rs181206C/rs153109G indicated higher risk for SLE (P = 0.002), whereas haplotype rs181206T/rs153109G indicated reduced risk for SLE (P = 0.005). The IL-12B rs3212227 A/C polymorphism was associated with the mean value of the platelets (PLT), urea and complement C3 level. Furthermore, IL-12B rs17860508 genetic variant showed correlation with PLT, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio and alkaline phosphatase. Our results revealed that IL-12B rs17860508 and IL-27 haplotype CG are genetic risk factors for SLE and that both IL-12B rs17860508 and rs3212227 predict disease phenotype.",

Because of historically high rates of drug-associated adverse events, warfarin remains underprescribed. Further, interindividual variability in therapeutic dose mandates frequent monitoring until target anticoagulation is achieved. Genetic polymorphisms involved in warfarin metabolism and sensitivity have been implicated in variability of dose. Here, we describe a novel variant that influences warfarin requirements. To identify additional genetic variants that contribute to warfarin requirements, screening of DNA variants in additional genes that code for drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transport proteins was undertaken using the Affymetrix drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters panel. A DNA variant (rs2108622; V433M) in cytochrome P450 4F2 (CYP4F2) was associated with warfarin dose in 3 independent white cohorts of patients stabilized on warfarin representing diverse geographic regions in the United States and accounted for a difference in warfarin dose of approximately 1 mg/day between CC and TT subjects. Genetic variation of CYP4F2 was associated with a clinically relevant effect on warfarin requirement.",

Inspired by the role of Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in inactivating dopamine in the brain, we investigated to what extent COMT could modulate individual's self-consciousness dispositions and self-consistency by genotyping the COMT Val158Met (rs4680) polymorphism and measuring self-consciousness and self-consistency and congruence in a college student population. The results indicated that COMT Val158Met polymorphism significantly modulated the private self-consciousness. The individuals with Val/Val genotype, corresponding to lower dopamine levels in the brain, were more likely to be aware of their feelings and beliefs. The results also indicated that this polymorphism modulated one's self-flexibility. The individuals with Val/Val genotype showed higher levels of stereotype in self-concept compared with those with Met/Met genotype. These findings suggest that COMT is a predictor of the individual differences in self-consciousness and self-flexibility.",

The aim of this research was to determine whether the INF-\u03b3 +874 T/A polymorphism is associated with B1D susceptibility in an ethnic Iranian population.\n<b>Methods</b>: The IFN-\u03b3 +874 T/A (rs2430561) gene polymorphism was studied in 106 B1D patients and 109 control subjects using sequence specific primers (SSPs) and amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR).\n<b>Results</b>: Significant statistical differences in IFN-\u03b3 +874 T/A polymorphism genotype distribution were found between the patients and control subjects (P = 0.0006). Decreased risk of B1D was detected in the codominant model (T/T vs T/A and A/A, OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.07-0.49 for T/A, OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.12-1.24 for A/A, P value=0.0006), and in the dominant model (T/T vs T/A-A/A, OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.08-0.54, P = 0.0005).

This study investigated the relationship of ADIPOQ and IL6 gene polymorphisms with pro-inflammatory and cardiometabolic markers in obese patients.\n<b>Methods</b>: Anthropometric and body composition parameters were measured in 249 Brazilian subjects (30 to 68 yr). Metabolic and inflammatory markers and adipokines were analyzed in blood samples. ADIPOQ rs2241766 (45 T > G) and IL6 rs1800795 (-174G > C) polymorphisms were analyzed by real-time PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively.\n<b>Results</b>: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and increased values of waist circumference, body fat, leptin, fibrinogen, IL-1\u03b2, hsCRP and TNF\u03b1 were related to obesity (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed a positive correlation between BMI and waist circumference, body fat, leptin, fibrinogen, PAI-1, IL-1\u03b2, hsCRP and TNF\u03b1 values (p < 0.001) but not with adiponectin. Obese group had altered metabolic status, resistance to leptin and insulin, and atherogenic and pro-inflammatory profiles. ADIPOQ and IL6 variants were not directely related to obesity, leptin resistance or alterations in cardiometabolic markers. Individuals carrying ADIPOQ 45G allele (TG + GG genotype) had higher IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 levels than TT genotype carriers (p < 0.05). IL6 -174GG genotype was associated with increased IL-1\u03b2 levels (p = 0.033).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Obesity is associated with leptin resistance, cardiometabolic alterations and a pro-inflammatory status. Our results are suggestive that ADIPOQ and IL6 polymorphisms contribute to cardiometabolic risk in obese individuals.",

                "text": "Lumbar-disc herniation (LDH), one of the most common musculoskeletal diseases, has strong genetic determinants. Recently, several genes that encode extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the intervertebral disc have been reported to associate with LDH. Thrombospondins (THBSs) 1 and 2 are good candidates for the LDH susceptibility gene: They are intervertebral disc ECM proteins that regulate the effective levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9, which are key effectors of ECM remodeling. Here, we report that THBS2 is associated with LDH in Japanese populations. An intronic SNP in THBS2 (IVS10-8C --> T; rs9406328) showed significant association (p = 0.0000028) with LDH in two independent Japanese populations. This SNP, located in a polypyrimidine tract upstream of the 3' splice site of intron 10, exerts allelic differences on exon 11 skipping rates in vivo, with the susceptibility allele showing increased skipping. Skipping of exon 11 results in decreased THBS2 interaction with MMP2 and MMP9. Further, a missense SNP in MMP9 (Q279R; rs17576) is also strongly associated with LDH in the Japanese population (p = 0.00049) and shows a combinatorial effect with THBS2 (odds ratio 3.03, 95% confidence interval 1.58-5.77). Thus, a splicing-affecting SNP in THBS2 and a missense SNP in MMP9 are associated with susceptibility to LDH. Our data indicate that regulation of intervertebral disc ECM metabolism by the THBS2-MMP system plays an essential role in the etiology and pathogenesis of LDH.",

However, previous researches about the relationship between the +405G>C (dbSNP: rs2010963) polymorphism in VEGF gene and the risk of IMIDs are controversial and inconsistent. So we conducted this meta-analysis to assess whether the relationship between the +405G>C polymorphism in the 5'-UTR region of VEGF gene and IMID susceptibility exists. Methods Our literature search was conducted on the PubMed, Embase, Web of science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedical databases to retrieve for eligible studies. Odds ratios as well as their 95 % confidence intervals were utilized to deduce the possible relationship. Results A total number of 5175 patients with IMIDs and 7069 healthy controls from 27 case-control studies were included. For the overall eligible data collected in our meta-analysis, there was no marked relationship between +405G>C polymorphism and the risk of IMIDs. However, subgroup analysis by ethnicity suggested that +405C allele could be a protective factor for IMIDs in Asians, whereas an opposite conclusion was drawn in Caucasians. Conclusion Thus, we may come to the conclusion that the VEGF +405G>C polymorphism could be associated with IMIDs, and the correlation might vary with ethnic groups.",

Chemoresistance develops in nearly all patients with colorectal cancer, leading to a decrease in the therapeutic efficacies of anticancer agents. However, the effect of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission on chemoresistance in colorectal cancer is unclear. Here, we found that the release of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) in conditioned medium from dying cells by chemotherapeutic drugs and resistant cells, which triggered Drp1 phosphorylation via its receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE). RAGE signals ERK1/2 activation to phosphorylate Drp1 at residue S616 triggerring autophagy for chemoresistance and regrowth in the surviving cancer cells. Abolishment of Drp1 phosphorylation by HMGB1 inhibitor and RAGE blocker significantly enhance sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic treatment by suppressing autophagy. Furthermore, patients with high phospho-Drp1<sup>Ser616</sup> are associated with high risk on developing tumor relapse, poor 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neoCRT) treatment in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Moreover, patients with RAGE-G82S polymorphism (rs2070600) are associated with high phospho-Drp1<sup>Ser616</sup> within tumor microenvironment. These findings suggest that the release of HMGB1 from dying cancer cells enhances chemoresistance and regrowth via RAGE-mediated ERK/Drp1 phosphorylation.",

Some study suggested that alterations in CD36 gene may be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. The aim of the current study was to compare the frequency of CD36 variants in region encoding lipid-binding domain in Caucasian patients with early-onset CAD, no-CAD adult controls and neonates. The study group comprised 100 patients with early onset CAD. The genetic control groups were 306 infants and 40 no-CAD adults aged over 70years. Exons 4, 5 and 6 including fragments of flanking introns were studied using the denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography technique and direct sequencing. Changes detected in analyzed fragment of CD36: IVS3-6 T/C (rs3173798), IVS4-10 G/A (rs3211892), C311T (Thr104Ile, not described so far) in exon 5, G550A (Asp184Asn, rs138897347), C572T (Pro191Leu, rs143150225), G573A (Pro191Pro, rs5956) and A591T (Thr197Thr, rs141680676) in exon 6. No significant differences in the CD36 genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies were found between the three groups. Only borderline differences (p=0.066) were found between early onset CAD patients and newborns in the frequencies of 591T allele (2.00% vs 0.50%) and CGCGCGT haplotype (2.00% vs 0.50%) with both IVS3-6C and 591T variant alleles. In conclusion, CD36 variants: rs3173798, rs3211892, rs138897347, rs5956, rs143150225 rs141680676 and C311T do not seem to be involved in the risk of early-onset CAD in Caucasian population.",

                "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex polygenic inflammatory disease associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, which is the main cause of increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in RA patients. CARD8 is a constituent of inflammasome, which regulates interleukin 1-beta production, and has been associated with a worse disease course in early RA. One thousand six hundred twenty-one patients fulfilling the 1987 ACR classification criteria for RA and 1300 matched controls, were genotyped for the CARD8 rs2043211 (30T>A, p.C10X) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using predesigned TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. The genotyping success rate in our study was greater than 94%. We assessed CARD8 rs2043211 gene polymorphism results in 1530 Spanish RA patients in whom information on CV disease and CV risk factors was available at the time of the study. Also, a subgroup of patients with no history of CV events (n=276) was assessed for the potential influence of the rs2043211 variant in the development of subclinical atherosclerosis, by measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and presence of carotid plaques. No statistically significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies for the rs2043211 CARD8 gene variant between patients with RA and controls were seen. Similarly, CARD8 rs2043211 (30T>A, p.C10X) SNP did not influence the development of CV events or the risk of CV events throughout the time. Likewise, no significant association between this gene variant and carotid IMT or the presence of plaques was found. In summary, our results do not support a role of the CARD8 rs2043211 gene variant in susceptibility to RA or in the development of CV disease in patients with RA.",

We therefore performed a meta-analysis to investigate association of ACE G2350A polymorphism with hypertension.\n<b>Methods</b>: Published case-control studies in English were identified. A total of four studies with 1699 cases and 1274 controls were identified. A random-effects model was performed irrespective of the between-study heterogeneity. Study quality was assessed in duplicate.\n<b>Results</b>: Compared with 2350G, the ACE 2350A allele conferred a protective effect on hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-1.18; p = .28). Similarly, comparisons of 2350AA and 2350GA with 2350GG generated a nonsignificant reduced risk, respectively. Under the dominant model, the ACE 2350A allele conferred a reduced hypertension risk and such associations were divergent between Han Chinese and Muslims from the Arab Gulf and Pakistan. Under the recessive model, this protective effect was totally reversed (OR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.77-1.33; p = .94). Subgroup analyses indicated a significant protective effect of ACE 2350A compared with 2350G among Muslims from the Arab Gulf and Pakistan (OR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.42-0.71; p < .00001). No publication biases were observed.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our results demonstrate that the ACE 2350A allele is associated with a significantly reduced hypertension risk among Muslims from the Arab Gulf and Pakistan, yet an elevated risk among Han Chinese.",

The secreted NS1 protein of dengue virus activates macrophages and human PBMCs via TLR4 and induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which is responsible for the pathogenesis of disease. Mutations in TLR4 gene have been associated with the increased susceptibility to many viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases.\n<b>Objective</b>: To study the impact of TLR4 Asp299Gly (rs4986790) and Thr399Ile (rs4986791) gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to dengue infection.\n<b>Methods</b>: A total of 120 dengue infected (57; DHF/DSS and 63; DF) and 200 healthy controls were included in the study. TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile gene polymorphisms was studied by PCR-RFLP. Expression of TLR4 mRNA was evaluated by rRT-PCR.\n<b>Results</b>: Individuals with heterozygous genotype for TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms had increased susceptibility to dengue infection (OR-1.70, 95% CI=1.01-2.86 P=0.042 and OR-2.17, 95% CI=1.10-4.28, P=0.024, respectively). The frequency of Gly and Ile alleles were higher in dengue patients as compared to controls (OR-1.67, 95% CI=1.05-2.64, P=0.029 and OR-2.20, 95% CI=1.19-4.07, P=0.011, respectively). IIe/Gly haplotype was associated with the risk of the disease when compared with controls (OR=3.15, 95% CI=1.09-9.09, P=0.035). The mRNA expression was higher in DF when compared with DHF/DSS and controls (P=0.040 and 0.009, respectively).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: A higher expression of TLR4 mRNA was associated with DF. The TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile gene polymorphisms were associated with the susceptibility of dengue infection probably by altering the immune response.",

XRCC1 is reported to be a candidate influence on cancer risk. The aim of our present study was to assess the association of rs1799782 (Arg194Trp) and rs25487 (Arg399Gln) XRCC1 gene polymorphisms with breast cancer in the Saudi population.\n<b>Materials And Methods</b>: The two SNP's were analyzed in breast cancer patients and healthy control subjects. Genotypes were determined by TaqMan SNP genotype analysis technique and data were analyzed using Chi- square or t test and logistic regression analysis by SPSS16.0 software.\n<b>Results And Conclusions</b>: Results showed that rs1799782 significantly increased susceptibility to breast cancer with Arg/Trp, Arg/Trp+Trp/Trp genotypes and at Trp allele overall study. It also increased risk of breast cancer in older age patients (above 48) and with the ER positive category. XRCC1rs25487 (Arg399Gln) did not showed any significant association. In conclusion the XRCC1rs1799782 polymorphism may be involved in the etiology of breast cancer in the Saudi population. Confirmation of our findings in larger populations of different ethnicities is warranted.",

Although the pathogenesis of MS remains unknown, it is widely regarded as an autoimmune disease mediated by T-lymphocytes directed against myelin proteins and/or other oligodendrocyte epitopes.\n<b>Methods</b>: In this study we investigated the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood cells from patients with RRMS during the relapse and the remission phases utilizing gene microarray technology. Dysregulated genes encoded in regions associated with MS susceptibility from genomic screens or previous transcriptomic studies were identified. The proximal promoter region polymorphisms of two genes were tested for association with disease and expression level.\n<b>Results</b>: Distinct sets of dysregulated genes during the relapse and remission phases were identified including genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation. Three of these dysregulated genes have been previously implicated with MS susceptibility in genomic screens: TGFbeta1, CD58 and DBC1. TGFbeta1 has one common SNP in the proximal promoter: -508 T>C (rs1800469). Genotyping two Australian trio sets (total 620 families) found a trend for over-transmission of the T allele in MS in females (p < 0.13). Upregulation of CD58 and DBC1 in remission is consistent with their putative roles in promoting regulatory T cells and reducing cell proliferation, respectively. A fourth gene, ALOX5, is consistently found over-expressed in MS. Two common genetic variants were confirmed in the ALOX5 putative promoter: -557 T>C (rs12762303) and a 6 bp tandem repeat polymorphism (GGGCGG) between position -147 and -176; but no evidence for transmission distortion found.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: The dysregulation of these genes tags their metabolic pathways for further investigation for potential therapeutic intervention.",

We aimed to thoroughly investigate the DNA sequence variations of whole COX-2 exons in a large case-control study of pancreatic cancer by direct sequencing. METHODS The entire exonic regions of COX-2 including 10 exons were sequenced in the germline DNA of 96 patients with pancreatic cancer. Selected variants within exons six to seven (E6E7) amplicon from the test panel were genotyped in 96 controls. RESULTS The COX-2 gene was demonstrated to be genetically conserved. Four missense mutations were found in three cases. However the common variant c.724-10_724-7delATTT (rs201231411) that is located in intron 6, showed significant difference between cases and controls (21 [21.9%] vs 11 [%11.5], p=0.05). CONCLUSION This study determined that COX-2 has a conservative sequence, which is required for its enzymatic activity and supports the important role of this enzyme's expression in pancreatic cancer rather than any changes in its activity. The effect of intronic variant rs201231411 on COX-2 expression could be analyzed in future studies.",

                "text": "Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a multifactorial pregnancy-specific vascular disorder characterized by hypertension and proteinuria and affects around 3-8% of pregnancies worldwide. Defective placentation during the early stage of pregnancy most likely in combination with maternal and environmental factors could lead to systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and the manifestation of the clinical symptoms. Inadequate number of regulatory T cells (Tregs) or their functional deficiency is linked with infertility, miscarriage and PE. It is well identified that forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) gene is a master control gene for the development and function of Tregs that play an important role in the maintenance of self-tolerance and mediate maternal tolerance to the foetus. The main objective of this study was to assess the maternal susceptibility to PE with respect to a deletion mutation in exon-2 and -3279 C > A polymorphism (rs3761548) in the promoter region within the Foxp3 gene in a total of 282 PE patients and 215 normal pregnant women. The results showed that exon-2 deletion mutation is present in 1.06% of patients and none in the controls, indicating that it was not a common gene polymorphism associated with PE. With respect to rs3761548, the C allele frequency was observed to be higher in patients than in controls (49% versus 27%; OR = 2.81, P < 0.01). In conclusion, our results are suggestive of A allele to be protective against PE and C allele as predisposing in a dose-dependent manner in our population.",

For the association study, we selected three polymorphisms: -782A>G (rs2968915), intervening sequence (IVS)5+169C>T (rs5918007) and +1513A>G (rs6609080). In women, the prevalence of lacunar infarction and LVH was significantly higher in subjects with the +1513GG genotype than in those with the AA or AG genotypes (lacunar infarction: P=0.01, LVH: P=0.003). Plasma renin activity (PRA) levels in women with the GG genotype were significantly lower than in women with the AA or AG genotypes (P=0.01). Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for confounding factors demonstrated that +1513A>G polymorphism was significantly and independently associated with the risk of lacunar infarction (trend P=0.03) and LVH (trend P=0.003). In men, there were no significant differences in lacunar infarction, LVH or PRA levels among the three genotypes. The polymorphism of the (P)RR gene +1513A>G is associated with lacunar infarction and LVH in Japanese women. These results suggest that (P)RR has a role in organ damage in humans.",

We aimed to investigate AMD risk factors by evaluating multiple factors in association with large drusen, an important component of AMD, simultaneously. In a community-based cross-sectional survey in Japan, 971 large drusen cases and 3,209 controls were compared for 65 variables, including systemic, environmental, and genetic factors. The association and the effect size of each factor were evaluated with logistic regression analysis using a backward-elimination approach. Multivariate analyses identified a significant association in serum calcium level (odds ratio [OR] = 0.932, P = 1.05 \u00d7 10(-3)), ARMS2 A69S (rs10490924) genotype (OR = 1.046, P < 0.001), Chlamydia pneumoniae IgG (OR = 1.020, P = 0.0440), and age (OR = 1.013, P < 0.001) for large drusen. Hypocalcemia was observed in 7.2% of large drusen cases and in 5.5% of controls (P = 0.0490). C. pneumoniae infections was more frequent in large drusen cases (56.4%) than in controls (51.7%, P = 0.00956). These results suggest that calcium, ARMS2 genotype, C. pneumonia infection, and age are significant factors in the development of the early stages of AMD.",

Therefore, we studied the association of the TLR9 -1486 T/C (rs187084) and C2848T (rs352140) polymorphisms with cervical cancer. The TLR9 -1486 T/C and C2848T polymorphism was genotyped in 426 patients and 460 unrelated healthy females from the Polish population. Logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, tobacco smoking, and menopausal status showed that both the TLR9 -1486 T/C and C2848T polymorphisms could be a genetic risk factor for cervical cancer. For the TLR9 -1486 T/C polymorphism, the adjusted OR for patients with the C/T genotype versus T/T genotype was 1.371 (95 % CI 1.021-1.842, p = 0.0361), the adjusted OR for the C/C genotype vs the T/T genotype was 1.300 (95 % CI 1.016-1.507, p = 0.0096), and the adjusted OR for the C/T or C/C genotype vs the T/T genotype was 1.448 (95 % CI 1.099-1.908, p = 0.0083). For the C2848T polymorphism, the adjusted OR for patients with the C/T genotype vs C/C genotype was 1.443 (95 % CI 1.019-2.043, p = 0.0380), the adjusted OR for the T/T genotype vs the C/C genotype was 1.237 (95 % CI 1.016-1.507, p = 0.0328), and the adjusted OR for the T/C or T/T genotype vs the C/C genotype was 1.345 (95 % CI 0.976-1.855, p = 0.0700).

The 1298A>C polymorphism (rs1801131) leads to mildly decreased MTHFR activity. Previously, it was observed that the MTHFR 1298A>C polymorphism in combined analysis with the MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism increases homocysteine levels. However, conflicting results on its relation to ischaemic stroke in children can be found. We conducted a meta-analysis to analyse possible connections between the MTHFR 1298A>C polymorphism and ischaemic stroke in paediatric patients. We identified available data published before December 2016 using appropriate keywords and searching PubMed as well as the references cited in the found articles. Eight case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis (426 children with stroke and 778 controls). Statistical analyses were made using R and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis softwares to investigate the impact of polymorphism in four models: dominant, recessive, additive and allelic. No publication bias was observed in the meta-analysis. We demonstrated no relationship between the 1298A>C polymorphism and ischaemic stroke in children in the case of recessive, additive and allelic models. However, the results of the dominant model analysis should be treated with caution due to the sensitivity analysis results. After omitting one of the included study, we observed a significant association between the carriers of the MTHFR C allele (cases with AC + CC genotypes) and ischaemic stroke in children (OR 1.35 95% CI 1.02-1.79, p = 0.035 in a fixed effects model). In conclusion, the 1298A>C polymorphism in the MTHFR gene is not a risk factor for ischaemic stroke in paediatric patients.",

The objective of the study was to examine the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-4 gene on aspirin hypersensitivity in asthmatics at the genetic and molecular levels.\n<b>Methods</b>: Aspirin-intolerant (AIA, n=103) and aspirin-tolerant asthmatics (n=270) were genotyped and functional promoter assays were performed.\n<b>Results</b>: Of 15 SNPs tested, seven (-589T>C (rs2243250) in promoter, -33T>C (rs2070874) in the 5'-untranslated region, +4047A>G (rs2243266), +4144C>G (rs2243267), +4221C>A (rs2243268), +4367G>A (rs2243270), and +5090A>G (rs2243274) in introns) were significantly associated with AIA risk. The frequency of the rare allele (C) of -589T>C was higher in the AIA group than in the aspirin-tolerant asthmatic group (P=0.016), and a gene dose-dependent decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s was noted after an aspirin challenge (P=0.0009). Aspirin unregulated IL-4 mRNA production in Jurkat T and K562 leukemia cells. A reporter plasmid assay revealed that aspirin augmented IL-4 promoter transactivation with the -589T>C C and -33T>C C alleles, compared with that bearing the -589T>C T and -33T>C T alleles. Further, electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed the formation of nuclear complexes with -33T>C and -589T>C allele-containing probes; this was augmented by aspirin. The complexes formed with the -33T>C and -589T>C probes were shifted by treatment with anti-CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins \u03b2 and anti-nuclear factor of activated T-cells antibodies, respectively, indicating the inclusion of these transcription factors.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Aspirin may regulate IL4 expression in an allele-specific manner by altering the availability of transcription factors to the key regulatory elements in the IL4 promoter, leading to aspirin hypersensitivity.",

In this study, patients with alcohol dependence and major depression (n=108) received open-label naltrexone and clinical case management for 12 weeks, and were randomized to citalopram or placebo. General linear mixed models examined the effect of the OPRM1 A118G genotype on alcohol outcomes during treatment. There was no evidence of any difference in the percentage of days abstinent, drinks per drinking day or percentage of heavy drinking days between Asp40 carriers and noncarriers during treatment. This study therefore failed to replicate the previous positive findings for this single nucleotide polymorphism in relation to naltrexone response, possibly indicating that the effect is not present in depressed patients.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) up-regulate the VEGF expression; thus, genetic polymorphisms in the VEGFA gene could affect the antihypertensive responses to these drugs.\n<b>Methods</b>: Hypertensive patients (n = 102) were prospectively treated only with the ACEi enalapril for 60 days. We compared the effect of VEGFA polymorphisms on changes in blood pressure after enalapril treatment. In addition, multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to assess the effect of covariates on blood pressure. Genotypes for g.-2578C>A (rs699947), g.-1154G>A (rs1570360), and g.-634G>C (rs2010963) VEGFA polymorphisms were determined, and haplotype frequencies were estimated.\n<b>Results</b>: Individuals carrying the CA and AA genotypes for the g.-2578C>A polymorphism and the AGG haplotype showed more intense decrease in blood pressure in response to enalapril 20 mg/day. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the AA genotype for the g.-2578C>A polymorphism and the AGG haplotype are associated with more intense decrease in blood pressure in response to enalapril 20 mg/day, while the CC genotype for the g.-2578C>A polymorphism and the CGG haplotype are associated with the opposite effect.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: These findings suggest that polymorphisms in VEGFA gene may affect the antihypertensive responses to enalapril.",

The lack in prediction accuracy has been a major hurdle in relying on the computational results obtained by implementing multiple tools, platforms and algorithms for cancer associated SNP prediction. Our result obtained from the initial computational compilations suggests the strong chance of Aurora-A G325W mutation (rs11539196) to cause hepatocellular carcinoma. The implementation of molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) approaches has significantly aided in raising the prediction accuracy of these results, but measuring the difference in the convergence time of mutant protein structures has been a challenging task while setting the simulation timescale. The convergence time of most of the protein structures may vary from 10 ns to 100 ns or more, depending upon its size. Thus, in this work we have implemented 200 ns of MDS to aid the final results obtained from computational SNP prediction technique. The MDS results have significantly explained the atomic alteration related with the mutant protein and are useful in elaborating the change in structural conformations coupled with the computationally predicted cancer associated mutation. With further advancements in the computational techniques, it will become much easier to predict such mutations with higher accuracy level.",

In this study, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the melatonin receptor genes (MTNR1A and MTNR1B) were associated with schizophrenia and with sleep problems such as insomnia and hypersomnia in schizophrenia patients. We genotyped two promoter SNPs [rs2119882 (-184T/C) of MTNR1A and rs4753426 (-1193C/T) of MTNR1B] using direct sequencing in 289 schizophrenia patients and 505 control subjects. We found that rs2119882 of MTNR1A was associated with schizophrenia in recessive model [CC vs. TT/TC, p = 0.013, odds ratio (OR) = 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12-2.55]. Interestingly, in an analysis of clinical phenotypes, we found that rs2119882 of MTNR1A was also associated with insomnia symptoms of schizophrenia (recessive model, p = 0.010, OR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.21-4.14), but not with hypersomnia symptoms as determined using the Operational Criteria checklist. However, rs4753426 of MTNR1B was not associated with either schizophrenia or clinical phenotypes. Our results suggest that MTNR1A may be a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia and may be associated with insomnia symptoms exhibited in schizophrenia patients.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the spectrum of RET variants in France between 2003 and 2013, and to evaluate the impact of SNPs on the MEN2 A phenotype.\n<b>Methods</b>: In this retrospective cohort study, RET variants were screened in 5109 index cases, and RET pathogenic variants were screened in 2214 relatives. Exons 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 were characterized by Sanger sequencing. RET pathogenic variants, RET variants with unknown functional significance (VUS), and four RET SNP variants-G691S (rs1799939), L769L (rs1800861), S836S (rs1800862), and S904S (rs1800863)-were characterized and are reported in index cases. In silico analysis and classification following the recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics was performed for RET VUS. Each patient's age at the time of diagnosis, sex, and the endocrine neoplasias present at molecular diagnosis were recorded.\n<b>Results</b>: Twenty-six single VUS in RET without any well-defined risk profiles were found in 33 patients. Nine of these were considered probably pathogenic, 11 of uncertain significance, and six as probably benign. Three double pathogenic variants found in three patients were classified as pathogenic. A study of the entire cohort showed that patients carrying pathogenic variants or VUS in RET together with PHEO were diagnosed earlier than the others. The presence of the G691S SNP, or a combination of SNPs, increased the risk of developing PHEO but did not modify the date of the diagnosis. No association was found between SNPs and medullary thyroid cancer or hyperparathyroidism.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The findings propose a classification of 15 of the 26 VUS in RET without any well-defined risk profiles and suggest that the G691S SNP, or a combination of SNPs, may be associated with the development of PHEO.",

                "text": "Mismatch repair (MMR) plays an important role in repairing nucleotide mismatches during DNA replication. Defects in MMR genes are associated with some sporadic tumors. MLH1 and MSH2 are two of the MMR genes. We conducted a case-control study to investigate the associations between the risk of lung cancer and genetic polymorphisms in the MLH1 and MSH2 genes. The SNP genotypes were determined in 730 lung cancer patients and 730 healthy controls that were frequency matched for the age, gender, and smoking status. Among the SNP polymorphisms, -93A>G (rs1800734), which is located in the promoter region of MLH1, was significantly associated with the risk of lung cancer. The GG genotype for MLH1 -93A>G was associated with a significantly increased risk of lung cancer compared with the AA genotype among the never-smoking group (adjusted OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.10-2.44; P=0.013). Consistently, the haplotype of MLH1 with one -93G risk allele was associated with the risk of lung cancer compared with the AA haplotype among the never-smoking group. Furthermore, the risk of MLH1 -93A>G polymorphism in the never-smoking group related to lung adenocarcinoma was modulated by environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure status, with a significant gene-ETS interaction (P=0.042). No evidence was found of the association between MSH2 and the lung cancer risk. In conclusion, our data suggest that the MLH1 -93A>G polymorphism may contribute to the etiology of lung cancer, particularly in never smokers. This study also suggests that MLH1 -93A>G polymorphisms and ETS exposure have a role in the tumorigenesis of lung adenocarcinoma among never smokers.",

Furthermore, no previous study has compared the angiogenic potency of hKLK1, with its loss of function polymorphic variant, rs5515 (R53H), which possesses reduced kinin-forming activity.\n<b>Methods And Results</b>: Here, we demonstrate that tissue kallikrein knockout mice (KLK1-/-) show impaired muscle neovascularization in response to hindlimb ischemia. Gene-transfer of wild-type Ad.hKLK1 but not Ad.R53H-hKLK1 was able to rescue this defect. Similarly, in the rat mesenteric assay, Ad.hKLK1 induced a mature neovasculature with increased vessel diameter through kinin-B2 receptor-mediated recruitment of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas Ad.R53H-hKLK1 was ineffective. Moreover, hKLK1 but not R53H-hKLK1 overexpression in the zebrafish induced endothelial precursor cell migration and vascular remodeling. Furthermore, Ad.hKLK1 activates metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in normoperfused muscle and fails to promote reparative neovascularization in ischemic MMP9-/- mice, whereas its proarteriogenic action was preserved in ApoE-/- mice, an atherosclerotic model of impaired angiogenesis.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: These results demonstrate the fundamental role of endogenous Tissue Kallikrein in vascular repair and provide novel information on the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the robust arterialization induced by hKLK1 overexpression.",

The assessment of these SNPs on survival impact from two melanoma patient cohorts (Barcelona, N = 493 and Essen, N = 215) reveals that p.Ala471 correlates with a better outcome (OR= 0.57, 95% CI = 0.33-0.99, Adj. p = 0.043, in Barcelona OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.40-1.01, Adj. p = 0.051, in Essen). While, p.Leu224 was associated with increased melanoma-associated mortality in both cohorts (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.07-3.24, Adj. p = 0.030 in Barcelona and OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.04-3.26, Adj. p = 0.037, in Essen). Furthermore survival analyses showed that the Pro224-Ala471 haplotype in homozygosis improved melanoma survival in the entire set of patients (HR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.67, Adj. p = 0.005). These findings highlight the relevance of genetic variability in immune-related genes for clinical outcome in melanoma.",

We genotyped IL-6 -174 G>C and -572 C>G in 402 patients with CAD and 402 control individuals. IL-6 -174 G>C (rs1800795) and -572 C>G (rs1800796) alleles were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Patients with CAD were more likely to have a smoking habit, diabetes, and hypertension, a high level of triglycerides, and low levels of total cholesterol and high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Multivariate regression analyses showed that subjects carrying the IL-6 -174CC genotype had a small but significant increased risk of CAD (P = 0.004). Those carrying the IL-6 -174 G>C polymorphic variant had a slightly increased risk of CAD in both dominant and recessive models. However, we did not find significant association between the IL-6 -572 C>G polymorphism and risk of CAD. Moreover, a significant interaction was found between the IL-6 -174 G>C polymorphism, gender, and smoking habit. Our study, therefore, demonstrated that the IL-6 -174 G>C polymorphism is correlated with CAD risk, and that this polymorphism shows interactions with both gender and smoking.",

Deficiency or deactivation of these proteins as a result of gene alterations has been indicated in several cancers. Such genetic variations could be considered as susceptibility indicators in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Therefore, we investigated the associations between ALL risk and <i>TP53</i> codon 72, <i>p21</i> codon 31, and <i>MDM2</i> SNP309 polymorphisms in an Iranian population.\n<b>Methods</b>: Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to determine the <i>MDM2</i> T309G (rs2279744), <i>TP53</i> codon Arg72Pro (rs1042522), and <i>p21</i> Ser31Arg (rs1801270) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This study was performed in 115 ALL patients and 115 healthy controls in Khuzestan province in southwest Iran.\n<b>Results</b>: In the control group and ALL patients, <i>p21</i> Ser/Arg, and <i>MDM2</i> TG and GG genotypes were associated with significant 1.81-fold (95% confidence interval CI= 1.008-3.267; P < 0.05), 11.07-fold (95% CI= 5.10-24.05; P < 0.0001), and 19.41-fold (95% CI= 8.56-43.99; P < 0.0001) increased risks for ALL, respectively. The <i>TP53</i> 72 Arg allele was significantly more prevalent in ALL patients (56.96%) than in control subjects (47.39%), and was significantly associated with ALL (OR= 1.47; 95% CI = 1.017-2.121, P < 0.05).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: The <i>MDM2</i>T309G and the <i>p21</i> Ser31Arg SNPs indicate a significantly increased risk for developing ALL in Khuzestan province.",

The role of CLRs in Behcet's disease (BD) is unknown and thus was the purpose of this study. A two-stage association study was carried out and a total of 766 BD patients and 1674 healthy controls were recruited. Genotyping of 14 SNPs of 13 genes in CLRs was carried out by iPLEX Gold genotyping or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. The expression of mannose binding lectin 2 (MBL2) and killer cell lectin like receptor C4 (KLRC4) was measured by Real-time PCR. Significantly increased frequencies of the A allele as well as AA genotype of rs1800450 in MBL2 (Pc = 2.50 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup>, OR = 1.494; Pc = 2.24 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup>,OR = 2.899; respectively) and TT genotype of rs2617170 in KLRC4 (Pc = 2.53 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup>, OR = 1.695) and decreased frequencies of GG genotype of rs1800450 (Pc = 1.56 \u00d7 10-3, OR = 0.689) and C allele as well as CC genotype of rs2617170 (Pc = 2.05 \u00d7 10-9,OR = 0.664; Pc = 1.20 \u00d7 10-5, OR = 0.585; respectively) were observed in BD. Two variants, p.Gly54Asp (rs1800450) and p.Asn104Ser (rs2617170) affect MBL2 and KLRC4 protein stability and expression. Our study demonstrates that the MBL2/rs1800450 and KLRC4/rs2617170 are susceptibility factors for BD in a Chinese Han population.",

E-cadherin (CDH1) is involved in epithelial cell-cell interactions and plays important roles in the etiology of nephrolithiasis. We hypothesized that variants in the CDH1 gene are associated with risk of nephrolithiasis. In a hospital-based case-control study of 127 nephrolithiasis patients and 152 controls frequency matched by age and sex, we genotyped the functional -160C>A (rs16260) polymorphism and assessed its associations with risk of nephrolithiasis in a Chinese population. We found that the CA/AA genotypes were associated with a significantly decreased risk of nephrolithiasis (OR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.32-0.87), compared with the CC genotype, particularly among subgroups of BMI > 24 kg/m(2) (OR = 0.38, 95%CI = 0.17-0.85), age \u2264 57 years (OR = 0.47, 95%CI = 0.24-0.93), and men (OR = 0.56, 95%CI = 0.29-0.99).

                "text": "<b>Background & Objectives</b>: Simultaneous administration of phenytoin and isoniazid (INH) in tuberculous meningitis (TBM) or tuberculoma patients with seizures results in higher plasma phenytoin level and thus phenytoin intoxication. N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) enzyme catalyses two acetylation reactions in INH metabolism and NAT2 gene polymorphism leads to slow and rapid acetylators. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of allelic variants of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene as a predisposing factor for phenytoin toxicity in patients with TBM or tuberculoma having seizures, and taking INH and phenytoin simultaneously.\n<b>Methods</b>: Sixty patients with TBM or tuberculoma with seizures and taking INH and phenytoin simultaneously for a minimum period of seven days were included in study. Plasma phenytoin was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. NAT2 gene polymorphism was studied using restriction fragment length polymorphism and allele specific PCR.\n<b>Results</b>: The patients were grouped into those having phenytoin intoxication and those with normal phenytoin level, and also classified as rapid or slow acetylators by NAT2 genotyping. Genotypic analysis showed that of the seven SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) of NAT2 gene studied, six mutations were found to be associated with phenytoin intoxication. For rs1041983 (C282T), rs1799929 (C481T), rs1799931 (G857A), rs1799930 (G590A), rs1208 (A803G) and rs1801280 (T341C) allelic variants, the proportion of homozygous mutant was higher in phenytoin intoxicated group than in phenytoin non-intoxicated group.\n<b>Interpretation & Conclusions</b>: Homozygous mutant allele of NAT2 gene at 481site may act as a predisposing factor for phenytoin intoxication among TBM or tuberculoma patients having seizures.",

                "text": "Three linkage studies of bipolar disorder have implicated chromosome 12q24.3 with lod scores of over 3.0 and several other linkage studies have found lods between 2 and 3. Fine mapping within the original chromosomal linkage regions has identified several loci that show association with bipolar disorder. One of these is the P2RX7 gene encoding a central nervous system-expressed purinergic receptor. A non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2230912 (P2RX7-E13A, G allele) and a microsatellite marker NBG6 were both previously found to be associated with bipolar disorder (P=0.00071 and 0.008, respectively). rs2230912 has also been found to show association with unipolar depression. The effect of the polymorphism is non-conservative and results in a glutamine to arginine change (Gln460Arg), which is likely to affect P2RX7 dimerization and protein-protein interactions. We have confirmed the allelic associations between bipolar disorder and the markers rs2230912 (P2RX7-E13A, G allele, P=0.043) and NBG6 (P=0.010) in a London-based sample of 604 bipolar cases and 560 controls. When we combined these data with the published case-control studies of P2RX7 and mood disorder (3586 individuals) the association between rs2230912 (Gln460Arg) and affective disorders became more robust (P=0.002). The increase in Gln460Arg was confined to heterozygotes rather than homozygotes suggesting a dominant effect (odds ratio 1.302, CI=1.129-1.503). Although further research is needed to prove that the Gln460Arg change has an aetiological role, it is so far the most convincing mutation to have been found with a role for increasing susceptibility to bipolar and genetically related unipolar disorders.",

                "text": "Childbearing and use of oral contraceptives are known to lower the risk of ovarian cancer, and it has been suggested that progesterone or progestin exposures play a role in these associations. The effects of progesterone may be mediated in part through the progesterone receptor, which exists in two functionally distinct protein isoforms, hPR-A and hPR-B. It is known that individuals carrying the A allele of the progesterone receptor gene (PGR) polymorphism, +331 A/G (rs10895068), have greater production of the hPR-B receptor isoform. We therefore examined the association between PGR +331 A/G genotype and risk of ovarian cancer in a population-based study of 490 cases and 534 controls in the state of Connecticut. Adjusted for various reproductive and other factors, a statistically significant increased risk was seen for carriage of the A allele compared with GG genotype [odds ratio (OR), 1.68; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.09-2.59]. When subjects were considered separately according to menopausal status, no increased risk with the A allele was seen for premenopausal women (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-2.02) but significantly increased risk was found for postmenopausal women (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.31-4.06). Similar increased risks particularly among postmenopausal women were seen for all histologic tumor types. These findings have been observed before for breast and endometrial cancer, although not for ovary, but still suggest that an hPR-B mechanism may be involved in ovarian neoplasia.",

However, the exact role of CAV1 in childhood leukemia is still controversial. We investigated six novel polymorphic variants of CAV1, namely C521A (rs1997623), G14713A (rs3807987), G21985A (rs12672038), T28608A (rs3757733), T29107A (rs7804372), and G32124A (rs3807992), and analyzed the association of each specific genotype with susceptibility to childhood leukemia.\n<b>Materials And Methods</b>: In total, 266 patients with childhood leukemia and 266 age-matched healthy controls, recruited from two major medical centers in Taiwan, were genotyped investigating the association of these polymorphisms with childhood leukemia.\n<b>Results</b>: We found that there were significant differences between childhood leukemia and control groups in the distributions of their genotypes (p=4.1\u00d710(-8) and 0.0167) and allelic frequencies (p=4.9\u00d710(-10) and 3.7\u00d710(-3)) in the CAV1 G14713A and T29107A polymorphisms, respectively. As for the haplotype analysis, those who had GG/AT or GG/AA at CAV1 G14713A/T29107A had a reduced risk of childhood leukemia compared to those with GG/TT, while those with any other combinations were at increased risk.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: The A allele of CAV1 G14713A is risky, while the A allele of CAV1 T29107A is protective for the development of childhood leukemia and these may be novel useful genomic markers for the early detection of childhood leukemia.",

Similar associations were seen at the haplotype level in haplotype ACCCA where +1059 C-carriers had lower median CRP values than non-carriers (p=0.008). One CRP genotype (rs1130864) was associated with one CAE parameter in men but no association was observed between CRP genotypes and carotid artery IMT.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: CRP gene allelic variation is associated with CRP levels in both sexes and with one CAE parameter (SI) in men in a population-based Finnish cohort of middle-aged subjects.",

In a sample of 612 youth (girls = 432, M = 11.82 years, SD = 1.5) adopted from institutions (e.g., orphanages) in 25 countries, we examined whether the Val66Met polymorphism of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene moderates attention problems associated with the duration of institutional care. Parent-reported attention problem symptoms were collected using the MacArthur Health and Behavior Questionnaire. DNA was genotyped for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met (rs6265) single nucleotide polymorphism. Among youth from Southeast (SE) Asia, the predominant genotype was valine/methionine (Val/Met), whereas among youth from Russia/Europe and Caribbean/South America, the predominant genotype was Val/Val. For analysis, youth were grouped as carrying Val/Val or Met/Met alleles. Being female, being from SE Asia, and being younger when adopted were associated with fewer attention regulatory problem symptoms. Youth carrying at least one copy of the Met allele were more sensitive to the duration of deprivation, yielding an interaction that followed a differential susceptibility pattern. Thus, youth with Val/Met or Met/Met genotypes exhibited fewer symptoms than Val/Val genotypes when adoption was very early and more symptoms when adoption occurred later in development. Similar patterns were observed when SE Asian youth and youth from other parts of the world were analyzed separately.",

Polymorphisms in the DNA Methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) gene, one of the crucial gene of the folate metabolism, affects the activity of the enzyme and increases the susceptibility of nondisjunction in mothers of Down syndrome children (MDS).\n<b>Methods</b>: Considering this hypothesis we investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of the DNMT3B gene (rs1569686 -579G>T; rs2424913 -149C>T) with a predisposition of mothers to deliver a Down syndrome (DS) child. The study was performed on DNA samples from 150 MDS and 172 control mothers. Transmission disequilibrium tests were performed on 103 DS trio families. Genotyping was done using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.\n<b>Results</b>: With respect to the single nucleotide polymorphisms studied, no significant difference was observed in the genotypes and alleles frequency distributions between MDS and control mothers. The frequency of the DNMT3B-579G allele was, respectively, 0.34 in MDS and 0.33 in control mothers whereas the frequency of the DNMT3B-149C allele was respectively 0.31 in MDS and 0.26 in control mothers. No significant deviation in genotypic combinations as well as in transmission disequilibrium tests analysis was observed. However, a strong linkage disequilibrium was observed with significant differences in the distribution of G-T and G-C haplotypes among case and control mothers.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Although the above studied polymorphisms of DNMT3B may not be an independent risk factor it might be possible that certain allelic combinations (G-T) are. This finding suggests that DNMT3B might be a maternal risk factor for DS in our Indian cohort. Replication studies are required to confirm these findings.",

To get a more precise evaluation of the correlation between <i>ATG16L1</i> rs2241880 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility, we performed a meta-analysis of the association of all eligible studies. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> Searches were performed in the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases up to November 2018. A total of 12 case-control studies from 9 articles comprising 2254 cases and 4974 controls were included. Statistical analysis was achieved by STATA 14.1 and Review Manager 5.3 software. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) under five genetic models were used to determine the strength of association among rs2241880 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility. <i>Results:</i> The findings did not support an association between the rs2241880 variant in either the overall study population or the subgroups, based on cancer types and ethnicity in any of the genetic models. As far as we know, our study is the first meta-analysis of the association between rs2241880 polymorphism and cancer risk. <i>Conclusions:</i> In conclusion, the findings of this meta-analysis proposes that the <i>ATG16L1</i> rs2241880 polymorphism may not play a role in cancer development. Further well-designed studies are necessary to clarify the precise role of the <i>ATG16L1</i> rs2241880 polymorphism on cancer risk.",

Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) is an inhibitory adaptor protein within the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway, which recognizes structurally conserved molecular patterns of microbial pathogens, initiating immune responses. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of variants in the TOLLIP gene with susceptibility to leprosy in Mexican patients.\n<b>Methods</b>: TOLLIP polymorphisms were studied using a case-control design of Mexican patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL). The polymorphisms of TOLLIP at loci -526 C>G (rs5743854), 1309956C>T (rs3750920), 1298430C>A (rs5744015), and 1292831 G>A (rs3750919) were analyzed by PCR, with sequence-specific primers in LL patients and healthy subjects (HS) as controls.\n<b>Results</b>: Genotype distributions were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium for all sites except for rs3750920. Neither genotype nor allele frequencies were statistically different between LL patients and controls (P > 0.05). The maximum pairwise D' coefficient reached was 0.44 of linkage (P = 0.01) for all the polymorphisms except for rs5743854.

However, the European First Episode Schizophrenia Trial showed that hyperprolacti nemia occurred in a significant proportion of drug-na\u00efve first-episode schizophrenia patients, which shows that it may also be caused by other factors, including genetic predisposition. Therefore, we investigated the functional polymorphism of the prolactin gene in schizophrenic patients compared with control subjects.\n<b>Method</b>: The experimental group consisted of 403 patients with schizophrenia: 202 females and 201 males. The control group consisted of 653 subjects: 377 females and 276 males. The functional polymorphism -1149 G/T (rs1341239) of the prolactin gene was genotyped using the TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism allelic discrimination method.\n<b>Results</b>: The distribution of genotypes in schizophrenic patients was significantly different from those of the control subjects (p=0.031). After breaking down by gender, for male patients, the difference versus control males was significant for both genotypes and alleles (p=0.031 and p=0.002, respectively), with allele G being observed more frequently in schizophrenic patients.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: The results may suggest a possible abnormality of the functional -1149 G/T polymorphism of the prolactin gene in schizophrenia, especially in male patients, similar to that found in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.

A transmembrane (TM) alanine-encoding GCT repeats, termed A4, A5, A5.1, A6 and A9 in the MICA gene, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): the Met129Val polymorphism (rs1051792) and the nonsynonymously coding SNP (rs1051794) were genotyped in 142 patients with RA and 123 unrelated healthy individuals using, respectively, PCR fluorescent method, nested PCR-RFLP and allele specific PCR (ASP). Association was assessed based on the \u03c72 test, genotype relative risk (GRR) and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our results show a trend of association of the different MICA genotypes G/G, G/A and A/A (P = 0.029) which did not attain the significance after Bonferroni's correction (pc = 0.08). Although, we revealed a significant association of the genotype A/A of MICA-250 in patients with RA compared to healthy controls (pc = 0.033). In contrast, no significant differences between alleles and genotypes frequencies were found either with MICA-TM or MICA met129 val (P > 0.05) in our sample. Moreover, stratification of patients with RA according to clinical and immunological data for the different polymorphisms studied shows a significant association of both MICA-250 G allele (pc = 0.0075) and MICA-250 GG genotype (pc = 0.008) and both allelic (val) (pc = 0.021) and genotypic (val/val) distribution (pc = 0.0095) for MICA met129 val in the RF-positive subgroup compared to RF-negative patients with RA. In contrast, we found a strong association of the MICA-TM A9 allele in RF-negative patients with RA (pc = 0.0003). This study indicates the involvement of the MICA-250 polymorphism in the genetic susceptibility and severity to RA and suggests that variations in MICA-TM and MICA met129 val may have an effect on RA severity in our south Tunisian sample.",

Previous analysis of data from the International HapMap Project indicated that a CD36 haplotype bearing a nonsense mutation (T1264G; rs3211938) had undergone recent positive selection in the Yoruba of Nigeria. To investigate the global distribution of this putative selection event, we genotyped T1264G in 3420 individuals from 66 populations. We confirmed the high frequency of 1264G in the Yoruba (26%). However, the 1264G allele is less common in other African populations and absent from all non-African populations without recent African admixture. Using long-range linkage disequilibrium, we studied two West African groups in depth. Evidence for recent positive selection at the locus was demonstrable in the Yoruba, although not in Gambians. We screened 70 variants from across CD36 for an association with severe malaria phenotypes, employing a case-control study of 1350 subjects and a family study of 1288 parent-offspring trios. No marker was significantly associated with severe malaria. We focused on T1264G, genotyping 10,922 samples from four African populations. The nonsense allele was not associated with severe malaria (pooled allelic odds ratio 1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.89-1.12; P = 0.98). These results suggest a range of possible explanations including the existence of alternative selection pressures on CD36, co-evolution between host and parasite or confounding caused by allelic heterogeneity of CD36 deficiency.",

Therefore, the gene encoding IL-10 (IL10) is an attractive candidate for association studies attempting to identify susceptibility genes conferring risk of UTIs. In this case-control study, we aimed to investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of IL10 with acute pyelonephritis in the Slovak population. Polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers was used to analyse IL10 -1082A/G (rs1800896), -819C/T (rs1800871) and -592C/A (rs1800872) SNPs in 147 children with acute pyelonephritis and 215 healthy controls. Comparison of patients with healthy controls using the logistic regression analysis revealed significantly increased risk of developing recurrent attacks of acute pyelonephritis for -1082 G allele in a dominant genetic model GG (GG + AG vs. AA, P = 0.019, odds ratio (OR) = 2.26). A similar tendency was also found when the recurrent acute pyelonephritis subgroup was compared to episodic pyelonephritis cases (GG + AG vs. AA, P = 0.009, OR = 3.38). In conclusion, our results suggest that IL10 -1082 A/G SNP is a susceptibility factor for development of recurrent attacks of acute pyelonephritis.",

It is also a very expensive drug. Though the response rate of R-CHOP is higher than that of CHOP alone, patients may still experience a poor response. One possible mechanism that may mediate the poor response to R-CHOP is poor binding of the drug to the CD20 molecule, perhaps due to mutations or polymorphisms of the CD20 gene that affect its structure. To test this hypothesis and perhaps define a new predictor of R-CHOP response, our pilot study evaluated the CD20 gene sequence from patients exhibiting a poor outcome to R-CHOP.\n<b>Methods</b>: Eleven patients with DLBCL who exhibited a recurrence of their disease and/or died within 24 months of R-CHOP treatment were categorized as showing poor progression-free survival (poor outcomes). Paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from the original tumors were evaluated for mutations or polymorphisms of the CD20 gene. Furthermore, sections from these patients and as well as from matched control patients who were categorized as good outcome patients (no progression of their disease within 36 months) were stained with anti-CD20 antibody and compared for CD20 protein expression.\n<b>Results</b>: DNA sequence analyses revealed that no mutations were observed in DNA from the coding region of the CD20 gene in any of the initial tumors from 11 patients who showed poor outcomes with R-CHOP therapy. One case showed a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 2 (C216T; rs2070770; Ile>>Ile). No significant differences in CD20 expression was observed between good and poor outcome patients with R-CHOP.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our results do not support association of CD20 mutations in specimens of the initial tumor or structural polymorphisms of the CD20 gene with patients who exhibited poor outcomes to R-CHOP.",

                "text": "Variants in serotonergic genes are implicated in nicotine dependence (ND) in subjects of European and African origin, but their involvement with smoking in Asians is largely unknown. Moreover, mechanisms underlying the ND risk-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes are rarely investigated. The Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score was used to assess ND in 2616 male Chinese Han smokers. Both association and interaction analysis were used to examine the association of variants in the serotonergic genes with FTND. Further, expression and methylation quantitative trait loci (cis-mQTL) analysis was employed to determine the association of individual SNPs with the extent of methylation of each CpG locus. Individual SNP-based association analysis revealed that rs1176744 in HTR3B was marginally associated with FTND (p = 0.042). Haplotype-based association analysis found that one major haplotype, T-T-A-G, formed by SNPs rs3758987-rs4938056-rs1176744-rs2276305, located in the 5' region of HTR3B, showed a significant association with FTND (p = 0.00025). Further, a significant genetic interactive effect affecting ND was detected among SNPs rs10160548 in HTR3A, and rs3758987, rs2276305, and rs1672717 in HTR3B (p = 0.0074). Finally, we found four CpG sites (CpG_4543549, CpG_4543464, CpG_4543682, and CpG_4546888) to be significantly associated with three cis-mQTL SNPs (i.e., rs3758987, rs4938056, and rs1176744) located in our detected haplotype within HTR3B. In sum, we showed SNP rs1176744 (Tyr129Ser) to be associated with ND. Together with the SNPs rs3758987 and rs4938056 in HTR3B, they formed a major haplotype, which had significant association with ND. We further showed these SNPs contribute to ND through four methylated sites in HTR3B. All these findings suggest that variants in the serotonergic system play an important role in ND in the Chinese Han population. More importantly, these findings demonstrated that the involvement of this system in ND is through gene-by-gene interaction and methylation.",

Sanger sequencing was used to validate >10% of KASPar's results. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the distribution of allelic and genotype frequency between cases and controls, and the Bonferroni correction was set at P<0.05.\n<b>Results</b>: The minor allele frequency of rs75932628-T was 0.009 in cases and was not found in any healthy controls which suggests a significant association between rs75932628-T and LOAD risk in our sample (P=0.010). The rs143332484-T variant did not exhibit a significant association (P=0.160), whereas rs104894002 and rs142232675 were not found.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our findings suggest that the rs75932628-T variant of TREM2 is an important risk factor for LOAD in the Colombian population.",

This study is the first to associate this polymorphism with a human phenotype. The frequency of the major A allele was 0.53 and that of the minor C allele was 0.47. The -412A>C polymorphism was not linked to the well-known -3826A>G (rs1800592; mid R:D'mid R:=0.60 and r(2)=0.33), yielding four predicted haplotypes from these two polymorphisms. We associated -412A>C, -3826A>G and their haplotypes with computed tomography-measured body fat areas from 367 Korean female subjects. The G allele of -3826A>G and the C allele of -412A>C were significantly associated with larger areas of abdominal subcutaneous fat in a dominant model (p=0.001 and p=0.0004, respectively); combining them together (ht2[GC]) enhanced this significance (p=0.00005). In contrast, presence of the A allele in both polymorphisms (ht1[AA]) was significantly associated with smaller areas of abdominal subcutaneous fat (p=0.003). We observed no significant associations between these UCP1 genetic polymorphisms and thigh fat areas, visceral fat areas, or blood biochemical profiles, suggesting that this polymorphism might differentially affect fat accumulation in different parts of the human body, even though further study is needed to elucidate the mechanism of it.",

For this reason, a meta-analysis was conducted to identify the potential correlation after pooling data from eligible case-control studies. Search strategies were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and the COCHRANE Library in English and from VIP, CNKI and Sinomed in Chinese (all the papers were published before November 11, 2012) using appropriate terms. A total of 2,279 cases and 2,360 controls from four related case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. According to the three eligible populations, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the risk of breast cancer for the CG versus CC and GG versus CC genotypes and the G versus C allele were 0.84 and 0.72-0.98, 0.92 and 0.32-2.61, and 0.98 and 0.84-1.13, respectively. The OR and 95% CI for CG+GG versus CC from the four study populations were 0.85 and 0.73-0.98, respectively. This meta-analysis supported the fact that the G allele of PPAR'\u03b32 Pro12Ala (rs1801282) modestly affects the risk of breast cancer. Nevertheless, further studies are required to enrich the evidence of this correlation.",

The val(158)met single nucleotide polymorphism (rs4680) in the COMT gene has received considerable attention as a candidate gene for schizophrenia as well as for frontally mediated cognitive functions. Antisaccade performance is a good measure of frontal lobe integrity. Deficits on the task are considered a trait marker for schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of COMT val(158)met polymorphism with antisaccade eye movements in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Schizophrenia patients (N = 105) and healthy controls (N = 95) underwent infrared oculographic assessment of antisaccades. Subjects were genotyped for COMT val(158)met and divided into 3 groups according to genotype (val/val, val/met, and met/met). Patients displayed significantly more reflexive errors, longer and more variable latency, and lower amplitude gain than controls (all P < 0.02). A greater number of val(158) alleles was associated with shorter (P = 0.045) and less variable (P = 0.028) antisaccade latency and, nonsignificantly, with lower reflexive error rate (P = 0.056). None of these variables showed a group-by-genotype interaction (P > 0.1). There were no significant associations of genotype with measures of amplitude gain or spatial error (P > 0.2). The results suggest that COMT val(158) carrier status is associated with better performance on the antisaccade task. Possible explanations of this finding are discussed.",

Association of FcGR and TNFA gene polymorphisms with chronic periodontitis (CP) susceptibility has been found to be diverse among different ethnic populations. Objectives of the present study are to determine association of functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FcGR and TNF-\u03b1 genes with CP susceptibility in a cohort from South India.\n<b>Methods</b>: Polymorphisms of: 1) FCGR2A 131His/Arg (rs1801274); 2) FCGR2B 232Ile/Thr (rs1050501); 3) TNFA -1031T/C (rs1799964); and 4) TNFA -863C/A (rs1800630) were analyzed among patients with healthy gingiva (n = 176) and patients with CP (n = 177). Genotyping was performed using allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Association between CP and SNPs was examined by multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for: 1) age; 2) sex; and 3) oral hygiene index (OHI). Epistatic interaction between FcGR polymorphisms and interleukin 1B (IL1B) +3954C/T (rs1143634) was assessed using multifactorial dimensionality reduction analysis.\n<b>Results</b>: Among four SNPs analyzed, only FCGR2A 131His/Arg showed significant association with CP in a dominant model (odds ratio: 1.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.028 to 2.530). This significance disappeared after correcting for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni analysis, or after adjusting for age, sex, and OHI. A significant redundant interaction between IL1B +3954 C/T and FCGR2A 131His/Arg was observed.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Study results suggest the variant form of the SNP in FCGR2A 131His/Arg, FCGR2B 232Ile/Thr, TNFA -1031T/C, and TNFA -863C/A are not associated with CP susceptibility in the selected cohort from South India.",

For better understanding of the effect of TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism on endometriosis risk, we performed a meta-analysis.\n<b>Methods</b>: The relevant studies were identified through a search of PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Ovid, Springer, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), cqvip, Wanfang database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM) databases up to December, 2014. The association between the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and endometriosis risk was pooled by conducted by odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.\n<b>Results</b>: A total of fifteen case-control studies with 2683 cases and 3335 controls were eventually identified. There was significant association between Arg72Pro polymorphism and endometriosis risk in all of the five models in overall populations (C vs. G: OR=1.32, 95%CI=1.14-1.53, p=0.00; CC vs. GG: OR=1.80, 95%CI=1.28-2.53, p=0.001; GC vs. GG: OR=1.52, 95%CI=1.22-1.88, p=0.00; CC vs.\n<b>Gc/gg</b>: OR=1.32, 95%CI=1.05-1.66, p=0.016; CC/GC vs. GG: OR=1.59, 95%CI=1.26-2.00, p=0.00). In the sub-group analysis according to ethnicity, the results suggested that TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism was not associated with endometriosis risk in Caucasians. However, the significant association was found in Asians and Mixed race (MIX) under the five models.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism can increase the risk of endometriosis, especially among Asians and MIX populations. Considering the limited sample size and ethnicities included in the meta-analysis, further larger scaled and well-designed studies are needed to confirm our results.",

In addition XPD rs13181 was also found to be associated with male POAG patients (\u03c7(2) = 12.1 [p < 0.005]), for both dominant (OR = 2.44 [95% CI = 1.33-4.47], p < 0.005) as well as recessive model (OR = 3.62 [95% CI = 1.45-9.01], p < 0.01). Combined genotypes of both the genes revealed that the heterozygote AC/GA was significantly associated with the male POAG patients (z = 3.00 [p < 0.001]). The AA/GG genotype was present at a higher frequency in the male controls and the AA/GA in the female controls and could thus have a protective role in males and females, respectively.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: We postulate that defects in the DNA repair genes XRCC1 and XPD may possibly be associated with the progression of POAG in male patients of Pakistani origin.",

The rare alleles of two independent SNPs were associated with decreased risk of psoriasis--rs35667974 (Ile923Val): odds ratio (OR) for minor allele carriers is 0.43, P=2.36 \u00d7 10(-5) (2,098 cases vs. 1,748 controls); and rs10930046 (His460Arg): OR for minor allele carriers is 0.51, P=6.47 \u00d7 10(-4) (2,098 cases vs. 1,744 controls). Compared to noncarriers, carriers of the 923Val and/or 460Arg variants were protected from psoriasis (OR=0.46, P=5.56 \u00d7 10(-8)).

                "text": "<b>Background</b>: Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR) is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating and a promising endophenotype of schizophrenia. We have recently shown that the linked serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT(2A)R) A-1438 G and T102C polymorphisms modulate PPI in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, it was shown that genetic variation in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and the neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) proteins influences PPI in schizophrenia patients and healthy volunteers. Therefore, we aimed to replicate these results and investigated the impact of the related polymorphisms on PPI in healthy human volunteers.\n<b>Methods</b>: We analyzed the 5-HT(2A)R A-1438 G/T102C (rs6311/rs6313), the COMT Val158Met (rs4680), and the NRG-1 Arg38Gln (rs3924999) polymorphisms, assessing startle reactivity, habituation, and PPI of ASR in 107 healthy Caucasian volunteers.\n<b>Results</b>: Subjects homozygous for the 5-HT(2A)R T102C-T/A-1438 G-A allele showed increased PPI levels. In particular, male subjects with the COMT Met158Met-genotype also showed elevated PPI. The NRG-1 Arg38Gln genotype did not have a significant impact on PPI. Startle reactivity was not affected by any of the investigated polymorphisms.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: We confirmed in an independent sample of healthy volunteers that PPI is influenced by genetic variation in the 5-HT(2A)R gene. The influence of the COMT Val158Met genotype on PPI appears to be sex-specific. These results underscore the significance of the serotonin and dopamine systems in the modulation of sensorimotor gating.",

Population-based studies have established that, since the frequency of this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) varies between geographic regions, the associated proportion of prostate cancer (PrCa) risk contribution is also highly variable by country.\n<b>Patients And Methods</b>: This is the largest comprehensive case-control study assessing the prevalence of the HOXB13 G84E variant to date and is the first in the UK population. We genotyped 8652 men diagnosed with PrCa within the UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study (UKGPCS) and 5252 healthy men from the UK ProtecT study.\n<b>Results</b>: HOXB13 G84E was identified in 0.5% of the healthy controls and 1.5% of the PrCa cases, and it was associated with a 2.93-fold increased risk of PrCa [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94-4.59; P = 6.27 \u00d7 10(-8)]. The risk was even higher among men with family history of PrCa [odds ratio (OR) = 4.53, 95% CI 2.86-7.34; P = 3.1 \u00d7 10(-8)] and in young-onset PrCa (diagnosed up to the age of 55 years; OR = 3.11, 95% CI 1.98-5.00; P = 6.1 \u00d7 10(-7)). There was no significant association between Gleason Score, presenting prostate specific antigen, tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage or NCCN risk group and carrier status. HOXB13 G84E was not associated with overall or cancer-specific survival. We found that the polygenic PrCa risk score (PR score), calculated using the 71 known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PrCa and the HOXB13 G84E variant act multiplicatively on PrCa risk. Based on the estimated prevalence and risk, this rare variant explains \u223c1% of the familial risk of PrCa in the UK population.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The clinical importance of HOXB13 G84E in PrCa management has not been established. This variant was found to have no effect on prognostic implications but could be used for stratifying screening, by identifying men at high risk.\n<b>Clinical Trials Numbers</b>: Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT): NCT02044172.\n<b>Uk Genetic Prostate Cancer Study</b>: Epidemiology and Molecular Genetics Studies (UKGPCS): NCT01737242.",

We hypothesized that such polymorphisms may correlate with survival outcomes among advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We evaluated the association between VEGF polymorphisms and overall survival among patients with advanced NSCLC who were treated with at least one cytotoxic regimen at Kyoto University Hospital between 2003 and 2008. We investigated the following VEGF polymorphisms: -460T > C (rs833061), +405G > C (rs2010963), +936C > T (rs3025039), -1154G > A (rs1570360), and -2578C > A (rs699947). Analyses of genotype associations with survival outcomes were performed using Cox proportional models, Kaplan-Meier methods, and the log-rank test. There were 126 patients and 80 deaths. On a Cox regression analysis of a current and former smoker (hazards ratio [HR], 1.422; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.111-1.859; P = 0.0046), poor performance status (PS) (HR, 2.524; 95% CI, 1.483-3.827; P = 0.0019), the VEGF -460CC genotype (HR, 1.719; 95% CI, 1.166-2.390; P = 0.0084), VEGF -1154AA and AG genotypes (HR, 1.482; 95% CI, 1.144-1.897; P = 0.0034), and VEGF -2578AA genotype (HR, 1.797; 95% CI, 1.219-2.495; P = 0.0047) had a significant prognostic effect on survival based on univariate analysis.

Two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, V249I (rs3732379) and T280M (rs3732378), are located in the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains of the CX3CR1 protein, respectively. Previous studies have indicated significant associations between T280M and leukocyte functional characteristics, including adhesion, signaling, and chemotaxis, while the function of V249I is unclear. In the brain, microglia are the only proven and widely accepted CX3CR1-expressing cells. This study aimed to specify whether there were specific brain regions on which these two single nucleotide polymorphisms exert their biological impacts through their functional effects on microglia.\n<b>Methods</b>: Associations between the single nucleotide polymorphisms and brain characteristics, including gray and white matter volumes, white matter integrity, resting arterial blood volume, and cerebral blood flow, were evaluated among 1300 healthy Japanese individuals.\n<b>Results</b>: The major allele carriers (V249 and T280) were significantly associated with an increased total arterial blood volume of the whole brain, especially around the bilateral precuneus, left posterior cingulate cortex, and left posterior parietal cortex. There were no significant associations between the genotypes and other brain structural indicators.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: This finding suggests that the CX3CR1 variants may affect arterial structures in the brain, possibly via interactions between microglia and brain microvascular endothelial cells.",

We hypothesized that polymorphisms in the SOD3 gene would be associated with COPD and COPD-related phenotypes. We genotyped three SOD3 polymorphisms (rs8192287 (E1), rs8192288 (I1), and rs1799895 (R213G)) in a case-control cohort, with severe COPD cases from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT, n = 389) and smoking controls from the Normative Aging Study (NAS, n = 472). We examined whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with COPD status, lung function variables, and quantitative computed tomography (CT) measurements of emphysema and airway wall thickness. Furthermore, we tried to replicate our initial findings in two family-based studies, the International COPD Genetics Network (ICGN, n = 3061) and the Boston Early-Onset COPD Study (EOCOPD, n = 949). In NETT COPD cases, the minor alleles of SNPs E1 and I1 were associated with a higher percentage of emphysema (%LAA950) on chest CT scan (p = .029 and p = .0058). The association with E1 was replicated in the ICGN family study, where the minor allele was associated with more emphysema (p = .048). Airway wall thickness was positively associated with the E1 SNP in ICGN; however, this finding was not confirmed in NETT. Quantitative CT data were not available in EOCOPD. The SNPs were not associated with lung function variables or COPD status in any of the populations. In conclusion, polymorphisms in the SOD3 gene were associated with CT emphysema but not COPD susceptibility, highlighting the importance of phenotype definition in COPD genetics studies.",

A recent study has suggested that the functionally relevant variant rs642961 is the underlying cause of the observed associations. We genotyped rs642961 in our Central European case-control sample of 460 NSCL/P patients and 952 controls. In order to investigate whether other IRF6 variants contribute independently to the etiology of NSCL/P, we also genotyped the non-synonymous coding variant V274I (rs2235371) and five IRF6-haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A highly significant result was observed for rs642961 (P = 1.44 x 10(-6)) in our sample. The odds ratio was 1.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38-2.22] for the heterozygous genotype and 1.94 (95% CI: 1.21-3.10) for the homozygous genotype, values that are similar to those reported in a previously published family-based study. Our results thus confirm the involvement of the IRF6 variant, rs642961, in the etiology of NSCL/P in the Central European population. We also found evidence suggestive of an independent protective effect of the coding variant V274I. In order to understand fully the genetic architecture of the IRF6 locus, it will be necessary to conduct additional SNP-based and resequencing studies using large samples of patients.",

The 825C>T polymorphism (rs5443) of the G-protein beta 3 (GNB3) subunit gene has a strong influence on clinical signs of sympathetic activity in cardiac research. This study was carried out in order to test the hypothesis that carriers of the T allele have an increased sympathetic activity in opiate withdrawal.\n<b>Methods</b>: Thirty-nine monovalent opiate addicted patients consecutively admitted to a detoxification ward were investigated. The main parameter for sympathetic activity was the pulse rate in the first 3 days after the regular end of gradual methadone reduction.\n<b>Results</b>: Thirty-three out of 39 patients achieved a drug-free state: 22 carried a T allele (TT, CT), 11 belonged to the CC genotype group. The pulse rate was significantly (p<0.05) raised in the T allele group compared to the CC genotype group on the first 2 days after stopping methadone administration. In addition, about a third of the T allele carriers needed clonidine treatment on the respective days, but only one patient among the 11 CC homozygotes. There was no significant difference between groups in systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as in subjective withdrawal ratings.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: A group difference regarding pulse rate could be observed in a small sample and despite a higher degree of concomitant clonidine medication in T allele carriers. The failure to detect group differences in blood pressure and self-rated withdrawal symptoms may be attributed to the more complex regulation of blood pressure and the known weak correlation between objective and subjective withdrawal symptoms.",

Genotyping was performed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of PCR-amplified fragments. Two nasal swab cultures were taken within 2 weeks before the operation. Subjects were classified as Staphylococcus aureus carriers if at least one culture was positive while those patients with both cultures found to be negative were classified as non-carriers.\n<b>Results</b>: The prevalence of nasal S. aureus carriage in the final cohort was 22.1% (66/299), while no MRSA was detected in our study group. No significant differences in the TLR2 polymorphisms were observed between the study and the control groups. No associations were found between TLR2 haplotypes and the covariates of age, sex, NYHA, weight, height, BMI, CAD, smoking status and ESlog score.

TLR2 Arg753Gln genotyping showed that GA heterozygous patients were detected more frequently in the group of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriers than in non-carrier adults.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Our results suggest that the carrier status for the GA variant of the TLR2 Arg753Gln (rs5743708) polymorphism may be a risk factor for Staphylococcus aureus carriage.",

                "text": "In rodents, the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) has been established as a reliable measure of waiting impulsivity being defined as the ability to regulate a response in anticipation of reinforcement. Key brain structures are the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and prefrontal regions (for example, pre- and infralimbic cortex), which are, together with other transmitters, modulated by serotonin. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we examined 103 healthy males while performing the 5-CSRTT measuring brain activation in humans by means of a paradigm that has been widely applied in rodents. Subjects were genotyped for the tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2; G-703T; rs4570625) variant, an enzyme specific for brain serotonin synthesis. We addressed neural activation patterns of waiting impulsivity and the interaction between the NAcc and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) using dynamic causal modeling. Genetic influence was examined via interaction analyses between the TPH2 genotype (GG homozygotes vs T allele carriers) and the degree of impulsivity as measured by the 5-CSRTT. We found that the driving input of the vmPFC was reduced in highly impulsive T allele carriers (reflecting a reduced top-down control) in combination with an enhanced response in the NAcc after correct target processing (reflecting an augmented response to monetary reward). Taken together, we found a high overlap of our findings with reports from animal studies in regard to the underlying cognitive processes, the brain regions associated with waiting impulsivity and the neural interplay between the NAcc and vmPFC. Therefore, we conclude that the 5-CSRTT is a promising tool for translational studies.",

The p21 gene on chromosome 6p21.2 can be stimulated by an activated TP53 gene. A product of transcription, the p21 protein, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, has its function in gene repair and angiogenesis during cell division, and can regulate apoptosis. The purpose of this analysis was to examine for an association between the genotypes measured on two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the TP53 and p21 genes.\n<b>Methods</b>: In a clinical epidemiological case-control study, 814 individuals were recruited. 550 samples (275 cases/275 control) of peripheral blood obtained from women (aged 22-87 years) with breast cancer and from healthy women (aged 23-87 years) were genotyped for frequencies of the following gene variances: R72P/rs1042522 (gene TP53) and S31R/ss4388499 (gene p21).\n<b>Results</b>: For the variance in gene TP53 no significant differences between the control group and women with breast cancer could be estimated. For the variance in gene p21 a statistically significant association between the SNP measured within p21 and breast cancer status was observed. The odds ratio for the increased risk for those carrying the CA genotype as opposed to the CC genotype is 1.74 (95% confidence ratio = 1.00-3.05).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Despite this finding p21 does not appear to act as an exclusive prognostic marker for breast cancer disease.",

                "text": "TLR7 agonists are of high interest for the treatment of cancer, auto-immunity and chronic viral infections. They are known to activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to produce high amounts of Type I Interferon (IFN) and to facilitate T and B cell responses, the latter with the help of maturation markers such as CD40, CD80 and CD86. The TLR7 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs179008 (GLn11Leu), sex and chronic viral infection have all been reported to influence pDC IFN production. It is unknown, however, whether these factors also influence pDC phenotypic maturation and thereby IFN-independent pDC functions. Furthermore, it is unclear whether SNP rs179008 influences HBV susceptibility and/or clearance. Here we investigated whether the SNP rs179008, sex and HBV infection affected phenotypic maturation of pDCs from 38 healthy individuals and 28 chronic HBV patients. In addition, we assessed SNP prevalence in a large cohort of healthy individuals (n = 231) and chronic HBV patients (n = 1054). Consistent with previous reports, the rs179008 variant allele was largely absent in Asians and more prevalent in Caucasians. Among Caucasians, the SNP was equally prevalent in healthy and chronically infected males. The SNP was, however, significantly more prevalent in healthy females than in those with chronic HBV infection (42 versus 28%), suggesting that in females it may offer protection from chronic infection. Ex vivo experiments demonstrated that induction of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 by TLR7 ligands, but not TLR9 ligands, was augmented in pDCs from healthy SNP-carrying females. Furthermore, CD80 and CD86 upregulation was more pronounced in females independent of the SNP. Lastly, our data suggested that chronic HBV infection impairs pDC maturation. These findings provide insight into factors determining TLR7 responses, which is important for further clinical development of TLR7-based therapies.",

In this study, we performed deep sequencing of APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, GRN, APOE and MAPT genes in individuals with extreme CSF A\u03b242, tau, or ptau levels. One known pathogenic mutation (PSEN1 p.A426P), four high-risk variants for AD (APOE p.L46P, MAPT p.A152T, PSEN2 p.R62H and p.R71W) and nine novel variants were identified. Surprisingly, a coding variant in PSEN1, p.E318G (rs17125721-G) exhibited a significant association with high CSF tau (p = 9.2 \u00d7 10(-4)) and ptau (p = 1.8 \u00d7 10(-3)) levels. The association of the p.E318G variant with A\u03b2 deposition was observed in APOE-\u03b54 allele carriers. Furthermore, we found that in a large case-control series (n = 5,161) individuals who are APOE-\u03b54 carriers and carry the p.E318G variant are at a risk of developing AD (OR = 10.7, 95% CI = 4.7-24.6) that is similar to APOE-\u03b54 homozygous (OR = 9.9, 95% CI = 7.2.9-13.6), and double the risk for APOE-\u03b54 carriers that do not carry p.E318G (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 3.4-4.4). The p.E318G variant is present in 5.3% (n = 30) of the families from a large clinical series of LOAD families (n = 565) and exhibited a higher frequency in familial LOAD (MAF = 2.5%) than in sporadic LOAD (MAF = 1.6%) (p = 0.02). Additionally, we found that in the presence of at least one APOE-\u03b54 allele, p.E318G is associated with more A\u03b2 plaques and faster cognitive decline. We demonstrate that the effect of PSEN1, p.E318G on AD susceptibility is largely dependent on an interaction with APOE-\u03b54 and mediated by an increased burden of A\u03b2 deposition.",

PCR-based ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method was used to genotype four SNPs of ABCG1, three (rs2234714, rs2234715 and rs57137919) in the promoter region and one (rs1044317) in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR).\n<b>Results</b>: The human ABCG1 -367G>A polymorphism (rs57137919) showed a significantly decreased risk for CAD and myocardial infarction (MI) in a dominant model (adjusted OR = 0.73, p = 0.033 for CAD, and adjusted OR = 0.65, p = 0.014 for MI, respectively). The rs57137919 also showed an association with angiographic severity of CAD (multi-vessel vs. single-vessel CAD, adjusted OR = 0.40, p = 0.005). The findings were further supported by luciferase reporter assay, in which the polymorphism impaired reporter gene expression. The ABCG1 -768G>A polymorphism (rs2234714) showed an association with CAD in a recessive model (adjusted OR = 0.64, p = 0.015), but did not demonstrate a functional influence on reporter gene expression in the luciferase reporter assay.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The SNP rs57137919 in the ABCG1 promoter region is functionally associated with a reduced risk of CAD in a Chinese Han population.",

In this study we have explored the effect of genetic variations in PARP-1 gene in brain tumorigenesis. This case control study comprised of 500 brain tumor cases along with 500 healthy controls. Three polymorphisms of PARP-1 gene, rs1136410 (Val762Ala), rs1805404 (Asp81Asp) and rs1805414 (Ala284Ala) were analyzed using AS-PCR method followed by DNA sequencing. Joint effect model, haplotype analysis and linkage disequilibrium of these polymorphisms was assessed using Haploview 4.2. In rs1136410 (Val762Ala) heterozygous mutant genotype (CT) was observed notably lower (OR: 0.44., 95% CI: 0.33-0.57., p<0.0001) in brain tumor patients compared to controls and ~2 fold increased frequency of homozygous mutant genotype (CC) was observed in brain tumor patients versus controls (OR: 1.51., 95%CI: 1.16-1.96, p = 0.001). In rs1805414 (Ala284Ala), frequency of heterozygous mutant genotype (CT) was observed lower (OR: 0.77., 95% CI: 0.60-0.99., p = 0.05) in patients versus controls. In rs1805404 (Asp81Asp), heterozygous mutant genotyping (CT) was observed lower in brain tumor patients compared with the healthy controls (OR: 0.63., 95% CI: 0.48-0.83., p = 0.001). However, homozygous mutant genotype (TT) was observed increased in patients compared to controls (OR: 1.41., 95% CI:1.07-1.85., p = 0.01). We assessed the fact that in combination the PARP-1 gene SNPs, rs1136410 (Val762Ala), rs1805414 (Ala284Ala) and rs1805404 (Asp81Asp) may increase the brain pathogenesis at least in Pakistani population.",

                "text": "Severe Malarial Anemia (SMA), a life-threatening childhood Plasmodium falciparum malaria syndrome requiring urgent blood transfusion, exhibits inflammatory and hemolytic pathology. Differentiating between hypo-haptoglobinemia due to hemolysis or that of genetic origin is key to understand SMA pathogenesis. We hypothesized that while malaria-induced hypo-haptoglobinemia should reverse at recovery, that of genetic etiology should not. We carried-out a case-control study of children living under hyper-endemic holoendemic malaria burden in the sub-Saharan metropolis of Ibadan, Nigeria. We show that hypo-haptoglobinemia is a risk factor for childhood SMA and not solely due to intravascular hemolysis from underlying schizogony. In children presenting with SMA, hypo-haptoglobinemia remains through convalescence to recovery suggesting a genetic cause. We identified a haptoglobin gene variant, rs12162087 (g.-1203G > A, frequency = 0.67), to be associated with plasma haptoglobin levels (p = 8.5 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup>). The Homo-Var:(AA) is associated with high plasma haptoglobin while the reference Homo-Ref:(GG) is associated with hypo-haptoglobinemia (p = 2.3 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup>). The variant is associated with SMA, with the most support for a risk effect for Homo-Ref genotype. Our insights on regulatory haptoglobin genotypes and hypo-haptoglobinemia suggest that haptoglobin screening could be part of risk-assessment algorithms to prevent rapid disease progression towards SMA in regions with no-access to urgent blood transfusion where SMA accounts for high childhood mortality rates.",

                "text": "KIT is a growth factor receptor, important for normal germ cell migration and development. The malfunction of KIT gene results in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-KIT which is believed to be the major oncogenic event in stomach, small intestine mastocytosis, acute leukemias, melanomas and colon tumors. The genetics of these diseases could be better understood by knowing the functional relevance of their SNP variation. In this study, a computational analysis to detect the most deleterious nonsynonymous SNPs of KIT gene was performed and investigated its binding affinity to native and predicted mutant protein structure (D816V) with sunitinib and HDAC (Trichostatin A and Panobinostat) inhibitors was investigated. Out of 1,288 SNPs retrieved from dbSNP database against KIT gene, 11 non-synonymous SNPs were detected to be damaging and deleterious by SIFT, PolyPhen and I-Mutant2.0 servers. Further, we modeled the mutant protein based on the deleterious nsSNP (rs121913507) and showed that the mutation from Aspartic acid to Valine at 816 position exhibit greatest impact on stability. The RMSD values of mutant and native structures are found to be 0.40 and 1.9 A, respectively. Furthermore, the binding affinity of sunitinib and HDAC inhibitors were compared with native and mutant protein. In this regard, it was found that trichostatin A has a high binding efficacy towards the mutant protein with a binding energy of -35.274 kcal mol(-1), as compared to the native structure which has a binding energy of -25.996 kcal mol(-1). Also, the FastSNP tool suggested that 3 SNPs found to affect protein splicing site and splicing regulation. From present results, it was clear that the non-synonymous SNP rs121913507 (D816V) could be the most deleterious SNP for KIT gene and HDAC inhibitors can serve as a best drug for the mutant protein.",

Recent research has suggested that BDNF may be implicated in the etiology of mood disorders and schizophrenia, as well as in the therapeutic action of some drugs, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics. This study aimed to develop a simple, fast and accurate new method for detecting the Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene in schizophrenia patients using melting-curve analysis and a DNA-specific dye, SYBR Green I. A group of 30 schizophrenia patients were analyzed to detect the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) using the new genotyping method based on the analysis of fluorescence melting curves of PCR products that were labeled with SYBR Green I. The genotype results were confirmed for all 30 samples using the specific BDNF TaqMan allele discrimination assay. This new method allows the analysis of both alleles in the same reaction tube using SYBR Green I, with no need for additional steps. The addition of a GC clamp makes this method universally applicable, since the melting temperature of one allele can be adjusted as necessary to give the distinctive separation of melting curves. Therefore, this new method is simple, fast and accurate for determining the presence of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. It may also be useful for the analysis of other SNPs in pharmacogenetic studies.",

                "text": "Experimental and clinical studies suggest that oxidative stress is an important pathogenetic mechanism of both essential hypertension (EH) and cerebral stroke (CS). In this paper, we investigated, for the first time, the relationship between polymorphisms of two genes for antioxidant defense enzymes such as catalase (CAT) and flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) and the risk of CS in hypertensive patients. DNA samples obtained from 667 unrelated Russian patients with EH (306 patients with CS, and 361 patients without cerebrovascular accidents) were genotyped for polymorphisms -21A>T (rs7943316) of the CAT gene and E158K (rs2266782) of the FMO3 gene. We found that the -21AA CAT genotype is associated with increased risk of CS in hypertensive males (OR = 1.77 95% CI 1.01-3.07). No significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies of the FMO3 E1 58K polymorphism have been revealed between the groups. The association analysis stratified by the environmental risk factors showed that the -21AA CAT genotype increased the risk of CS in male smokers (OR = 2.33 95% CI 1.40-5.40) as well as in male alcohol abusers (OR = 4.29 95% CI 1.22-15.12). In contrast, the variant genotypes such as an -21AT and -21TT of the CAT gene had a protective effect on the risk of CS in EH males with high or moderate physical activity (OR = 0.30 95% CI 0.11-0.83) and in those men who did not have life stresses (OR = 0.51 95% CI 0.28-0.90). The protective effect of the variant genotypes was also observed in high fruit and vegetable consumers (OR = 0.40 95% CI 0.17-0.93). This study is the first to show that the polymorphism -21A>T CAT is associated with increased risk of cerebral stroke in hypertensive men, however, the relationship between the polymorphism and risk of cerebrovascular disease depends on whether the patients have environmental risk factors or not.",

Two polymorphisms in the SRD5a2 gene, V89L (rs523349) and A49T (rs9282858), have been studied for associations with prostate cancer risk, with conflicting results. The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (1997-2007) to examine these associations and compared the results with findings from genome-wide association studies of prostate cancer. The meta-analysis included 24 case-control studies (10,088 cases and 10,120 controls for V89L and 4,998 cases and 5,451 controls for A49T). The authors found that prostate cancer was not associated with V89L (L allele vs. V allele: odds ratio = 0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.05) and was probably not associated with A49T (T allele vs. A allele: odds ratio = 1.10, 95% confidence interval: 0.86, 1.40). These results could have been distorted by spectrum-of-disease bias, convenience sampling of cases and controls, genotype misclassification, and/or confounding. Neither V89L nor A49T was included in microarray chips used for published genome-wide association studies. Analysis of well-designed population-based studies with pathway-based arrays containing common genetic variants could be useful for identifying genetic factors in prostate cancer.",

It is known that some markers of ovarian stimulation can help to personalize the treatment, adjusting the dose of exogenous rFSH, thus preventing excessive wear of the patient. Inspired on this information we aimed to analyze four different polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor genes ESR1: rs2234693/T-397C (PvuII) and rs9340799/A-351G (Xbal) and ESR2: rs4986938/G1082A (RsaI) and rs1256049/A + 1730G (AluI), and their association with assisted reproduction outcomes in Brazilian women that underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n<b>Methods</b>: A cross-sectional study was performed involving 136 infertile women less than 39 years of age with normal ovarian reserve. Patients were divided according to the same COH protocol for statistical analysis. The Taqman assay was used for PvuII and XbaI of ESR1, and RsaI and AluI of ESR2 genotyping. Serum estradiol and FSH were measured by Elisa assay.\n<b>Results</b>: The PvuII (ESR1) TT and RsaI (ESR2) GG genotypes were associated with a longer induction period and higher doses of medication (p < 0.03). The XbaI (ESR1) AA genotype was associated with better COH results, including a larger number of follicles, mature oocytes, embryos, and good quality embryos (p < 0.05). The AluI GG genotype showed an association with the Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) (p = 0.03). According to the haplotype analysis of ER1 (PvuII/XbaI), we demonstrated that the CA combination increases by 0.68 the number of good quality embryos while the TG decreases it by 0.71 (p = 0.04).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: ER polymorphisms have an association with the assisted reproduction outcomes in Brazilian women.",

Polymorphisms in the NOS2A gene, which codes for the inducible nitric oxide synthase [(i)NOS], have been tested for association with several autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease or type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the existence of correlated levels of (i)NOS protein and synovial cell apoptosis in RA patients, pointed to NOS2A as a good candidate gene involved in RA predisposition. The role of NOS2A was studied in 405 Spanish RA patients and in 398 ethnically matched healthy controls, through the analysis of five SNPs: two at the NOS2A promoter (rs2779251 and 2779248), other two exonic markers (Asp(346)Asp (rs1137933) and Ser(608)Leu (rs22518)) and the last one located at intron 7 (rs3729508). We also included other two widely-used promoter polymorphisms: the insertion/deletion (TAAA/-) and the (CCTTT)n microsatellite. No individual association of each single-marker or haplotype was found with RA susceptibility. Our data show the low linkage disequilibrium between these NOS2A SNPs and the alleles of the (CCTTT)n microsatellite, corroborating in a Spanish population the observation previously described in British and Gambian population. The present data do not support a causative role of NOS2A polymorphisms in RA predisposition.",

IL12/18 promote TH<sub>1</sub>-differentiation, counteracting the TH<sub>2</sub>-driven asthma. Therefore, CD14 modulation could alter the TH<sub>2</sub>-differentiation and should be taken into account when studying asthma. To analyse the alteration in CD14 levels and its association with CD14 (-159 C/T) SNP (rs2569190) in Caucasian adults with stable allergic asthma, we performed a cross-sectional study (277 healthy subjects vs. 277 patients) where clinical parameters, CD14 values and the CD14 (-159 C/T) SNP were studied. Apart from typical biomarkers, we found an increment of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in allergic asthma, probably linked to monocyte activity. Indeed, we evidenced increased monocyte numbers, but lower CD14 expression and normalised sCD14 values in patients. Moreover, we noticed an association of the T allele (P = 0.0162) and TT genotype (P = 0.0196) of the CD14 SNP with a decreased risk of allergic asthma and augmented sCD14 levels. In conclusion, monocyte CD14 expression and normalized sCD14 values were reduced in stable state asthmatics, and this could be related to the presence of an expanded CD14<sup>low</sup> monocyte subset. This study also demonstrates that the CD14 (-159 C/T) polymorphism is a risk factor for moderate-severe allergic asthma in adult Caucasians.",

                "text": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a fatal emerging acute viral infection. Not much is known regarding the pathogenic mechanisms and the reasons behind severe or mild disease courses in CCHF. IFN-alpha (IFNA) is one of the essential cytokines in the immune system. Existence of single nucleotide gene polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokines can cause susceptibility or resistance to viral agents and different clinical courses. Hence, the relationship between SNPs in genes encoding cytokines (IFNA1 -1823G/A (rs1332190), IFNA5 -2529T/A (rs758236), IFNA10 Cys20stop (rs10119910), and IFNA17 Ile184Arg (rs9298814) SNPs and disease susceptibility were investigated. The associations between SNPs and CCHF prognosis were also studied. Total 150 patients with CCHF and 170 healthy individuals were enrolled. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP methods. The frequency of IFNA1 -1823 (rs1332190) GG genotype was significantly higher in control subjects than CCHF patients (20% vs. 8%; P = 0.01). For IFNA17 Ile184Arg (rs9298814) polymorphism, CCHF patients having TG genotype had a higher frequency than the control subjects (38% vs. 32.4%; P = 0.039). The distribution of TT + TG genotype frequencies was also significantly higher in CCHF group than the controls (97.3% vs. 91.8%; P = 0.049). Genotype and allele frequencies for IFNA subtypes between fatal and survivors were the same (P > 0.05). Genotype and allele frequencies between severe and mild/moderate CCHF patients were also the same (P > 0.05). The results show that IFNA1 rs1332190 and IFNA17 rs9298814 SNPs may play an important role in CCHF susceptibility. Determining the existence of other connections for IFNA SNPs and CCHF severity and fatality requires further investigations.",

Glucose and insulin levels were measured at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min for calculation of phenotypic endpoints of glipizide response. The challenge was aborted as a result of hypoglycaemia, defined as glucose <2.8 mmol/l or hypoglycaemia-related symptoms.\n<b>Results</b>: Carriers with two reduced function alleles had a 50% larger insulin area under the curve than carriers with zero or one copy (P=0.037), although this finding was primarily driven by an individual with a robust insulin response. In adjusted analyses, the risk of aborting the glipizide challenge was doubled in two-copy carriers (P=0.034). No significant findings were observed in glucose-based endpoints.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Carriers of two reduced function alleles in CYP2C9 may experience an increased insulin response to glipizide and be predisposed to a higher risk of hypoglycaemia, although no effect of genotype was seen in glucose-based measurements. Further studies are needed to clarify the utility of CYP2C9 genotyping to guide sulfonylurea treatment.",

We therefore aimed to evaluate this association via a meta-analysis. Data on 7 studies with a total of 4068 subjects were available and analyzed using the random-effects model with assessment of heterogeneity and publication bias. Overall comparison of 2238C with 2238T yielded a 23% reduced, albeit nonsignificant, risk for hypertension (95% CI: 0.38-1.59; P = .485), while accompanying significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 88.3%) and publication bias (P = .051). Subgroup analysis by study design demonstrated opposite associations between population-based (OR = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13-0.80; P = .015) and hospital-based studies (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 0.79-1.68; P = .454). Further meta-regression analysis exclusively indicated the significant influence of study design (P = .042) on heterogeneity. Taken together, these findings support the notion that carriers of 2238C allele were at moderate decreased risk of developing hypertension, whereas study design was identified as a potentially significant source of between-study heterogeneity.",

The purpose of the present study was to identify genetic variants associated with the long-term outcome of medically treated patients with TAA. A total of 103 medically-treated patients with TAA (13 aneurysms and 90 dissections) were retrospectively studied for their outcomes (mean follow-up period, 24 months). The genotypes for 95 polymorphisms of 89 candidate genes were determined by a method that combines the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology. Evaluation of genotype distributions by the Chi-square test and subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates revealed that the -340A\u2192G polymorphism (rs514921) of the matrix metallopeptidase 1 gene (MMP1) was significantly (P=0.0288) associated with the outcome of TAA, with the minor G allele being related to a favorable outcome. The aneurysm diameter was significantly (P=0.0167) smaller in the combined group of the AG and GG genotypes for this polymorphism than in subjects with the AA genotype. Kaplan-Meier survival curves constructed according to MMP1 genotypes showed a more favorable outcome of TAA (log-rank P=0.0146) in subjects with the G allele of rs514921. Determination of genotype for this polymorphism may prove informative for assessment of the long-term outcome of TAA.",

A total of 1061 hypertensives were recruited and received daily oral dosage of 150 mg irbesartan for 4 weeks. Predose BPs, BPs and blood irbesartan concentrations at postdose on the 28th day were all measured. Common functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the KLK1 gene were genotyped. On the basis of the HapMap data of Han Chinese in the Beijing population, two non-synonymous polymorphisms with minor allele frequency>0.1, SNP rs5517 (Glu162Lys) and rs5516 (Gln121Glu), were selected. Those with GG genotype in the rs5516 locus had higher average baseline systolic BP (SBP) than CC subjects (\u03b2\u00b1s.e.: 5.0\u00b12.3, P=0.033); and no associations of rs5517 with baseline BP (diastolic BP (DBP) and SBP) and BP responses, or rs5516 with baseline DBP and BP response were observed. In a haplotype-based association test for the KLK1 gene, the Haplo-special score analyses identified that haplotype AG was marginally associated with SBP response (specific score: 1.75 for P=0.08), but not with DBP response. We did not find any associations between haplotypes (GC and AC) and BP responses. The Haplo-GLM analyses showed that, compared with haplotype GC subjects, the subjects with haplotype AG had a marginally greater SBP response (adjusted \u03b2\u00b1s.e.: 1.81\u00b10.97, P=0.06), but DBP response did not differ. This study suggests that rs5516 in the KLK1 gene may be involved in the development of essential hypertension and in the regulation of SBP-lowering response to irbesartan in Chinese hypertensives.",

One of the enzymes of this pathway is the heterooctameric mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP), composed of four \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits. Mutations in MTP genes (HADHA and HADHB), both located on chromosome 2p23, cause MTP deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by decreased activity of MTP. The most common MTP mutation is long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency caused by the c.1528G>C (rs137852769, p.Glu510Gln) substitution in exon 15 of the HADHA gene.\n<b>Subjects/methods</b>: We analyzed the frequency of genetic variants in the HADHA gene in the adults of Kashubian origin from North Poland and compared this data in other Polish provinces.\n<b>Results</b>: We found a significantly higher frequency of HDHA c.1528G>C (rs137852769, p.Glu510Gln) carriers among Kashubians (1/57) compared to subjects from other regions of Poland (1/187).

                "text": "<b>Background</b>: rs2274911 (Pro91Ser, G > A) is a missense mutation located on the second exon of the GPRC6A gene. Increasing evidence revealed a significant association between the A allele of rs2274911 and male diseases, such as oligospermia, cryptorchidism, and prostate tumor. However, the function of rs2274911 in healthy males is unclear.\n<b>Subjects And Methods</b>: A total of 1742 healthy men were selected from the Fangchenggang Area Male Health and Examination Survey (FAMHES). The association between rs2274911 and phenotype was evaluated. The cell characteristics of rs2274911 mutation (mu), wild-type GPRC6A (WT), and RFP control in human embryonic kidney (293T) and human prostate cancer (PC3) cells were analyzed. RNA sequencing was performed on PC3 cells.\n<b>Results</b>: E2 and PSA serum levels increased with the accumulation of the A allele (E2: G vs. A, -0.029 [-0.050, -0.008], P < 0.01, P trend = 0.027; PSA: G vs. A, -0.040 [-0.079, 0.000], P < 0.05, P trend = 0.048). rs2274911 enhanced the proliferation and invasion ability of PC3 or 293T cells and activated the ERK pathway. The genes were identified as rs2274911 mu-affected genes through RNA sequential analysis of rs2274911 mu, GPRC6A WT, and RFP control of PC3 cells. Most of these genes were related to cancer development processes, cAMP, and the ERK cell signaling pathway.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: This project represents that rs2274911 is associated with E2 and PSA serum levels in Southern Chinese men. Rs2274991 mutation promotes 293T and PC3 cell proliferation in vitro. These results suggest that rs2274911 is a functional variant of GPRC6A.",

MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase) enzyme repairs temozolomide-induced DNA mutations and associates both with antitumour efficacy and myelosuppression. Many studies on the effects of MGMT gene-methylation on temozolomide's effects exist, but much fewer publications concerning MGMT variants were documented. A full sequencing of the MGMT gene was performed in a female glioblastoma patient, who developed pancytopenia following temozolomide treatment. Results indicated the presence of all the rs2308321 (I143 V), rs2308327 (K178R) and rs12917 (L84F) MGMT-variants, which were previously associated with temozolomide myelotoxicity. rs12917 (L84F) variant was reported as associating with lesser risk of gallbladder tumours, yet with higher risk of non-Hodgkin lymphomas related with exposure to chlorinated solvents or hair dyes. DNA repair proteins may exert diverging effects on DNA injuries caused by different chemicals and therefore exerting complex effects on myelotoxicity, antitumour activity and carcinogenesis.",

                "text": "Weight gain is one of the most serious adverse effects of atypical antipsychotic agents. Genetic factors influence the risk of an individual to gain weight. The objective of our study was to determine whether the LEPR Q223R polymorphism and the LEP promoter 2548G/A polymorphism are associated with obesity in a group of male and female patients using atypical antipsychotic drugs. A cross-sectional study design was used. The study population consisted of 200 patients aged between 18 and 65 years, diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, all of whom had been using an atypical antipsychotic for at least 3 months. The primary outcome measure was the presence of obesity. Determinants were the LEPR Q223R (rs1137101) polymorphism and the LEP promoter 2548G/A single nucleotide polymorphism ([SNP] rs7799039). Of the 200 included patients, 61 (31%) were obese. In females, the LEPR 223QR (adjusted odds ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.54) and LEPR 223RR (adjusted odds ratio, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.63) genotypes were associated with a lower risk of obesity. In males, this association was not found. In females, the average body weight was 13.6 kg more (95% CI, 1.11-26.1) in the LEPR 223QQ group compared with the LEPR 223RR group. No significant association was found between the LEP promoter 2548G/A polymorphism and obesity. Taken together, the results of our study show that the LEPR Q223R polymorphism may be associated with obesity in women with a psychotic disorder treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs and stress the importance of stratification for gender when investigating the role of variations of the LEP- and LEPR genes on the metabolic side effects of antipsychotic medications.",

Several reports from different ethnic groups showed that the polymorphisms of the CTLA4 gene have been associated with autoimmune diseases including SLE. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the +49 A/G polymorphism in South Indian SLE patients and its association with disease aetiology and serological markers. A total of 534 samples were genotyped for the +49 A/G polymorphism in exon 1 of the CTLA-4 gene through PCR-RFLP method. We found significant association of genotype and allele frequencies with +49 A/G polymorphism in SLE patients. The frequency of the +49 A/G polymorphism rs231775 'GG' genotype was significantly higher in patients with SLE (12.32%) than those in healthy control subjects (4.6%) (OR: 1.797; 95% CI 1.264-2.554; p=0.001). The frequency of mutant allele 'G' also found to be significantly higher in cases (36.01%) than controls (24.92%) (OR: 1.695, 95% CI: 1.298-2.214, p<0.001). We observed significant increase in serum TNF-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b1, IL-10 and IL-12 in SLE cases compared to controls. We also found a significant association of serum TNF-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b1, IL-10 and IL-12 with SLE phenotypes. In addition there was a significant increase in serum TNF-\u03b1 level in \"GG\" genotype SLE subjects suggesting that it might play a major role in the advancement of SLE disease.",

SNaPshot was used for genotyping six SNP sites of the XPD gene. Comparisons of the correlations between different genotypes in combination with smoking and the susceptibility to pancreatic cancer were performed. Individual pancreatic cancer risk in patients who carry mutant C alleles (AC, CC, and AC+CC) at rs13181 increased (p < 0.05). Taking non-smoking individuals who carry the AA genotype as a reference, and non-smoking individuals who carry mutant allele C (AC+CC), the risk of pancreatic cancer increased by 3.343 times in individuals who smoked \u2265 20 cigarettes daily, 3.309 times in individuals who smoked \u2265 14 packs per year, 5.011 times in individuals who smoked \u2265 24 packs per year, and 4.013 times in the individuals who smoked \u2265 37 packs per year (P < 0.05). In addition, haplotype analysis revealed that haplotype AGG, which comprised rs13181, rs3916874 and rs238415, was associated with a 1.401-fold increase in pancreatic cancer risk (p < 0.05). We conclude that the polymorphism of XPD Lys751Gln (rs13181) in combination with smoking contributes to increased risk of pancreatic cancer in the Chinese Han population. Haplotype AGG might be a susceptibility haplotype for pancreatic cancer.",

Here we show that a SNP, 538G --> A (rs17822931), in the ABCC11 gene is responsible for determination of earwax type. The AA genotype corresponds to dry earwax, and GA and GG to wet type. A 27-bp deletion in ABCC11 exon 29 was also found in a few individuals of Asian ancestry. A functional assay demonstrated that cells with allele A show a lower excretory activity for cGMP than those with allele G. The allele A frequency shows a north-south and east-west downward geographical gradient; worldwide, it is highest in Chinese and Koreans, and a common dry-type haplotype is retained among various ethnic populations. These suggest that the allele A arose in northeast Asia and thereafter spread through the world. The 538G --> A SNP is the first example of DNA polymorphism determining a visible genetic trait.",

However, genetic association studies of the BDNF gene with AD have produced equivocal results.

For each of these findings, the pattern was similar: valine/valine individuals in late life were susceptible, and in early adult life, methionine allele carriers demonstrated susceptibility.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The BDNF gene confers risk in an age-dependent manner on the brain structures and cognitive functions that are consistent with the neural circuitry vulnerable in the earliest stages of AD. Our novel findings provide convergent evidence in vivo for a BDNF genetic mechanism of susceptibility in an intermediate phenotype related to AD.",

We investigated the influence of IL17A and IL23R SNPs on the risk of developing multiple myeloma (MM) and its clinical features. We obtained genomic DNA from 120 patients with MM and 201 healthy controls and detected IL17A -197 G/A (rs2275913) and IL23R H3Q (rs1884444) genotypes using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of IL17A -197 G/A and IL23R H3Q between the controls and patients with MM. Compared with the GG and GA genotypes, the IL17A AA genotype was significantly associated with lower hemoglobin levels. The IL23R HH genotype was significantly associated with higher frequency of bone lesions and plasmacytoma than the HQ and QQ genotypes. We observed significant differences in overall survival (OS) between patients treated with thalidomide and/or bortezomib and those treated conventionally. Therefore, we also examined the effect of IL17A and IL23R polymorphisms on the clinical variables and OS in patients treated with thalidomide and/or bortezomib. We observed that the IL23R HH genotype was significantly associated with poor survival compared with the QH and HH genotypes in these patients. Our findings indicate that IL17A -197 G/A and IL23R H3Q are not associated with susceptibility to MM. However, IL-17 and IL-23R polymorphisms may affect severity, bone lesions, and extra-medullary disease in patients with MM. Moreover, IL23R polymorphisms may contribute to poor prognosis in patients with MM treated with thalidomide and/or bortezomib.",

The allele and genotype frequency distributions of TP53 R72P (rs1042522) polymorphism and NFKB1 2592 + 58T > A (rs4648110) polymorphism were characterized in groups of men and women of 21-109 years in the given research. No statistically significant distinctions in allele and genotype frequencies between long-livers, old people and other age groups were revealed. On the basis of logistic regression analysis results it is obviously possible to make the conclusion that polymorphism R72P of TP53 gene and polymorphism 2592 + 58T > A of NFKB1 genes is associated with the age mainly throughout elderly and senile ranges of years. Relative chances to achieve the age of 80-90 years are higher in carriers of TP53*R/*R and NFKB1*A/*A genotypes. It is also possible to believe that TP53 and NFKB1 genes are frailty genes, instead of longevity ones.",

The alpha-adrenergic receptors inhibit lipolysis in the adipose tissue and are involved in weight gain regulation. Moreover, two previous studies indicated an association with antipsychotic-induced weight gain with the same polymorphism in Asian populations.\n<b>Materials & Methods</b>: We analyzed a relatively large (n=129) and well-characterized group of patients and monitored them for a period of 6-14 weeks. Our refined sample consisted of 60 European-Americans and 39 African-Americans on clozapine or olanzapine, prospectively.\n<b>Results</b>: In European-Americans, we observed a significant difference in weight gain across the genotypic categories (p=0.046). The carriers of the C allele gained more weight compared with the subjects homozygous for the GG allele (CC + CG vs GG; 3.73 +/- 4.13 kg vs 0.23 +/- 2.92 kg; p=0.013). We did not find a significant association in African-Americans, although the sample size was probably too small.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Our observations suggest a possible role of ADRA2A polymorphisms in clozapine-/olanzpaine-induced weight gain in subjects of European descent.",

Small-molecule stimulation of PPARgamma is investigated for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The common PPARgamma Pro12Ala variant has functional and prognostic consequences. A protective effect of the 12Ala-allele carriership on diabetes and myocardial infarction in healthy populations has been suggested. The relevance of this pathway also needs exploration in patients with manifest vascular disease. We investigated the effects of carriership of the Pro12Ala variant on angiographic and cardiovascular event outcomes in male patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).\n<b>Research Design And Methods</b>: The Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) cohort was genotyped for the Pro12Ala variant (rs1801282). Ten-year follow-up was derived from nation-wide registries, and risks were estimated using proportional hazards. Quantitative coronary angiography measurements were obtained and relations with genotype estimated using a generalized linear model.\n<b>Results</b>: Genotypes ascertained (n = 679) comprised 540 (80%) Pro/Pro, 126 (19%) Pro/Ala, and 13 (2%) Ala/Ala subjects. The 12Ala allele was associated with less extensive focal (P = 0.001) and diffuse (P = 0.002) atherosclerosis and lower 10-year cardiovascular risk. Hazard ratios were 0.10 (95% CI 0.01-0.70, P = 0.02) for ischemic heart disease and 0.24 (0.08-0.74, P = 0.013) for vascular death, per each added copy of 12Ala, respectively.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Carriers of the 12Ala allele of PPARgamma have less widespread CAD and are considerably protected against 10-year (cardio)vascular morbidity and mortality. These long-term findings in patients with manifest CAD support an important role of PPARgamma in determining vascular risk.",

Peripheral venous blood was obtained from 322 Yugur, 399 Tibetan, and 120 Han healthy people. The DNA were then extracted. vWF gene A1381T and -1793G/C polymorphisms were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and sequenced when it was necessary. The vWF:Ag level in plasma was determined by ELISA. The results showed that the genotype distribution of vWF gene at both A1381T and -1793G/C loci in Yugur, Tibetan and Han nationalities was different with statistically significance (P < 0.05). GG genotype of A1381T locus accounted for 69.9% in Yugur nationality, which was much higher than 56.6% and 53.3% in Tibetan and Han nationalities respectively(P < 0.01); AA genotype of A1381T locus expressed a low level of vWF in plasma. For the -1793G/C locus, the proportion of CG genotype in Yugur was much higher than that in Han, CC genotype expressed a high level of vWF in plasma. The plasma vWF levels with different nationalities and the polymorphism of vWF gene were significantly different. It is concluded that the polymorphisms of vWF gene at both A1381T and -1793G/C loci in Yugur, Tibetan and Han are significantly different; the polymorphism of vWF gene influences the plasma vWF level; the plasma vWF levels in Yugur and Tibetan are significantly higher than that in Han, which may be associated with the living environment and habits.",

                "text": "Outcome predictors of biologic therapeutic drugs like TNF inhibitors are of interest since side effects like serious infections or malignancy cannot be completely ruled out. Response rates are heterogeneous. The present study addressed the question whether in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) interleukin-10 (IL-10) promoter genotypes with potential relevance for IL-10 production capacity are associated with response to long-term treatment with etanercept. Caucasian RA patients that, according to the EULAR criteria, responded well (n = 25), moderately (n = 17) or not (n = 8) to etanercept therapy (median 36 months, range 4-52), and 160 matched controls were genotyped for the IL-10 promoter SNPs -2849 G>A (rs6703630), -1082 G>A (rs1800896), -819 C>T (rs1800871) and -592 C>A (rs1800872). Haplotypes were reconstructed via mathematic model and tested for associations with disease susceptibility and therapy response. We identified the four predominant haplotypes AGCC, GATA, GGCC, and GACC in almost equal distribution. Patients that responded well carried the putative IL-10 low producer allele -2849 A or the haplotypes AGCC and GATA (RR 2.1 and 4.0, respectively; 95% CI 1.1-4.0 and 1.1-14.8), whereas an unfavourable response was associated with carriage of the putative high producer haplotype GGCC (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3). No significant associations of alleles or haplotypes with disease susceptibility were observed. In RA, a low IL-10 production which is genetically determined rather by haplotypes than by SNPs may favour the response to etanercept treatment. Iatrogenic blockade of TNF may reveal proinflammatory effects of its endogeneous antagonist IL-10. Further studies are needed to correlate these genetic findings to direct cytokine measurements.",

Standardized questionnaire and physical examination were performed. Among them there 451 EH patients (EH group) and 478 normotensive (NT) subjects (NT group) according to Guidelines of Prevention and Control for Hypertension in 2005. All the exons and promoter regions of prostasin gene were sequenced in 94 EH patients. Representative variations (297A>C, 2827C>T, and E342K) were genotyped using TaqMan polymerase chain reaction method in all 938 subjects. The frequencies of genotypes were compared between the EH and NT groups.\n<b>Results</b>: Ten variations were found as follows: -36G>C, -27C>T, 78G>A, 81G>C (rs8049043), 297A>C, 350C>T, 351A>C, 2827C>T, 3482G>A (E342K), and 3783A>G. E342K and 2827C>T were successfully genotyped. E342K mutation was identified in only one hypertensive patient. CC, CT, and TT genotypes existed in 2827C>T polymorphism. The frequencies of CC, CT, and TT were 81.0%, 17.3, and 1.7% in EH group and 80.3%, 18.9%, and 0.8% in NT group, respectively. The frequencies of C and T alleles were 89.6% and 10.4% in EH group and 89.8% and 10.2% in NT group, respectively. The distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies were not significantly different between these two groups (chi2=2.048, P=0.353 and chi2=0.001, P=0.973). Blood pressure was not significantly among subjects with these three genotypes (P>0.05).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The EH of Xinjiang Kazakhs is not associated with 2827C>T polymorphism in the prostasin gene. E342K mutation in the prostasin gene may contribute partly to the hypertensive phenotype in this population.",

We have also aimed to screen the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism effect on structural and functional properties of the hOGG1 protein using in silico tools. We have analyzed four SNPs of hOGG1 gene among Saudi breast cancer patients along with healthy controls. Genotypes were screened using TaqMan SNP genotype analysis method. Experimental data was analyzed using Chi-square, t test and logistic regression analysis using SPSS software (v.16). In silco analysis was conducted using discovery studio and HOPE program. Genotypic analysis showed that hOGG1 rs1052133 (Ser326Cys) is significantly associated with breast cancer samples in Saudi population, however rs293795 (T >C), rs2072668 (C>G) and rs2075747 (G >A) did not show any association with breast cancer. The hOGG1 SNP rs1052133 (Ser326Cys) minor allele T showed a significant association with breast cancer samples (OR = 1.78, \u03c72 = 7.86, p = 0.02024). In silico structural analysis was carried out to compare the wild type (Ser326) and mutant (Cys326) protein structures. The structural prediction studies revealed that Ser326Cys variant may destabilize the protein structure and it may disturb the hOGG1 function. Taken together this is the first In silico study report to confirm Ser326Cys variant effect on structural and functional properties of hOGG1 gene and Ser326Cys role in breast cancer susceptibility in Saudi population.",

                "text": "<b>Background</b>: The effect of risperidone treatment in patients with schizophrenia varies according to the dopamine receptor genes. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between genes of the dopamine receptors (D1, D2, and D3) and the effect of risperidone treatment.\n<b>Methods</b>: Three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were searched for relevant cohort or case-control studies published before 9 May 2018. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the relationship between the dopamine receptors D1, D2, and D3 (DRD1, 2, and 3) and the effect of risperidone treatment. The summary odds ratio (OR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) in a random-effects model were used to measure these relationships.\n<b>Results</b>: Twelve studies involving 24 SNPs were included. DRD2 (Ser311Cys, rs1801028 Ser/Ser) significantly lowered the improvement rate (determined by the PANSS score) unlike Ser/Cys (WMD: -11.58, 95% CI: -17.35 to -5.18). For Asian patients, A241G (rs1799978) AA carriers showed greater improvement after risperidone therapy (P < 0.05). The polymorphisms of 141C Ins/Del (rs1799732), T939C (rs6275), rs6277, and TaqID (rs1800498) may also influence the treatment effect. TaqIA (rs1800497) and TaqIB (rs17294542) were not associated with the rate of response to risperidone. DRD3 was not associated with an improvement in the PANSS total score; however, Ser9Gly might be related to a change in negative symptoms. No significant effect of DRD1 (rs5326, rs4867798, rs4532, and rs11749676) was found.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our result supported the hypothesis that DRD2 affected risperidone treatment. DRD1 had no significant effect on the response to risperidone, whereas DRD3 might be associated with an improvement in negative symptoms. Larger observational studies are warranted to verify these findings and identify other genetic factors involved.",

Odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were estimated by logistic regression models.\n<b>Results</b>: The PXR A7635G variant, the PPAR\u03b3 Pro12Ala and LXR T-rs2695121-C homozygous variant genotypes were associated with risk of UC (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.03-1.66, P = 0.03, OR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.04-5.08, P = 0.04, and OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.00-1.98, P = 0.05, respectively) compared to the corresponding homozygous wild-type genotypes. Among never smokers, PXR A7635G and the LXR T-rs1405655-C and T-rs2695121-C variant genotypes were associated with risk of IBD (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05-1.91, P = 0.02, OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.21-2.20, P = 0.001, and OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.36-2.99, P = 0.0005, respectively) compared to the respective homozygous variant genotypes. PXR A7635G (rs6785049) variant genotype was associated with a higher risk of UC diagnosis before the age of 40 years and with a higher risk of extensive disease (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03-1.75 and OR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.24-5.03, respectively).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Common PXR and LXR polymorphisms may contribute to risk of IBD, especially among never smokers.",

Whether this interaction can be extrapolated to food-based sources of SFAs, specifically dairy foods, is unexplored. Cross-sectional analyses were performed in 2 U.S. population-based samples. We evaluated interactions between dairy foods and APOA2 -265T > C (rs5082) for BMI in the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (n = 955) and tested for replication in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study (n = 1116). Dairy products were evaluated as total dairy, higher-fat dairy (>1%), and low-fat dairy (\u2264 1%) in servings per day, dichotomized into high and low based on each population median and also as continuous variables. We identified a statistically significant interaction between the APOA2 -265T > C variant and higher-fat dairy food intake in the Boston Puerto Ricans (P-interaction = 0.028) and replicated this relation in the GOLDN study (P-interaction = 0.001). In both groups, individuals with the previously demonstrated SFA-sensitive genotype (CC) who consumed a greater amount of higher-fat dairy foods had greater BMI (P = 0.013 in Boston Puerto Ricans; P = 0.0007 in GOLDN women) compared with those consuming less of the higher-fat dairy foods. The results expand the understanding of the metabolic influence of dairy products, an important food group for which variable relations to body weight may be in part genetically based. Moreover, these findings suggest that other strongly demonstrated gene-nutrient relations might be investigated through appropriate food-based, translatable avenues and may be relevant to dietary management of obesity.",

The categorization of homocysteine concentrations into tertiles revealed significant differences in serum concentrations of folate, vitamin B12 and HDL, waist circumference and intake of total and saturated fat among the tertiles. The presence of variant alleles regarding the MTHFR C677T polymorphism interfered with vitamin B6 and ox-LDL cholesterol concentrations. There was a trend for higher waist circumference values in T carriers (C677T), but not in C carriers (A1298C).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The MTHFR C677T allele was associated with higher plasma vitamin B6 and ox-LDL compared to the CC genotype.",

                "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in the people of over 65. Majority of PD is sporadic, which is caused by interaction of genetic and environmental factors. To date, genetic causes and underlying molecular mechanisms for sporadic PD remain largely unknown. Autophagy is a conserved cellular degradative process, consisting of macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) and CMA are involved in the degradation of alpha-synuclein, a critical protein in the PD pathogenesis. Previous studies with brain tissues and leukocytes have shown that the expression levels of lysosome-associated membrane-2 (LAMP-2) gene are significantly decreased in PD patients. In this study, we genetically and functionally analyze the promoter region of LAMP-2 gene in sporadic PD patients. Two novel sequence variants and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. The heterozygous variant, g.4127A>C, which was only found in one female PD patient, significantly reduced the transcriptional activities of LAMP-2 gene promoter. The hemizygous variant, g.5038G>A, which was only found in one male control, enhanced the transcriptional activities of LAMP-2 gene promoter. No significant difference in frequencies of the SNPs, rs42900 (g.4569A>C) and rs28603270 (g.4760T>G), was observed between PD patients and controls. Collectively, the sequence variants within the LAMP-2 gene promoter may be linked to the PD onset by changing LAMP-2 protein levels and impairing autophagy and CMA activities.",

In order to clarify the significance of TERT promoter SNPs and mutations, including rs2853669 (-245T>C), C228T, and C250T, we analyzed 59 FTA patients and 19 FTC patients. Rs2853669 was found in 67.8% (40/59) and 57.9% (11/19) of FTAs and FTCs, respectively, and homozygous rs2853669 (CC) was more frequently found in FTC than in FTA. Furthermore, in FTA, rs2853669 was significantly associated with tumor size greater than 2.0 cm (P < 0.05). C228T was found in 5.1% and 36.8% of FTAs and FTCs, respectively. Frequencies of rs2853669 or/and C228T mutation were 71.2% in FTAs and 73.7%, in FTCs, and were significantly associated with larger tumor sizes in FTAs (P < 0.05).

Here, we aimed to assess the role of the coding rs662 (Q192R) SNP as a modifier of ALS phenotype.\n<b>Materials And Methods</b>: We genotyped a cohort of 409 patients diagnosed with ALS at our Center between 2002 and 2009 (269 males and 140 females; mean age at onset, 58.3 \u00b1 37.5 years).\n<b>Results</b>: We found PON1 to be a disease modifier gene in ALS, with the minor allele G associated both with bulbar onset (30.9% vs. 24.6%, p = 0.013) and independently with reduced survival (OR = 1.38, p = 0.012) under a dominant model. No association was found with gender or age at onset.\n<b>Discussion</b>: As this SNP is known to modify the detoxifying activity of paraxonase 1 with respect to different substrates as well as other activities of the protein, we hypothesize that the identified association might reflect specific motor neuron vulnerability to certain exogenous toxic substances metabolized less efficiently by the 192R alloenzyme, or to detrimental endogenous pathophysiological processes such as oxidative stress. Further exploration of this possible metabolic susceptibility could deepen our knowledge of ALS pathomechanisms.",

The nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2274407 (G912T; K304N) is located in the 3' splice acceptor site of exon 8 of ABCC4 pre-mRNA. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of rs2274407 in childhood ALL and its possible functional effect on MRP4.\n<b>Methods</b>: ABCC4 G912T SNP was genotyped in 145 Iranian Philadelphia-negative (Ph<sup>-</sup>) children with ALL using modified tetra-primer ARMS PCR and evaluated for possible association with 3-year disease-free survival (3DFS). In addition, functional impact of rs2274407 on the MRP4 activity and possible post-transcriptional modifications were bioinformatically and experimentally studied.\n<b>Results</b>: ABCC4 912T allele carriers (G/T and T/T genotypes) are associated with worse 3DFS in Pre-B cell ALL [P = 0.00019, OR (95% CI) = 13.17 (2.55-68.11)]. In addition, computational studies showed that K304N alteration has no impact on the MRP4 activity. However, it may disrupt the normal splicing process of ABCC4 pre-mRNA.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: To date, this is the first study that shows the potential functional impact of rs2274407 SNP on the aberrant splicing of ABCC4 mRNA. We also demonstrated a robust association between G912T and pediatric ALL negative outcome, which may be explained by the novel computational studies performed in this study.",

Data were analyzed between March 2017 and September 2018.\n<b>Main Outcomes And Measures</b>: Minor alleles genome-wide and in 95 genes previously associated with AD, AD-related traits, or other dementias were tabulated and filtered for predicted functional impact and occurrence in participants with AD but not controls. Support for several findings was sought in a whole-exome sequencing data set comprising 19 affected relative pairs from Utah high-risk pedigrees and whole-genome sequencing data sets from the ADSP and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.\n<b>Results</b>: Among 5617 participants with AD (3202 [57.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 76.4 [9.3] years) and 4594 controls (2719 [59.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 86.5 [4.5] years), a total of 24 variants with moderate or high functional impact from 19 genes were observed in 10 or more participants with AD but not in controls. These variants included a missense mutation (rs149307620 [p.A284T], n = 10) in NOTCH3, a gene in which coding mutations are associated with cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), that was also identified in 1 participant with AD and 1 participant with mild cognitive impairment in the whole genome sequencing data sets. Four participants with AD carried the TREM2 rs104894002 (p.Q33X) high-impact mutation that, in homozygous form, causes Nasu-Hakola disease, a rare disorder characterized by early-onset dementia and multifocal bone cysts, suggesting an intermediate inheritance model for the mutation. Compared with controls, participants with AD had a significantly higher burden of deleterious rare coding variants in dementia-associated genes (2314 vs 3354 cumulative variants, respectively; P = .006).\n<b>Conclusions And Relevance</b>: Different mutations in the same gene or variable dose of a mutation may be associated with result in distinct dementias. These findings suggest that minor differences in the structure or amount of protein may be associated with in different clinical outcomes. Understanding these genotype-phenotype associations may provide further insight into the pathogenic nature of the mutations, as well as offer clues for developing new therapeutic targets.",

We tested whether genetically lowered mEH activity affects risk of developing cancer in the general population.\n<b>Methods</b>: We genotyped 47,089 individuals from the Danish general population for the Tyr113His and His139Arg polymorphisms in the EPHX1 gene and divided them into groups with predicted fast, intermediate, and slow mEH activity. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we calculated HRs for 26 individual cancer diagnoses and for groups of any cancer, tobacco-related cancers, estrogen-related female cancers, and other cancers.\n<b>Results</b>: Of the 47,089 individuals, 7,590 experienced a cancer event, and of these, 1,466 were tobacco-related. After multifactorial adjustment, the HRs (95% CI) for tobacco-related cancer were 1.1 (0.8-1.5) and 1.5 (1.1-2.0) in individuals with intermediate and slow mEH activity versus individuals with the fast phenotype (P(trend) = 0.003). The corresponding HRs among ever-smokers were 1.1 (0.8-1.5) and 1.5 (1.1-2.0; P(trend) = 0.003), whereas HRs among never-smokers did not differ from 1.0.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our results indicate that genetically lowered mEH activity is associated with increased risk of developing tobacco-related cancer among smokers in the general population; however, additional studies are needed to confirm our findings.\n<b>Impact</b>: To our knowledge, this is the largest study to investigate the association of mEH phenotype and genotype with tobacco-related cancers combined in the general population.",

Deficits in oxidative phosphorylation functioning have been reported for schizophrenia, but efforts in the identification of genetic markers within the mitochondrial DNA that predispose to schizophrenia have been limited. We genotyped a set of mitochondrial SNPs using Illumina HumanExome arrays and tested for association in the Swedish schizophrenia sample (N> 10,000). We developed a novel approach for mitochondrial DNA imputation in order to increase the number of common SNPs available for association analysis. The most significant findings were for the mitochondrial SNPs C15452A (GRCh38.p10; rs527236209; p = 0.007; gene MT-CYB; defining haplogroup JT); A11251G (rs869096886; p = 0.007; gene MT-ND4; defining haplogroup JT), and T4216C (rs1599988; p = 0.008, gene MT-ND1, defining haplogroup R2'JT). We also conducted rare variant burden analyses and obtained a p-value of 0.007. For multimarker haplotypes analysis, the most significant finding was for the J group (OR: 0.86, p = 0.02). We conducted the largest association study of mitochondrial DNA variants and schizophrenia but did not find an association that survived multiple testing correction. Analysis of a larger sample is required and will allow a better understanding of the role of mitochondria in schizophrenia.",

The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is involved in the degradation of catecholamines and a functional polymorphism (Val158Met) has been suggested to influence enzyme activity. In this study we hypothesize that genetic variation in the COMT gene contributes to increased risk for cocaine dependence. Cocaine-dependent individuals (n=330) and screened unaffected normal controls (n=255) were genotyped for three SNPs in the COMT gene (rs737865, rs4680 (Val158Met), rs165599). All cases and controls were of African descent. Genotype and allele frequencies differed significantly for the Val158Met polymorphism between cases (f(Met)=35%) and controls (f(Met)=27%) (p=0.004; corrected p=0.014; OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.12-1.86). Haplotype analysis showed a significant association for a two-marker haplotype rs737865-Val158Met (p=0.005). Results suggest that variation in COMT increases risk for cocaine dependence. The low enzyme activity 158Met allele or haplotypes containing this variant might have functional effects on dopamine-derived reward processes and cortical functions resulting in increased susceptibility for cocaine dependence. Additional studies are required to elucidate the role of COMT in the pathophysiology of substance use disorders.",

                "text": "Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 was originally discovered in a large Scottish family with abnormally high rates of severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. An accumulating body of evidence from genetic, postmortem, and animal data supports a role for DISC1 in different forms of mental illness. DISC1 may play an important role in determining structure and function of several brain regions. One brain region of particular importance for several mental disorders is the striatum, and DISC1 mutant mice have demonstrated an increase in dopamine (D2) receptors in this structure. However, association between DISC1 functional polymorphisms and striatal structure have not been examined in humans. We, therefore hypothesized that there would be a relationship between human striatal volume and DISC1 genotype, specifically in the Leu607Phe (rs6675281) and Ser704Cys (rs821618) single nucleotide polymorphisms. We tested our hypothesis by automatically identifying the striatum in 54 healthy volunteers recruited for this study. We also performed an exploratory analysis of cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and structure volume. Our results demonstrate that Phe allele carriers have larger striatal volume bilaterally (left striatum: p = 0.017; right striatum: p = 0.016). From the exploratory analyses we found that the Phe carriers also had larger left hemisphere volumes (p = 0.0074) and right occipital lobe surface area (p = 0.014) compared to LeuLeu homozygotes. However, these exploratory findings do not survive a conservative correction for multiple comparisons. Our findings demonstrate that a functional DISC1 variant influences striatal volumes. Taken together with animal data that this gene influences D2 receptor levels in striatum, a key risk pathway for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may be conferred via DISC1's effects on the striatum.",

The immunological role of anti-inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin 10 (IL10), has been well-documented in parasite infections and considered as a key regulatory cytokine for VL. Although VL patients in India display high level of IL10 in blood serum, no genetic study has been conducted to assess the VL susceptibility / resistance. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the role of IL10 variations in Indian VL; and to estimate the distribution of disease associated allele in diverse Indian populations.\n<b>Methodology</b>: All the exons and exon-intron boundaries of IL10 were sequenced in 184 VL patients along with 172 ethnically matched controls from VL endemic region of India.\n<b>Result And Discussion</b>: Our analysis revealed four variations; rs1518111 (2195 A>G, intron), rs1554286 (2607 C>T, intron), rs3024496 (4976 T>C, 3' UTR) and rs3024498 (5311 A>G, 3' UTR). Of these, a variant g.5311A is significantly associated with VL (\u03c72=18.87; p =0.00001). In silico approaches have shown that a putative micro RNA binding site (miR-4321) is lost in rs3024498 mRNA. Further, analysis of the above four variations in 1138 individuals from 34 ethnic populations, representing different social and linguistic groups who are inhabited in different geographical regions of India, showed variable frequency. Interestingly, we have found, majority of the tribal populations have low frequency of VL ('A' of rs3024498); and high frequency of leprosy ('T' of rs1554286), and Behcet's ('A' of rs1518111) associated alleles, whereas these were vice versa in castes. Our findings suggest that majority of tribal populations of India carry the protected / less severe allele against VL, while risk / more severe allele for leprosy and Behcet's disease. This study has potential implications in counseling and management of VL and other infectious diseases.",

                "text": "Engagement of integrins by the extracellular matrix initiates signaling cascades that drive a variety of cellular functions, including neuronal migration and axonal pathfinding in the brain. Multiple lines of evidence link the <i>ITGB3</i> gene encoding the integrin \u03b23 subunit with the serotonin (5-HT) system, likely via its modulation of the 5-HT transporter (SERT). The <i>ITGB3</i> coding polymorphism Leu33Pro (rs5918, Pl<sup>A2</sup>) produces hyperactive \u03b1v\u03b23 receptors that influence whole-blood 5-HT levels and may influence the risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a phenome-wide scan of psychiatric diagnoses, we found significant, male-specific associations between the Pro33 allele and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and ASDs. Here, we used knock-in (KI) mice expressing an <i>Itgb3</i> variant that phenocopies the human Pro33 variant to elucidate the consequences of constitutively enhanced \u03b1v\u03b23 signaling to the 5-HT system in the brain. KI mice displayed deficits in multiple behaviors, including anxiety, repetitive, and social behaviors. Anatomical studies revealed a significant decrease in 5-HT synapses in the midbrain, accompanied by decreases in SERT activity and reduced localization of SERTs to integrin adhesion complexes in synapses of KI mice. Inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) rescued SERT function in synapses of KI mice, demonstrating that constitutive active FAK signaling downstream of the Pro32Pro33 integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 suppresses SERT activity. Our studies identify a complex regulation of 5-HT homeostasis and behaviors by integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, revealing an important role for integrins in modulating risk for neuropsychiatric disorders.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The integrin \u03b23 Leu33Pro coding polymorphism has been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) within a subgroup of patients with elevated blood 5-HT levels, linking integrin \u03b23, 5-HT, and ASD risk. We capitalized on these interactions to demonstrate that the Pro33 coding variation in the murine integrin \u03b23 recapitulates the sex-dependent neurochemical and behavioral attributes of ASD. Using state-of-the-art techniques, we show that presynaptic 5-HT function is altered in these mice, and that the localization of 5-HT transporters to specific compartments within the synapse, disrupted by the integrin \u03b23 Pro33 mutation, is critical for appropriate reuptake of 5-HT. Our studies provide fundamental insight into the genetic network regulating 5-HT neurotransmission in the CNS that is also associated with ASD risk.",

Several different base editor constructs (BE3, SaBE3, SaKKH-BE3, VQR-BE3, and Target-AID) and their respective single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes targeting either the pathogenic risk variant allele in the <i>CFH</i> locus or the <i>LacZ</i> gene, as a negative control, were evaluated head-to-head for the incidence of a cytosine-to-thymine nucleotide correction. The base editor construct that showed appreciable editing activity was selected for further assessment in which the base-edited region was subjected to next-generation deep sequencing to quantify on-target and off-target editing efficacy.\n<b>Results</b>: The tandem use of the Target-AID base editor and its respective sgRNA demonstrated a base editing efficiency of facilitating a cytosine-to-thymine nucleotide correction in 21.5% of the total sequencing reads. Additionally, the incidence of insertions and deletions (indels) was detected in only 0.15% of the sequencing reads with virtually no off-target effects evident across the top 11 predicted off-target sites containing at least one cytosine in the activity window (n = 3, pooled amplicons).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: CRISPR-mediated base editing can be used to facilitate a permanent and stably inherited cytosine-to-thymine nucleotide correction of the rs1061170 SNP in the <i>CFH</i> gene with minimal off-target effects.",

                "text": "There is growing interest in understanding the neurobiological foundations of attention. To examine whether attentional processes in a change detection task are modulated by dopamine signalling, we investigated the influence of two polymorphisms, i.e. Val158Met (rs4680) in the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) and a variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism (VNTR, rs28363170) in the dopamine transporter (DAT1). The COMT Met allele, which results in lower enzyme activity and therefore probably enhanced PFC dopamine signalling, was significantly associated with task-performance and modulated executive control: Homozygous Met/Met allele carriers had difficulties when performing a change detection task, particularly showing the greatest difficulties in case cognitive and behavioural flexibility was necessary and the required reaction was not part of the subject's primary task set. Contrary, no difference between the two genotype groups were evident, when an attentional conflict emerged and attentional control was needed for adequate responding. No association with variation in DAT1 was observed. The results indicate a dissociation of the prefrontal and striatal dopamine system for attentional control and behavioural flexibility in a change detection task: While prefrontal dopamine turnover seems to modulate performance, putatively via difficulties in set shifting leading to behavioural inflexibility in COMT Met allele carriers, striatal dopamine turnover seems less important in this regard. With respect to other studies examining mechanisms of attentional functions in different paradigms, the results suggest that behavioural flexibility and attentional control as two executive subprocesses are differentially influenced by genetic polymorphisms within the dopaminergic system.

Statistically significant relationship was observed between <i>IL-6</i> -174G>C polymorphism and cervical cancer risk (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.40-0.94 for GG vs. CC, and OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64-0.93 for G vs. C). Moreover, the significant association was found among Asians (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.29-0.75 for GG vs. CC, and OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.57-0.89 for G vs. C); hospital-based subgroup (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.38-0.72 for GG vs. CC, and OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61-0.87 for G vs. C); and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium \u22640.05 (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.37-0.86 for GG vs. GC, and OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47-0.93 for G vs. C). This meta-analysis showed the evidence that the <i>IL-6</i> -174G>C polymorphism was a low-penetrance susceptibility variant for cervical cancer. Further large-scale case-control studies are needed to confirm these results.",

Nevertheless its contribution in the South-American population is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of PALB2 mutations in the Chilean population.\n<b>Methods</b>: 100 Chilean BRCA1/2-negatives familial BC cases were included for the PALB2 mutation analysis. We use conformational sensitive gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing. Using a case-control design, we studied the identified variants in 436 BC cases and 809 controls to evaluate their possible association with BC risk.\n<b>Results</b>: No pathogenic mutations were detected. We identified three variants, the variant c.1861C > A not previously described was found in one of the 436 cases and none of the 809 controls. The bioinformatic analyses indicate that this variant probably is not pathogenic. PALB2 c.1676A > G (rs152451A/G) and c.2993C > T (rs45551636C/T) variants were significantly associated with increased BC risk only in cases with a strong family history of BC (OR = 1.9 [CI 95% 1.3-2.8] p < 0.01 and OR = 3.3 [CI 95% 1.4-7.3] p < 0.01, respectively). The rs152451A/G-rs45551636C/T composite genotype produce increase of the BC risk in cases with a strong family history of BC (OR = 3.6 [CI 95% 1.7-8.0] p = 0.003). The rs152451-G/rs45551636-C and rs152451-G/rs45551636-T haplotypes were associated with an increased BC risk only in cases with a strong family history of BC (OR = 1.6 [CI 95% 1.0-2.5] p = 0.05 and OR = 3.7 [CI 95% 1.8-7.5] p < 0.001, respectively).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Our results suggest that PALB2 c.1676A > G and c.2993C > T play roles in BC risk in women with a strong family history of BC.",

The A5 apolipoprotein, which is associated with the synthesis and removal of triglycerides (TG), is encoded by the APOA5 gene. One of the polymorphisms of this gene that has been the focus of a large number of studies, and which appears to be associated with increased TG, is S19W (rs 3135506). In this study, we examined the influence of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on TG levels of a sample of southern Brazilians.\n<b>Methods And Results</b>: Samples obtained from 567 people of European descent were genotyped; interactions between this variant and anthropometric variables were analyzed, and the effects of lifestyle, sex, menopause, and variations of the APOE gene were evaluated. We found that the 19W allele is associated with increased TG (p = 0.025) and that this influence was modulated by sex (p = 0.003), menopause (p = 0.022) and the presence of the E*4 allele (p = 0.027).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Our data showed, for the first time, the importance and magnitude of the influence of the S19W variant in a southern Brazilian population.",

In this study, TNF-\u03b1 and TNFRSF1A genotypes were retrospectively evaluated in terms of predicting clinical response, long-term survival, and severe acute toxicities in 46 male Japanese ESCC patients treated with definitive 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT).\n<b>Methods</b>: A course consisted of the continuous infusion of 5-FU at 400 mg/m(2)/day for days 1-5 and 8-12, the infusion of CDDP at 40 mg/m(2)/day on days 1 and 8, and radiation at 2 Gy/day on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19, with a second course being repeated after a 2-week interval. The TNF-\u03b1 -1031T>C (rs1799964), -863C>A (rs1800630), -857C>T (rs1799724), -308G>A (rs1800629), -238G>A (rs361525), TNFRSF1A -609G>T (rs4149570), and 36A>G (rs767455) genotypes were evaluated.\n<b>Results</b>: The TNF-\u03b1 -857C>T genotype was found to be predictive of clinical response, i.e., complete response or not (P = 0.010, Fisher's exact test), but had no effect on long-term survival (CC(-857) vs. CT(-857) + TT(-857), P = 0.072, Fisher's exact test, P = 0.070, Log-rank test).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The TNF-\u03b1 -857C>T genotype was found to be predictive of clinical response and was more likely to predict long-term survival in Japanese ESCC patients receiving definitive 5-FU/CDDP-based CRT. Further clinical investigations with a larger number of patients or experiments in vitro should be performed to assess the predictive value of this genotype following CRT.",

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the relationships.\n<b>Methods</b>: We retrieved the relevant articles from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Fourteen studies with 1618 gastric and colorectal cancer patients were included. Primary outcomes included response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated. All analyses were performed using the Stata software version 11.0 and Review Manager (v5.0).\n<b>Results</b>: In the dominant model, the A allele of XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism was associated with reduced RR to platinum-based chemotherapy in all gastric and colorectal cancer patients (A/G + A/A vs G/G OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.96) and in Asians (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.89) but not in Caucasians (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.60-1.42). In addition, stratified analysis for different types of cancers indicated a marginally significant decrease of RR in colorectal cancer patients (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46-1.00) but not in gastric cancer patients (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.53-1.15). However, we did not observe a significant association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and hazard for PFS and OS for gastric and colorectal cancer patients in all tested models.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism may be a valuable genetic marker for platinum-based chemotherapy of gastric and colorectal cancer patients, and more well-designed studies with large samples are needed to confirm our findings.",

A total of 667 unrelated EH patients of Russian origin, including 306 hypertensives (the EH-CS group) who suffered from CS and 361 people (the EH-CS group) who did not have cerebrovascular accidents, were enrolled in the study. The variant allele 718C of the GPX4 gene was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of CS in hypertensive patients (odds ratio (OR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-1.90, P(adj) = 0.0003). The prevalence of the 718TC and 718CC genotypes of the GPX4 gene was higher in the EH-CS group than the EH-alone group (OR = 2.12, 95%CI 1.42-3.16, P(adj) = 0.0018). The association of the variant GPX4 genotypes with the increased risk of CS in hypertensives remained statistically significant after adjusting for confounding variables such as sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and antihypertensive medication use (OR = 2.18, 95%CI 1.46-3.27, P = 0.0015). Multiple logistic regression analysis did not reveal any interaction between various combinations of GPX1, GPX3 and GPX4 genotypes regarding the risk of CS in patients with EH. The study demonstrated for the first time that the C718T polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of the GPX4 gene could be considered as a genetic marker of susceptibility to CS in patients with EH.",

                "text": "Previously, we demonstrated that CD38, a transmembrane protein with ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity, plays a critical role in mouse social behavior by regulating the release of oxytocin (OXT), which is essential for mutual recognition. When CD38 was disrupted, social amnesia was observed in Cd38 knockout mice. The autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), characterized by defects in reciprocal social interaction and communication, occur either sporadically or in a familial pattern. However, the etiology of ASDs remains largely unknown. Therefore, the theoretical basis for pharmacological treatments has not been established. Hence, there is a rationale for investigating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human CD38 gene in ASD subjects. We found several SNPs in this gene. The SNP rs3796863 (C>A) was associated with high-functioning autism (HFA) in American samples from the Autism Gene Resource Exchange. Although this finding was partially confirmed in low-functioning autism subjects in Israel, it has not been replicated in Japanese HFA subjects. The second SNP of interest, rs1800561 (4693C>T), leads to the substitution of an arginine (R) at codon 140 by tryptophan (W; R140W) in CD38. This mutation was found in four probands of ASD and in family members of three pedigrees with variable levels of ASD or ASD traits. The plasma levels of OXT in ASD subjects with the R140W allele were lower than those in ASD subjects lacking this allele. The OXT levels were unchanged in healthy subjects with or without this mutation. One proband with the R140W allele receiving intranasal OXT for approximately 3years showed improvement in areas of social approach, eye contact and communication behaviors, emotion, irritability, and aggression. Five other ASD subjects with mental deficits received nasal OXT for various periods; three subjects showed improved symptoms, while two showed little or no effect. These results suggest that SNPs in CD38 may be possible risk factors for ASD by abrogating OXT function and that some ASD subjects can be treated with OXT in preliminary clinical trials.",

In addition, some polymorphisms of the alcohol metabolism genes have been reported to exert significant impacts on the risk of alcoholism. We investigate the relevance of genetic susceptibility to drinking behavior and its influence on the sensitivity to pressor effects of alcohol in the Japanese general population. We initially screened SNPs in four candidate genes by resequencing. From 35 SNPs thus identified, 10 tag SNPs were selected and used for large-scale association analysis in a total of 5724 subjects. Among the SNPs tested, significant association (P<0.001) with drinking behavior was observed for ADH1B Arg47His (rs1229984) and ALDH2 Glu487Lys (rs671) polymorphisms. All subjects with Lys homozygote (AA genotype) of rs671 turned out to be nondrinkers and the combination of two SNP genotypes appeared to substantially influence people's drinking behavior in a synergistic manner. rs671 was significantly associated with blood pressure (P=0.0001-0.0491) in subgroups of drinkers. In the context of gene-environment interaction, our data clearly show the genetic impacts of two SNPs on drinking behavior and of one SNP on the sensitivity to the pressor effects of alcohol in the Japanese general population.",

The maps of the geographic distribution of the -174G/C allele frequencies were constructed based on personal (22 populations) and the literature data (66 populations), and the data from dbSNP database obtained by the HapMap project (10 populations). The frequency of the -174G allele varied from 45 to 100% and was characterized by nonrandom geographic distribution. These data could reflect the adaptive load of the alleles examined, which was different in different regions of the world. It is suggested that the level of pathogen prevalence is one of the environmental factors that determine different adaptive values of the IL6*--174G/C alleles. This suggestion is supported by a positive correlation between the -174G allele frequency and level of pathogen prevalence calculated based on historical data (R = 0.768; p < 0.0001).",

We aimed to relate the long-term prevalence of asthma or wheeze to functional coding region polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene.\n<b>Methods</b>: The British 1958 birth cohort consisted of all people born in Britain during a week in 1958. Asthma, wheezy bronchitis, and wheezing were ascertained by interview at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33, and 42 years, and lung function tests at 35 and 45 years. DNA samples from 8018 participants in the 45-year follow-up were genotyped for three coding variants in the ADRB2 gene. We extend the follow-up of this nationwide cohort by a further 10 years and relate asthma prevalence, prognosis, and lung function to functional coding region polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene in the cohort members who contributed DNA samples. We also compared and combined our findings with those reaching significance in two previous meta-analyses.\n<b>Findings</b>: Half the cohort (4105 of 8018) had some history of wheezing illness by age 42 years. Neither lifetime prevalence nor age at onset were related to ADRB2 coding variants. However, the common polymorphisms Arg16Gly (rs1042713, Arg 16 allele frequency 36.3%) and Gln27Glu (rs1042714, Glu 27 allele frequency 44.6%) were significantly associated with persistence of asthmatic symptoms from childhood to middle age. Among homozygotes for the Arg16-Gln27 haplotype at these loci, 19.3% (41 of 212) childhood wheezers had five or more wheezing episodes in the past year at age 42, compared with 11.9% (71 of 599) with no copy of this haplotype. However, only 3% of all frequent adult wheezing was statistically attributable to this haplotype. The less common Thr164Ile polymorphism (rs1800888, Ile allele frequency 1.5%) was not a major predictor of either frequency or prognosis of asthma. Our data do not support the findings of previous meta-analyses when considered in isolation or when combined with their contributory studies.\n<b>Interpretation</b>: ADRB2 polymorphisms might predict a small component of the long-term prognosis in childhood asthma, but are not important determinants of asthma incidence or prevalence in the British population.",

                "text": "To investigate the association between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in adiponectin gene promoter and essential hypertension (EH) in Chinese Korean and Han of Yanbian area, 220 EH patients and 268 normotensive control individuals were enrolled. PCR and direct DNA sequencing were used to determine the -11426A>G (rs16861194), -11391G>A (rs17300539), -11377C>G (rs62620185), -11156insCA (rs60806105), and -11043C>T (rs76786086) SNPs in the promoter region of adiponectin gene. Total cholesterol (TC), the triglyceride (TG), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were examined by oxi-dase method. The plasma adiponectin and insulin were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that: (1) SNPs of -11426A>G, -11377C>G, and -11156insCA were found and in Hardy-Weinberg equilib-rium (P>0.05), but not the case in -11391G>A and -11043C>T. (2) -11426A>G and -11156insCA were perfectly in link-age disequilibrium (D'=1; r2=1). (3) The allele G frequency of -11426A>G polymorphism in Chinese Korean (21.10%) was significantly higher than that in Chinese Han (12.50%), and also higher in EH group than in the control group of Chinese Han. The genotype and allele frequencies of -11377C>G showed no significant difference between the two groups ob-served. (4) The haplotype -11426G -11377C frequency in EH of Chinese Han was higher than in the control group (P<0.05). (5) The EH showed lower plasma adiponectin level compared with the control group (P<0.001) in both Chinese Korean and Han. Our results indicate that: (1) the perfect linkage disequilibrium of -11426A>G and -11156insCA is first reported, and the SNP of -11426A>G is associated with Chinese Han and Korean. (2) -11426 G and -11426G -11377C are risk factor and risk haplotype in Yanbian Chinese Han, but not in Chinese-Korean. (3) The lower hypoadiponectinemia is the important risk factors for EH in Chinese Korean and Han of Yanbian area. (4) There is no relationship between -11426A>G polymorphism and the plasma adiponectin level.",

                "text": "<b>Background</b>: Prior animal model and human-based studies have linked selenium concentrations to decreased risk for depression; however, this work has not focused on household groundwater levels or specific depressive symptoms. The current study evaluated the link between groundwater selenium levels and depression. We also sought to determine if a functional polymorphism in the glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) gene impacted this link.\n<b>Methods</b>: We used a cross-sectional design to analyze data from 585 participants (183 men and 402 women) from Project FRONTIER, a study of rural health in West Texas. Residential selenium concentrations were estimated using Geospatial Information System (GIS) analyses. Linear regression models were created using Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30) total and subfactor scores as outcome variables and selenium concentrations as predictor variables. Analyses were re-run after stratification of the sample on GPX1 Pro198Leu genotype (rs1050454).\n<b>Results</b>: Selenium levels were significantly and negatively related to all GDS and subfactor scores accounting for up to 17% of the variance beyond covariates. Selenium was most strongly protective against depression among homozygous carriers of the C allele at the Pro198Leu polymorphism of the GPX1 gene. Analyses also point towards a gene-environmental interaction between selenium exposure and GPX1 polymorphism.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Our results support the link between groundwater selenium levels and decreased depression symptoms. These findings also highlight the need to consider the genetics of the glutathione peroxidase system when examining this relationship, as variation in the GPX1 gene is related to depression risk and significantly influences the protective impact of selenium, which is indicative of a gene-environment interaction.",

In 416 patients with type 2 diabetes, four polymorphisms in the PEDF SNPs were identified, rs12150053 and rs12948385 in the promoter region, rs9913583 in the 5'-untranslated region, and rs1136287 (Met72Thr) in exon 3. Based on case-control studies, rs12150053 and rs12948385, but not rs9913583 and rs1136287, were significantly associated with DR. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the TC or CC genotype of rs12150053 was a significant risk factor for DR (odds ratio 2.40, p=0.0004). The GA or AA genotype of rs12948385 was also a significant risk factor for DR. In addition, a significant interaction between the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and PEDF SNPs in the susceptibility to DR was found. These results demonstrate that the PEDF gene, in cooperation with the VEGF gene, may contribute to the development of DR.",

                "text": "The authors sought to examine the impact of multiple risk alleles for cognitive dysfunction and cardiovascular disease risk on cognitive function and to determine if these relationships varied by cognitive reserve (CR) or concomitant medication use in patients with schizophrenia. They conducted a cross-sectional study in ambulatory mental health centers. A total of 122 adults with a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis who were maintained on a stable antipsychotic regimen for at least 6 months before study enrollment were included. Patients were divided into three CR groups based on years of formal education: no high school completion or equivalent (low-education group [18 patients]), completion of high school or equivalent (moderate-education group [36 patients], or any degree of post-high school education (high-education group [68 patients]). The following pharmacogenomic variants were genotyped for each patient: AGT M268T (rs699), ACE insertion/deletion (or ACE I/D, rs1799752), and APOE \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54 (rs429358 and rs7412). Risk allele carrier status (identified per gene as AGT M268 T carriers, ACE D carriers, and APOE \u03b54 carriers) was not significantly different among CR groups. The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) scale was used to assess cognitive function. The mean \u00b1 SD patient age was 43.9 \u00b1 11.6 years. Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia diagnoses, and use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents, did not significantly differ among CR groups. Mixed modeling revealed that risk allele carrier status was significantly associated with lower verbal memory scores for ACE D and APOE \u03b54 carriers, but AGT T carrier status was significantly associated with higher verbal memory scores (p=0.0188, p=0.0055, and p=0.0058, respectively). These results were only significant in the low-education group. In addition, medication-gene interactions were not significant predictors of BACS scores. ACE D and APOE \u03b54 carrier status, independent of medication use, was associated with lower verbal memory scores in patients with schizophrenia who had relatively lower CR, as identified by formal education. These results suggest that increasing CR may be protective against cognitive impairment that may be worsened by select cardiovascular risk alleles in patients with schizophrenia.",

                "text": "The high morbidity and aggressive behavior of breast cancer are associated with genetic variations. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in many genes have been demonstrated as a risk factor for breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated the association of the SNP rs1982073 (Leu10Pro) in transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFB1) gene and the SNP rs1219648 in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene with the risk and aggressiveness of breast cancer among women of Han nationality in North China. TaqMan allelic discrimination assay was performed to genotype rs1982073 and rs1219648 in 447 breast cancer cases and 406 age-matched healthy controls. The results imply that genotype frequencies of rs1982073 and rs1219648 were not significantly different between breast cancer patients and healthy controls. However, for TGFB1 SNP rs1982073, the C-carriers (T/C+C/C genotype) were more likely to bear tumors of greater aggressiveness (histological grade III) than T/T-carriers (grade I-II) (OR = 3.45, 95% CI: 1.48-8.00, P = 0.004). For FGFR2 SNP rs1219648, G-carriers (A/G+G/G genotype) were more significantly linked to tumors with lymph node metastasis than those with A/A genotype (lymph node negative) (OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.11-2.58, P = 0.016). Therefore, the SNPs of TGFB1 rs1982073 and FGFR2 rs1219648 may contribute to the identification of patients with more aggressive breast cancers among Han women in North China.",

Previous studies showed that the EGF +61G/A polymorphism (rs4444903) may lead to an alteration in EGF production and/or activity, which can result in individual susceptibility to glioma. However, published data regarding the association between the +61G/A polymorphism and glioma risk was contradictory.\n<b>Objective</b>: The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of eligible studies to derive precise estimation of the association of EGF +61G/A with glioma risk.\n<b>Methods</b>: We performed a pooled analysis of seven published studies that included 1,613 glioma cases and 2,267 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. The pooled ORs were performed for codominant model, dominant model, and recessive model, respectively.\n<b>Results</b>: Overall, no significant associations between the EGF +61G/A polymorphism and glioma cancer risk were found for AA versus GG (OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.62-1.45), GA versus GG (OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.72-1.22), AA/GA versus GG (OR=0.93, 95% CI=0.70-1.23), and AA versus GA/GG (OR=1.04, 95% CI=0.77-1.39). However, in the stratified analysis by ethnicity, the EGF +61G/A polymorphism had a higher risk of glioma development among Asians, but a lower risk among Caucasians.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Taken together, the results suggest that the EGF +61G/A polymorphism may contribute to the susceptibility of glioma in different ethnic groups.",

This study investigated the coinheritance of 12 functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human P2X(7) gene (P2RX7), and the functional effect of each singly and in combination was assessed by measurements of ATP-induced currents and ethidium(+) uptake. Genotyping of 3430 Caucasian subjects identified 4 common haplotypes in addition to the common (wild-type) P2X(7)-1. Two haplotypes (denoted P2X(7)-2 and P2X(7)-4) contained various combinations of gain-of-function SNPs. P2X(7)-4 was identified uniquely by the Gln-460 to Arg polymorphism (rs2230912). When expressed in HEK-293 cells, recombinant P2X(7)-2, and P2X(7)-4 haplotypes displayed a 3-fold and 5-fold increase, respectively, in receptor function compared to the wild-type P2X(7)-1. Both P2X(7) haplotypes contained the Ala-348>Thr polymorphism (rs1718119), and this mutation was critical for the gain-of-function effect. Peripheral blood monocytes and erythrocytes from subjects homozygous for gain-of-function P2X(7) haplotypes exhibited increased ATP-induced ethidium(+) uptake and (86)Rb(+) efflux, respectively, and this correlated with increased IL-1beta secretion from LPS-primed monocytes. Inheritance of these P2X(7) haplotypes predisposing to increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion may be important in genetic association studies of inflammatory, infectious, and psychiatric disorders.",

Val174Ala) and ABCG2 c.421C>A (rs2231142, p. Gln141Lys). To investigate the pharmacogenetics of rosuvastatin in African populations, we first screened 785 individuals from nine ethnic African populations for the SLCO1B1 c.521C and ABCG2 c.421CA variants. This was followed by sequencing whole exomes from individuals of African Bantu descent, who participated in a 20 mg rosuvastatin pharmacokinetic trial in Harare Zimbabwe. Frequencies of SLCO1B1 c.521C ranged from 0.0% (San) to 7.0% (Maasai), while ABCG2 c.421A ranged from 0.0% (Shona) to 5.0% (Kikuyu). Variants showing significant association with rosuvastatin exposure were identified in SLCO1B1, ABCC2, SLC10A2, ABCB11, AHR, HNF4A, RXRA and FOXA3, and appear to be African specific. Interindividual differences in the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin in this African cohort cannot be explained by the polymorphisms SLCO1B1 c.521T>C and ABCG2 c.421C>A, but appear driven by a different set of variants.",

The ACCG haplotype consisting of four BDNF markers (Val66Met (rs6265), rs11030104, rs2049045 and rs7103411) showed an association with the risk of smoking (p = 0.0002). Both DRD1 markers tested (rs4532 and rs686) and the DRD3 marker (rs1025398) showed association with quantity of tobacco smoked (p = 0.01, 0.005 and 0.002, respectively).

The goal of this study was to identify the -5 A/G (rs28366003) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the core promoter region of the MT2A gene, and to investigate its effect on allele-specific gene expression and Cd, Zn, Cu and Ni content in sinonasal inverted papilloma tissue (IP), with non-cancerous sinonasal mucosa (NCM) as a control. The MT2A promoter region -5 A/G SNP was identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism using 117 IP and 132 NCM. MT2A gene analysis was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Metal levels were analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The frequency of A allele carriage was 99.2% and 100% in IP and NCM, respectively. The G allele carriage was detected in 23.9% of IP and in 12.1% of the NCM samples. As a result, a significant association of -5 A/G SNP in MT2A gene with mRNA expression in both groups was determined. A significant association was identified between the -5 A/G SNP in the MT2A gene with mRNA expression in both groups. A highly significant association was detected between the rs28366003 genotype and Cd and Zn content in IP. Furthermore, significant differences were identified between A/A and A/G genotype with regard to the type of metal contaminant. The Spearman rank correlation results showed the MT2A gene expression and both Cd and Cu levels were negatively correlated. The results obtained in this study suggest that the -5 A/G SNP in the MT2A gene may have an effect on allele-specific gene expression and toxic metal accumulation in sinonasal inverted papilloma.",

Genetic variants in this gene are associated with PR and QRS intervals. We sought to characterize further the contribution of rare and common coding variation in SCN5A to cardiac conduction.\n<b>Methods And Results</b>: In Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium Targeted Sequencing Study, we performed targeted exonic sequencing of SCN5A (n=3699, European ancestry individuals) and identified 4 common (minor allele frequency >1%) and 157 rare variants. Common and rare SCN5A coding variants were examined for association with PR and QRS intervals through meta-analysis of European ancestry participants from CHARGE, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Exome Sequencing Project (n=607), and the UK10K (n=1275) and by examining Exome Sequencing Project African ancestry participants (n=972). Rare coding SCN5A variants in aggregate were associated with PR interval in European and African ancestry participants (P=1.3\u00d710(-3)). Three common variants were associated with PR and QRS interval duration among European ancestry participants and one among African ancestry participants. These included 2 well-known missense variants: rs1805124 (H558R) was associated with PR and QRS shortening in European ancestry participants (P=6.25\u00d710(-4) and P=5.2\u00d710(-3), respectively) and rs7626962 (S1102Y) was associated with PR shortening in those of African ancestry (P=2.82\u00d710(-3)). Among European ancestry participants, 2 novel synonymous variants, rs1805126 and rs6599230, were associated with cardiac conduction. Our top signal, rs1805126 was associated with PR and QRS lengthening (P=3.35\u00d710(-7) and P=2.69\u00d710(-4), respectively) and rs6599230 was associated with PR shortening (P=2.67\u00d710(-5)).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: By sequencing SCN5A, we identified novel common and rare coding variants associated with cardiac conduction.",

Using a clinical SNP microarray, we identified patUPD14 in a boy with a normal karyotype presenting cardiomyopathy and facial anomalies, a specific configuration of the thoracic ribs ('coat hanger sign'), and hypospadias. Analyses of polymorphic microsatellites confirmed the diagnosis of patUPD14. We discuss the functions of the genes included in the rearrangement and their involvement in the pathogenesis of these disorders, especially hypospadias. ESR2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs944050; 2681-4A>G) have been associated with an increased risk of hypospadias in previous studies. The patient's ESR2 (rs944050) genotype is GG, whereas the parents both exhibit an AG genotype. This report sheds light on the genetic phenomenon in which the combination of a polymorphism and UPD can lead to new phenotypes, such as hypospadias.",

To investigate the role of Tm6sf2 in metabolic homeostasis, we generated mice with elevated expression using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene delivery. Hepatic overexpression of mouse Tm6sf2 resulted in phenotypes previously observed in Tm6sf2-deficient mice including reduced plasma lipid levels, diminished hepatic triglycerides secretion and increased hepatosteatosis. Furthermore, increased hepatic Tm6sf2 expression protected against the development of atherosclerosis in LDL-receptor/ApoB48-deficient mice. In cultured human hepatocytes, Tm6sf2 overexpression reduced apolipoprotein B secretion and resulted in its accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) suggesting impaired ER-to-Golgi trafficking of pre-very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. Analysis of two metabolic trait-associated coding polymorphisms in the human TM6SF2 gene (rs58542926 and rs187429064) revealed that both variants impact TM6SF2 expression by affecting the rate of protein turnover. These data demonstrate that rs58542926 (E167K) and rs187429064 (L156P) are functional variants and suggest that they influence metabolic traits through altered TM6SF2 protein stability. Taken together, our results indicate that cellular Tm6sf2 level is an important determinant of VLDL metabolism and further implicate TM6SF2 as a causative gene underlying metabolic disease and trait associations at the 19p13.11 locus.",

                "text": "<b>Objectives</b>: We explored whether the benefit of intensive versus moderate statin therapy would be greater in carriers of KIF6 719Arg than in noncarriers.\n<b>Background</b>: The 719Arg variant of Trp719Arg (rs20455), a polymorphism in kinesin-like protein 6, is associated with greater risk of coronary events and greater benefit from pravastatin versus placebo.\n<b>Methods</b>: We genotyped 1,778 acute coronary syndrome patients within the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy: Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22) trial and investigated different intensities of statin therapy in carriers of 719Arg and in noncarriers using Cox proportional hazards models that adjusted for traditional risk factors.\n<b>Results</b>: Benefit from intensive, compared with moderate, statin therapy was significantly greater in the 59% of the cohort who were carriers (hazard ratio [HR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 0.77) than in those who were noncarriers (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.27; p = 0.018 for interaction between 719Arg carrier status and treatment). Absolute risk reduction was 10.0% in carriers versus 0.8% in noncarriers. The benefit of intensive therapy in carriers was significant as early as day 30 of therapy. Carriers and noncarriers did not differ in on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Carriers of 719Arg receive significantly greater benefit from intensive statin therapy than do noncarriers, a superior benefit that appears to be due to a mechanism distinct from lipid or CRP lowering. Functional studies of the KIF6 kinesin are warranted, given the consistent association of Trp719Arg with risk of coronary events and statin benefit.",

                "text": "Oxytocin has repeatedly been shown to influence human behavior in social contexts; also, a relationship between oxytocin and the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been suggested. In the present study, we investigated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oxytocin gene (OXT) and the genes for single-minded 1 (SIM1), aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2) and cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) in a population of 1771 children from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS). Statistical analyses were performed to investigate any association between SNPs and autistic-like traits (ALTs), measured through ASD scores in the Autism-Tics, ADHD and other Co-morbidities inventory. Firstly, we found a statistically significant association between the SIM1 SNP rs3734354 (Pro352Thr) and scores for language impairment (p = .0004), but due to low statistical power this should be interpreted cautiously. Furthermore, nominal associations were found between ASD scores and SNPs in OXT, ARNT2 and CD38. In summary, the present study lends support to the hypothesis that oxytocin and oxytocin neuron development may have an influence on the development of ALTs and suggests a new candidate gene in the search for the pathophysiology of ASD.",

The aim of this study was to analyze the association between the Pro12Ala polymorphism and cardiometabolic risk factors in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients.\n<b>Methods</b>: We carried out a cross-sectional study on 257 HIV/HCV coinfected patients. PPAR\u03b32 polymorphism was genotyped by GoldenGate\u00ae assay. The main outcome measures were: i) serum lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), LDL-C/HDL-C, and atherogenic index (AI)); ii) homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) values; iii) serum adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1), hepatic growth factor (HGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF)). Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with gamma distribution (log-link) were used to investigate the association between PPAR\u03b32 polymorphism and continuous outcome variables. This test gives the differences between groups and the arithmetic mean ratio (AMR) in continuous outcome variables between groups.\n<b>Results</b>: The rs1801282 CG/GG genotype was associated with low values of cholesterol (adjusted arithmetic mean ratio (aAMR) = 0.87 (95% of confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.79; 0.96); p = 0.004) and LDL-C (aAMR = 0.79 (95% CI = 0.68; 0.93); p = 0.004). Furthermore, rs1801282 CG/GG was associated with low values of HOMA-IR (aAMR = 0.69 (95% CI = 0.49; 0.98); p = 0.038) among patients with significant liver fibrosis (F \u2265 2). Moreover, rs1801282 CG/GG was also associated with low serum values of hepatic growth factor (HGF) (aAMR = 0.61 (95% CI = 0.39; 0.94); p = 0.028), and nerve growth factor (NGF) (aAMR = 0.47 (95% CI = 0.26; 0.84); p = 0.010). The serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and PAI-1 did not show significant differences.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The presence of PPAR\u03b32 rs1801282 G allele (Ala variant) was associated with a protective cardiometabolic risk profile versus CC genotype in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Thus, PPAR\u03b32 rs1801282 polymorphism may play a significant role in the development of metabolic disorders in HIV/HCV coinfected patients, and might have an influence on the cardiovascular risk.",

We selected the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess the quality of the included studies. We performed a heterogeneity test on the results of the study and calculated the combined odds ratios (ORs) and its corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) under a random- or fixed-effect model. Subgroup analyses were conducted by ethnicity, source of controls, sample size, and genotyping method. Sensitivity analysis was used to insure authenticity of this meta-analysis result. Egger's test and Begg's funnel plot were performed to detect publication bias.Eventually, our meta-analysis included 15 eligible studies. We observed a significant correlation between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and the development of CHD in the recessive model (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.71, P = 0.006) for the overall population. In subgroups stratified by ethnicity and source of controls, subgroup analyses indicated similar associations in Asians and hospital-based groups, but not for Caucasians and population-based groups. Egger's test and Begg's funnel plot demonstrated no significant publication bias in our study.Our analysis identified that MTHFR C677T allele is a risk genetic for CHD development, especially in Asians compared with Caucasians.",

                "text": "We have performed a meta-analysis combining data for more than 11,000 individuals. It provides compelling evidence for a positive association between a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5'-UTR of GDF5 (+104T/C; rs143383) and osteoarthritis (OA) in European and Asian populations. This SNP has recently been reported to be associated with OA in Japanese and Han Chinese populations. Attempts to replicate this association in European samples have been inconclusive, as no association was found in the case-control cohorts from the UK, Spain and Greece when studied individually. However, the pooled data of UK and Spain found an association of the T-allele with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.10. Although the European studies had adequate power to replicate the original findings from the Japanese cohort (OR = 1.79), these results suggest that the role of the GDF5 polymorphism may not be as strong in Europeans. To clarify whether the European studies were hampered by insufficient power, we combined new data from the UK and the Netherlands with the three published studies of Europe and Asia. The results provide strong evidence of a positive association of the GDF5 SNP with knee OA for Europeans as well as for Asians. The combined association for both ethnic groups is highly significant for the allele frequency model (P = 0.0004, OR = 1.21) and the dominant model (P < 0.0001, OR = 1.48). These findings represent the first highly significant evidence for a risk factor for the development of OA which affects two highly diverse ethnic groups.",

A polymorphic variant of the BDNF (Val66Met) confers some differences in the clinical presentation of affective disorders. In this study, we evaluated a sample population from Mexico City to determine whether the BDNF (rs6265) Val66Met polymorphism is associated with the body mass index (BMI) of patients with BD.\n<b>Methods</b>: This association study included a sample population of 357 individuals recruited in Mexico City. A total of 139 participants were diagnosed with BD and 137 were classified as psychiatrically healthy controls (all individuals were interviewed and evaluated by the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay was performed in 96-well plates using the TaqMan Universal Thermal Cycling Protocol. After the PCR end point was reached, fluorescence intensity was measured in a 7,500 real-time PCR system and evaluated using the SDS v2.1 software, results were analyzed with Finetti and SPSS software. Concerning BMI stratification, random groups were defined as follows: normal <25 kg/m(2), overweight (Ow) =25.1-29.9 kg/m(2), and obesity (Ob) >30 kg/m(2).\n<b>Results</b>: In the present work, we report the association of a particular BMI phenotype with the presence of the Val66Met allele in patients with BD (P=0.0033 and odds ratio [95% confidence interval] =0.332 [157-0.703]), and correlated the risk for valine allele carriers with Ow and Ob in patients with BD.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: We found that the methionine allele confers a lower risk of developing Ow and Ob in patients with BD. We also confirmed that the G polymorphism represents a risk of developing Ow and Ob in patients with BD. In future studies, the haplotype analysis should provide additional evidence that BDNF may be associated with BD and BMI within the Mexican population.",

Genetic studies suggested that single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 1911A>G (rs8065080), leading to amino acid substitution Ile585Val, in the TRPV1 gene affects functional activity of TRPV1 receptors and is involved in different pain conditions. However, this polymorphism has not been tested in migraine patients. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate genetic factors of migraine susceptibility. We evaluated frequency distribution of AA, AG, and GG variants of SNP 1911A>G in the TRPV1 gene in patients with episodic and chronic migraine compared with healthy individuals. The study included 46 patients diagnosed with migraine (27 episodic and 19 chronic) and 50 healthy individuals as a control group. DNA from peripheral blood was used to test TRPV1 SNP using allele-specific PCR combined with gel electrophoresis. The genotype frequency distribution in episodic migraine was comparable with that in controls (AA 33%, AG 56%, GG 11% and AA 34%, AG 46%, GG 20%, respectively). On the contrary, in chronic migraine, the distribution differed significantly (p < 0.05) (AA 68%, AG 32%, GG 0%). This are first indications for a distinctive genotype frequency distribution of TRPV1 1911A>G in chronic migraine patients compared with episodic migraine patients and controls. Our data confirm a different predisposition to chronic pain in migraine and give a prerequisite for a new look at the nature of chronification of migraine, proposing that the absence of GG genotype may be considered as possible risk biomarker of episodic migraine evolution to chronic form.",

Here, it was investigated whether the adenosine 2 A receptor gene (ADORA2A) 1976T/C (rs5751876) variant - previously associated with anxiety disorders and anxiety-related phenotypes as well as general attentional efficiency -was involved in the regulation of this network. In detail, fMRI recordings of 65 healthy participants (female=35) were analyzed regarding ADORA2A genotype effects on brain connectivity related to (1) interoceptive processing in terms of functional connectivity resting-state fMRI, and (2) exteroceptive processing using dynamic causal modeling in task-based fMRI. In a subsample, cardiac interoceptive accuracy was furthermore measured via the Mental Tracking Task. ADORA2A genotype was found to modulate a fronto-insular network at rest (interoceptive processing) and while performing an executive control task (exteroceptive processing). Across both modalities, the ADORA2A TT risk genotype was associated with increased connectivity between the insula and the prefrontal cortex. The strength in connectivity correlated with interoceptive accuracy. It is concluded that alterations in fronto-insular connectivity are modulated by both the adenosinergic system and interoceptive accuracy. Thus, fronto-insular connectivity in synopsis with ADORA2A genotypic information could serve as combined biomarkers for personalized treatment approaches in anxiety disorders targeting exteroceptive and interoceptive dysfunction.",

                "text": "<b>Aim</b>: To collectively evaluate the association of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene K469E polymorphism (rs5498) with diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM).\n<b>Methods</b>: Overall review of available literatures relating K469E polymorphism to the risk of DR was conducted on 4 electronic databases. Meta-analysis was performed by Stata 12.0 to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs). Potential sources of heterogeneity and bias were explored.\n<b>Results</b>: Seven studies with genotype frequency data including 1120 cases with DR and 956 diabetic controls free of DR were included. Meta-analysis did not show significant association of K469E polymorphism with DR (P>0.05). A statistically significant association was detected between the K469E polymorphism and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in Asians only in dominant model (GG+AG vs AA) with pooled OR of 0.729 (95%CI: 0.564-0.942, P=0.016, P heterogeneity=0.143), however, this association was not detected in recessive model (GA+AA vs GG; OR=1.178, 95%CI: 0.898-1.545, P=0.236, P heterogeneity=0.248) or allelic model (G vs A; OR=0.769, 95% CI: 0.576-1.026, P=0.074, P heterogeneity=0.094). No publication bias was found by Funnel plot, Begg's and Egger's test.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: This research found no statistically significant association between ICAM-1 gene K469E polymorphism and DR in patients with T2DM, but showed significant association of the K469E polymorphism with PDR in Asian diabetic patients only in dominant model. Further investigation would be required to consolidate the conclusion.",

However, SNPs of specific genes vary among races, and data regarding SNPs in the Korean population are scarce. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationships between SNPs of the COX-1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1RN, and TNF genes and aspirin-induced peptic ulcers, as pilot research in a Korean population.\n<b>Methods</b>: Patients who had been taking low-dose aspirin (100 mg) for at least 4 weeks were prospectively enrolled. DNA was extracted from whole blood, and DNA sequencing was subsequently performed.\n<b>Results</b>: A total of 48 patients were enrolled (23 peptic ulcer patients vs 25 nonulcer controls). Three exon SNPs (IL-1\u03b2 -581C/T [rs1143627], IL-1\u03b2 -1061C/ T [rs16944], and IL-1RN -1129 [rs4251961]) and one intron SNP (IL-1\u03b2 IVS2+242C/T) were significantly different between the two groups. On the multivariate analysis after adjustments for age and sex, the CC/CT genotypes of IL-1\u03b2 -581C/ T, and the CT/TT genotypes of IL-1\u03b2 -1061C/T were positively associated with aspirin-induced peptic ulcers (odds ratio [OR], 4.6, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.054 to 20.303, p=0.04; OR, 4.6, 95% CI, 1.054 to 20.303, p=0.04).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The IL-1\u03b2 -581C/T and IL-1\u03b2 -1061C/T genotypes may be associated with low-dose aspirin-induced peptic ulcers in a Korean ethnic group.",

The aim of this meta-analysis is to investigate the association between CCL5 -28 C>G polymorphism and TB susceptibility.\n<b>Methodology</b>: We performed quantitative synthesis for published studies based upon association between CCL5 -28 C>G polymorphism and TB risk from PubMed (Medline), EMBASE web databases. The meta-analysis was performed and pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for all genetic models.\n<b>Results</b>: A total of six studies including 1324 TB cases and 1407 controls were involved in this meta-analysis.

The genetic-lifestyle interaction was also investigated.\n<b>Results</b>: The results showed that the percentages of TT, GT and GG genotypes for XRCC7 G6721T were differentially distributed as 60.9%, 34.9% and 4.2% in the group of patients with lung cancer and 48.7%, 43.3% and 8.0% in the non-cancer control group, respectively (p=3.6*10(-7)). We further stratified the populations by gender and smoking behavior to investigate their combinatorial effects with XRCC7 G6721T genotype on lung cancer risk. The results showed that the GG genotype of XRCC7 G6721T had a protective effect on lung cancer susceptibility which was obvious among males and smokers (p=2.2\u00d710(-4) and 3.1\u00d710(-4), respectively).\n<b>Conclusion</b>: The GG and GT genotypes of XRCC7 rs7003908 compared to the TT genotype had a protective effect on lung cancer risk in Taiwan, particularly among males and smokers.",

                "text": "Dear Editor, The recent article by Mohammadzadeh et al.[1] on the latest issue of this Journal showed that the T allele +276G/T SNP of ADIPOQ gene is more associated with the increasing risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Adipocytes were described in myocardial tissue of CAD patients and their role recently discussed[2,3]. Susceptibility to CAD by polymorphism in the Q gene of adiponectin has been reported for 3'-UTR, which harbours some genetic loci associated with metabolic risks and atherosclerosis[4]. Actually, previous studies have shown that the haplotype SNP +276G>T was associated with a decreased risk of CAD, after adjustment for potential confounding factors, therefore some controversial opinion still exists[5]. This evidence should be associated with the role exerted by adipocytes and adiponectin in heart physiology. In particular, in hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy (HDCP), by investigating the population frequency of alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely +45T>G (rs2241766) and +276G>T (rs1501299), some authors found that the SNP +276 TT genotype was significantly associated with protection against HDCP, when compared to the pooled G genotypes[6]. Moreover, the same +276G/T SNP haplotype was strongly associated with biliary atresia, an intractable neonatal inflammatory and obliterative cholangiopathy, leading to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis[7]. CAD is closely related to adiponectin biology. The same isoforms of adiponectin seem to be not associated to CAD severity but to glucose metabolism and its impairment[8]. In the paper by Mohammadzadeh et al.[1], T allele in +276G/T SNP haplotype is highly associated with CAD in subjects with type 2 diabetes, but this linkage should be reappraised if related much more to diabetes rather than CAD. Association of T allele in the indicated SNP with CAD may be an indirect consequence of type 2 diabetes, as reported by others[9] or a direct marker for CAD affected patients[10]. The paper by Mohammadzadeh et al.[1] assesses data coming elsewhere from literature but raises important concerns about the suitability of ADIPOQ SNPs in diagnosing susceptibility to CAD and the relationship with plasma adiponectin level. In normal, non diabetic, normoglycemic subject, this relationship does not seem to work. Therefore the question is how much predictive this SNP haplotype may be to foresee metabolic syndrome and CAD onset risk in young health subjects? Maybe, the role of adiponectin in cardiovascular physiology depends on its ability to target adiponectin receptors and to negatively regulate obesity. Some authors reported in healthy volunteers an absence of correlation between circulating adiponectin levels and biochemical markers, particularly lipoproteins and suggested that SNP +276G>T was related to an independent effect on adiponectin levels and on lipoprotein metabolism[11]. On the contrary, adiponectin genetic variants and SNP +276G>T was associated with increasing susceptibility of type 2 diabetes and plasma glucose impairment[12]. The interesting study by Mohammadzadeh et al.[1] suggests that SNP of ADIPOQ +276G>T should be related to susceptibility to glucose metabolism, while indirectly to lipid metabolism and fat-related cardiovascular damage.",

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an important antiinflammatory cytokine, but its genetic polymorphisms and serum levels in Indian MetS subjects are unknown. Three IL-10 gene polymorphisms (-1082A>G (rs1800896), -819C>T (rs1800872) and -592C>A (rs1800871)) were genotyped with PCR-RFLP in MetS subjects (n = 384) and age/sex matched control subjects (n = 386). Serum IL-10 was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum IL-10 level was significantly low in MetS subject and significantly correlated with clinicobiochemical parameters of MetS. Of three investigated promoter polymorphisms, IL-10 -819C> T and -592C>A were significantly associated with risk of MetS. The mutant alleles -819T and -592A of IL-10 gene polymorphism were significantly higher in MetS subjects compared to controls. Of the four different haplotypes obtained, common ACC haplotype and rare GTA haplotype of IL-10 polymorphisms were associated with MetS. The mean of fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were significantly different between the genotypes of both -819 C>T and -592C>A polymorphisms of IL-10 in MetS subjects. These results suggested that polymorphisms in IL-10 gene (-819C>T and -592C>A), haplotypes (ACC and GTA) and serum level are significantly associated with risk of MetS. IL- 10 -819C>T and -592C>A polymorphic variants are also significantly associated with insulin level and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance in north Indian MetS subjects.",

Two well-known CSK (CSK rs34933034 and CSK rs1378942) and two functional PTPN22 (PTPN22 rs2476601 (R620W) and PTPN22 rs33996649 (R263Q)) polymorphisms, previously associated with autoimmunity, were genotyped with TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assays.\n<b>Results</b>: No significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies between HSP patients and controls were observed when the CSK rs34933034, CSK rs1378942, PTPN22 rs2476601 (R620W) and PTPN22 rs33996649 (R263Q) polymorphisms were analyzed independently. In keeping with this observation, no significant differences were found when we assessed these polymorphisms combined conforming haplotypes. In addition, there were no differences in the allele or genotype frequencies when HSP patients were stratified according the age at disease onset, sex, presence of arthralgia/arthritis, nephritis or gastrointestinal manifestations.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our results do not support association between PTPN22/CSK and HSP.",

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the TLR genes may influence host-pathogen interactions and can have an impact on the progression of infectious diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the genotype distribution of TLR2 (2029C/T, rs121917864; 2258G/A, rs5743708), TLR4 (896A/G, rs4986790), and TLR9 (- 1237T/C, rs5743836; - 1486T/C, rs187084; 1174G/A, rs352139; and 2848C/T, rs352140) polymorphisms in 149 children and adolescents with infectious mononucleosis (IM) and 140 healthy individuals. The potential association of TLR SNPs with the clinical manifestations of EBV infection was also studied. The presence of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 SNPs was identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). EBV DNA loads were detected by quantitative real-time PCR assay. The TLR4 896 GG and the TLR9 1174 GA genotypes were associated with an increased risk of EBV-related IM in examined patients (p = 0.014 and p = 0.001, respectively). The heterozygous genotype of the TLR4 896A/G SNP was associated with an increased risk of elevated liver enzyme levels and leukocytosis (p < 0.05). Our preliminary study revealed that the TLR4 896A/G and the TLR9 1174G/A polymorphisms seem to be related to the course of acute EBV infection in children and adolescents.",

We used ABI3730xl and GeneMapper v.4.0 software to identify genotype variations. All patients were followed up and clinically reassessed at three-month intervals. Disability progression was measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and disease severity by the Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale (MSSS).\n<b>Results</b>: We included 37 men and 80 women. We found no evidence regarding the influence of the single nucleotide polymorphisms studied in the Expanded Disability Status Scale or therapeutic response of the evaluated drugs. We performed a logistic regression analysis with the MSSS and found that a less severe MS course was associated with wild type CIITA -168AA and CIITA +1614GG, as the chance of the patient progressing to MSSS2 and MSSS3 decreased in 61% and 75% with CIITA -168AA and 66% and 75% with CIITA +1614GG, respectively (p < 0.0001). Although less significant, the CIITA +1614 GC also pointed to a less severe MS course and the chance of the patient progressing to MSSS3 decreased 79% (p = 0.015). We also observed that the CIITA -168GG genotype was more frequent in MSSS2 and MSSS3 and had 40% lower odds ratio to becoming more severe MS.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: These data suggest that CIITA -168AA, CIITA +1614GG and CIITA +1614 GC polymorphisms may be associated with a better MS clinical course. This knowledge may be useful for a better understanding of MS and its therapeutic management.",

                "text": "<b>Background</b>: Activating mutations in the Transient Receptor Potential channel C6 (TRPC6) cause autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS). TRPC6 expression is upregulated in renal biopsies of patients with idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy (iMN) and animal models thereof. In iMN, disease progression is characterized by glomerulosclerosis. In addition, a context-dependent TRPC6 overexpression was recently suggested in complement-mediated podocyte injury in e.g. iMN. Hence, we hypothesized that genetic variants in TRPC6 might affect susceptibility to development or progression of iMN.\n<b>Methods & Results</b>: Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples of 101 iMN patients and 292 controls. By direct sequencing of the entire TRPC6 gene, 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the iMN cohort, two of which were causing an amino acid substitution (rs3802829; Pro15Ser and rs36111323, Ala404Val). No statistically significant differences in genotypes or allele frequencies between patients and controls were observed. Clinical outcome in patients was determined (remission n = 26, renal failure n = 46, persistent proteinuria n = 29, follow-up median 80 months {range 51-166}). The 13 identified SNPs showed no association with remission or renal failure. There were no differences in genotypes or allele frequencies between patients in remission and progressors.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our data suggest that TRPC6 polymorphisms do not affect susceptibility to iMN, or clinical outcome in iMN.",

                "text": "Interleukin-17A plays a role in tissue inflammation by inducing release of proinflammatory and neutrophil-mobilizing cytokines. We investigated the association between ulcerative colitis (UC) and polymorphisms of IL17A, rs2275913 (-197 G > A), and rs3748067 (*1249 C > T). The study was performed in 475 healthy subjects (controls) and 202 with UC (UC cases), including 113 controls and 64 UC cases from previous study. We employed the multiplex PCR-SSCP method to detect gene polymorphisms. The minor allele frequency of rs2275913 was significantly higher but that of rs3748067 was significantly lower in UC cases than controls. The rs2275913 minor homozygote (AA) had an increased risk of the development of UC, whereas rs3748067 minor carrier (CT + TT) had decreased risks for the development of UC. When compared with LR group (rs2275913 GG + GA with rs3748067 CT + TT), HR group (rs2275913 AA with rs3748067 CC) had a more increased risk of the development of UC (OR, 3.38; p = 0.0007). The polymorphisms of IL17A were associated with the noncontinuous and pancolitis phenotypes of UC. Our results suggest that IL17A polymorphisms (both rs2275913 and rs3748067) influence the susceptibility to and pathophysiological features of UC, coordinately.",

Fixed- or random-effects pooled measures were determined on the bias of heterogeneity tests across studies. Publication bias was examined by Egger's test and the modified Begg's test.\n<b>Results</b>: Eighteen published articles were selected for meta-analysis. Overall analyses showed that rs1042714 (Gln27Glu) was associated with significantly increased obesity risk in the heterozygote model (Gln/Glu vs. Gln/Gln: OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.30, I2 = 49%, P = 0.009) and the dominant model (Gln/Glu + Glu/Glu vs. Gln/Gln: OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.00-1.44, I2 = 55%, P = 0.04), whereas no significant association was found in the other models for rs1042714. Also, no significant association was found between the rs1042713 (Arg16Gly) gene polymorphism and the risk of obesity in all genetic models. In addition, neither rs1042713 (Arg16Gly) nor rs1042714 (Gln27Glu) showed any significant association with obesity susceptibility when the population were stratified based on gender.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: Our meta-analysis revealed that the rs1042714 (Gln27Glu) polymorphism is associated with obesity susceptibility. However, our results do not support an association between rs1042713 (Arg16Gly) polymorphisms and obesity in the populations investigated.

SNP rs1799971 (118A > G, N40D) which occur at a high frequency (40-60%) in Asia and moderate frequency (15%) in samples of European ancestry, is the only common coding variant in the canonical transcript, in non-African populations. Despite extensive studies, the molecular consequences of this variation remained unresolved. The aim of this study was to determine the genetic background of the OPRM1 region of 118G in four representative populations and to assess its potential modulatory effect. Seven common haplotypes with distinct population distribution were identified based on seven SNPs. Three haplotypes carry the 118G and additional highly linked regulatory SNPs (e.g., rs9383689) that could modulate the effect of 118G. Extended analysis in the 1000 Genomes database (n = 2504) revealed a common East Asian-specific haplotype with a different genetic background in which there are no variant alleles for an upstream LD block tagged by the eQTL rs9397171. The major European haplotype specifically includes the eQTL intronic SNP rs62436463 that must have arisen after the split between European and Asian populations. Differentiating between the effect of 118G and these SNPs requires specific experimental approaches. The analysis also revealed a significant increase in two 118A haplotypes with eQTL SNPs associated with drug addiction (rs510769) and obesity (rs9478496) in populations with native Mexican ancestry. Future studies are required to assess the clinical implication of these findings.",

                "text": "The COX2 rs5277 (306G>C) polymorphism has been associated with inflammation-associated cancers. In breast cancer, tumor COX-2 expression has been associated with increased estrogen levels in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and activated Akt-pathway in ER-negative tumors. Our study investigated the impact of COX2 genotypes on early breast cancer events and treatment response in relation to tumor ER status and body constitution. In Sweden, between 2002 and 2008, 634 primary breast cancer patients, aged 25-99 years, were included. Disease-free survival was assessed for 570 rs5277-genotyped patients. Body measurements and questionnaires were obtained preoperatively. Clinical data, patient- and tumor-characteristics were obtained from questionnaires, patients' charts, population registries and pathology reports. Minor allele(C) frequency was 16.1%. Genotype was not linked to COX-2 tumor expression. Median follow-up was 5.1 years. G/G genotype was not associated with early events in patients with ER-positive tumors, adjusted HR 0.77 (0.46-1.29), but conferred an over 4-fold increased risk in patients with ER-negative tumors, adjusted HR 4.41 (1.21-16.02)(p(interaction) = 0.015). Chemotherapy-treated G/G-carriers with a breast volume \u2265 850 ml had an increased risk of early events irrespective of ER status, adjusted HR 8.99 (1.14-70.89). Endocrine-treated C-allele carriers with ER-positive tumors and a breast volume \u2265 850 ml had increased risk of early events, adjusted HR 2.30 (1.12-4.75). COX2 genotype, body constitution and ER status had a combined effect on the risk of early events and treatment response. The high risk for early events in certain subgroups of patients suggests that COX2 genotype in combination with body measurements may identify patients in need of more personalized treatment.",

                "text": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease and major risk factor for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection among preterm infants. The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is involved in oxidative injury responses in the lungs. Two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene have been associated with RSV infection in children. However, it is unclear to what extent this association is confounded by BPD or prematurity. In this study, we analyzed two population-based cohorts of preterm infants at risk for BPD as well as ethnicity-matched infants born at term, to test whether the TLR4 polymorphisms Asp299Gly (rs4986790) and Thr399Ile (rs4986791) are independently associated with BPD or premature birth. In a Canadian cohort (n = 269) composed of a majority of Caucasian preterm infants (BPD incidence of 38%), the TLR4-299 heterozygous genotype was significantly under-represented in infants without BPD (1.6% of infants versus 12% in infants with severe BPD) after adjusting for twins, ethnicity, gestational age, birth weight and gender (p = 0.014). This association was not replicated in a Finnish cohort (n = 434) of premature singletons or first-born siblings of Caucasian descent, although the incidence of BPD was substantially lower in this latter population (15%). We did not detect a significant association (>2-fold) between TLR4 genotypes and prematurity (p>0.05). We conclude that these TLR4 genotypes may have, at best, a modest influence on BPD severity in some populations of high-risk preterm infants. Further studies are warranted to clarify how clinical heterogeneity may impact genetic susceptibility to BPD.",

                "text": "<b>Background</b>: Linkage and congenic strain analyses using the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse as a model for human type 1 autoimmune diabetes (T1D) have identified several NOD mouse Idd (insulin dependent diabetes) loci, including Slc11a1 (formerly known as Nramp1). Genetic variants in the orthologous region encompassing SLC11A1 in human chromosome 2q35 have been reported to be associated with various immune-related diseases including T1D. Here, we have conducted association analysis of this candidate gene region, and then investigated potential correlations between the most T1D-associated variant and RNA expression of the SLC11A1 gene and its splice isoform.\n<b>Methods</b>: Nine SNPs (rs2276631, rs2279015, rs1809231, rs1059823, rs17235409 (D543N), rs17235416 (3'UTR), rs3731865 (INT4), rs7573065 (-237 C \u2192 T) and rs4674297) were genotyped using TaqMan genotyping assays and the polymorphic promoter microsatellite (GT)n was genotyped using PCR and fragment length analysis. A maximum of 8,863 T1D British cases and 10,841 British controls, all of white European descent, were used to test association using logistic regression. A maximum of 5,696 T1D families were also tested for association using the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT). We considered P \u2264 0.005 as evidence of association given that we tested nine variants in total. Upon identification of the most T1D-associated variant, we investigated the correlation between its genotype and SLC11A1 expression overall or with splice isoform ratio using 42 PAXgene whole blood samples from healthy donors by quantitative PCR (qPCR).\n<b>Results</b>: Using the case-control collection, rs3731865 (INT4) was identified to be the variant most associated with T1D (P = 1.55 \u00d7 10-6). There was also some evidence of association at rs4674297 (P = 1.57 \u00d7 10-4). No evidence of disease association was obtained at any of the loci using the family collections (PTDT \u2265 0.13). We also did not observe a correlation between rs3731865 genotypes and SLC11A1 expression overall or with splice isoform expression.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: We conclude that rs3731685 (INT4) in the SLC11A1 gene may be associated with T1D susceptibility in the European ancestry population studied. We did not observe a difference in SLC11A1 expression at the RNA level based on the genotypes of rs3731865 in whole blood samples. However, a potential correlation cannot be ruled out in purified cell subsets especially monocytes or macrophages.",

Moreover, it has been implicated in the regulation of lipid metabolism, as well as the maturation of monocytes/macrophages and the control of inflammatory reactions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the Pro12Ala (rs1808212) PPARG gene polymorphism on immune molecular and cellular components in mothers and their offspring participating in the PREOBE study.\n<b>Methods</b>: DNA from maternal venous blood samples at 24, 34 and 40 gestational weeks, plus cord blood samples was extracted.

Only CD19 levels in peripheral blood were significantly higher at delivery in pregnant women carrying the CC (Pro12Pro) genotype (p \u2264 0.001). Moreover, there were statistically significant differences in leukocytes and neutrophils maternal levels at 34 weeks of gestation, being lower in carriers of Pro12Ala genotype (p = 0.028 and p = 0.031, respectively).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Results suggest that Pro12Ala PPARG polymorphism may have an effect on some cell and immune parameters in pregnant women during pregnancy and at time of delivery.

Individual predisposing factors, including polymorphisms in detoxification enzymes, have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis and heterogeneity of the disease. Genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) that alter enzyme activity could be an additional factor that increases the risk of acute leukemia, but data are lacking in Argentina. We assessed the association of GST polymorphisms and the susceptibility to childhood leukemia in Argentina by conducting an exploratory case-control study and correlated patients' genotype to clinical and biological features.\n<b>Methods</b>: Deletion polymorphisms in GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes and the single nucleotide polymorphism in GSTP1 c.313A>G (rs1695; p.105Ile>Val) were genotyped by PCR-RFLP in 36 patients and 133 healthy individuals.\n<b>Results</b>: GSTM1-null genotype was associated with a lower risk of developing acute leukemia (P = 0.013; OR: 0.31; CI: 0.12-0.80), while GSTP1-GG variants displayed an increased risk (P = 0.01; OR: 3.9; CI: 1.85-8.2). However, no differences were found for GSTT1 gene. Conclusion These preliminary results, to be validated in a larger population from Argentina, suggest that the development of pediatric leukemia may be differentially influenced by polymorphic variants in GST genes.",

In this study we evaluated the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCA1 gene. We analyzed SNPs in chromosome 9 such as rs2230806 (R219K) in the position 107620867, rs2230808 (R1587K) in the position 106602625 and rs4149313 (I883M) in the position 106626574 according to gender and lipid profile of Greek nurses.\n<b>Methods</b>: The study population consisted of 447 (87 men) unrelated nurses who were genotyped for ABCA1 gene polymorphisms. Additionally, lipid profile [total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1] was evaluated.\n<b>Results</b>: The distribution of all three studied ABCA1 gene polymorphisms did not differ according to gender. However, only R219K genotype distribution bared borderline statistical significance (p = 0.08) between the two studied groups. Moreover, allele frequencies of R219K, R1587K and I88M polymorphisms did not differ according to gender. In general, blood lipid levels did not seem to vary according to ABCA1 gene polymorphisms, when testing all subjects or when testing only men or only women. However, a significant difference of LDL-C distribution was detected in all subjects according to R1587K genotype, indicating lower LDL-C levels with KK polymorphism (p = 0.0025). The above difference was solely detected on female population (p = 0.0053).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: The ABCA1 gene polymorphisms frequency, distribution and lipid profile did not differ according to gender. However, in the female population the KK genotype of R1587K gene indicated lower LDL-C levels. Further studies, involving a higher number of individuals, are required to clarify genes and gender contribution.",

In this study, we investigated a possible association between interleukin-10 (IL-10) -1082A\u2044G (rs1800896) and interferon (IFN)-gamma +874T/A (rs2430561) promoter polymorphisms and tuberculosis (TB) in the Azeri population of Iran. IL-10 -1082G/A and IFN-gamma +874T/A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped by amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR in 200 healthy controls and 124 tuberculosis patients. IL-10 -1082 A allele was more frequent in the control group than in the patient group (p=0.001, odds ratio [OR]=2.183). On the other hand, the AA genotype was significantly more frequent in the control group (p=0.0001). The frequency of IFN-gamma +874 T allele was significantly higher in the controls (p=0.013, OR=1.56). There was no significant association between IFN-gamma +874 T/A genotypes and susceptibility to tuberculosis (p=0.078), but TT genotype was more frequent in the control group. Our findings suggest that interleukin-10 -1082G/A polymorphism may play an important role in susceptibility to tuberculosis in our population. On the other hand, the +874T allele, which has been suggested to be associated with high IFN-gamma levels, was significantly higher in the controls and TT genotype was also more frequent in the control group. Thus, +874 T allele may be associated with resistance to tuberculosis in this Azeri population of Iran.",

                "text": "According to the results of the first genome-wide association study of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) may serve an important role. However, a number of case-control studies have not been able to replicate this result using the same genetic markers. In the present study, the role of common genetic variants of ERAP1 in AS was investigated using two-stage bioinformatics analysis. In the first stage, a classical meta-analysis was performed to assess AS susceptibility markers in ERAP1 using data from available published case-control association studies. The summary odds ratios for 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed to be statistically significant in different studies. In the second stage, the functional effects of these genetic ERAP1 variants were investigated using prediction tools and structural analyses. The K528R (rs30187) substitution SNP in ERAP1 was termed as likely damaging by PolyPhen-2 software, was observed to be located close to the entrance of the substrate pocket, and was predicted to contribute to reduced ERAP1 aminopeptidase activity. In addition, the R725Q (rs17482078) SNP, which was an additional potentially damaging substitution, was suggested to decrease the enzymatic activity of ERAP1, as this substitution may lead to the loss of two hydrogen bonds between R725 and D766 and affect the stability of the C-terminus of ERAP1. In conclusion, the results of the two-stage bioinformatics analysis supported the hypothesis that ERAP1 may present an important susceptibility gene for AS. In addition, the results revealed that two functional SNPs (rs30187 and rs17482078) demonstrated the potential to decrease the enzymatic activity of ERAP1 by affecting its protein structure. Further protein structure-guided studies of the specificity and activity of these ERAP1 variants are therefore warranted.",

                "text": "<b>Purpose</b>: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a central role in promoting angiogenesis and is over-expressed in renal cell cancer (RCC). Published data on the association between polymorphisms of vascular endothelial growth factor (e.g., -2578C/A [rs699947], -460T/C [rs833061], +405C/G [rs2010963], and +936C/T [rs3025039]) and the risk of renal cell carcinoma are ambiguous and controversial. The aim of this investigation was to investigate this relationship in a series of Caucasian Spanish patients.\n<b>Materials And Methods</b>: A case-control study was performed with 216 cases and 280 controls, genotyping subjects for VEGF polymorphisms using the predesigned TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The combined effect of the four gene polymorphisms on overall survival was studied by haplotype analysis.\n<b>Results</b>: The overall results suggest that polymorphisms or haplotypes in the VEGF gene do not modify the risk of RCC. We were unable to replicate the association of the -460T/C (rs833061) polymorphism with renal cancer risk. Data were also gathered on clinical-pathological results, tumor size, clinical stage, histological grade, and survival.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: According to our analysis of their contribution to prognostic factors, VEGF polymorphisms do not appear to exert a significant influence on RCC progression or prognosis. This finding might be explained by the tumor biology and pathogenesis of clear cell RCC. Additional studies with larger sample sizes are needed in different ethnic groups to further assess this association.",

We genotyped five UCP3 polymorphisms (rs1800849, rs1800006, rs2075577, rs647126, and rs591758) and one MTHFR 677C>T (rs1801133) polymorphism. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured with a maximal ergometer bike test.\n<b>Results</b>: Youth homozygous or heterozygous for the T allele of the rs1800849 polymorphism had significantly higher levels of homocysteine than those carrying the CC genotype (8.56+/-4.72 micromol/L vs. 7.72+/-2.73 micromol/L, respectively, P=0.011) after adjusting for gender, age, pubertal status, folate and vitamin B(12) intake and MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism, whereas no association was observed for the other analysed polymorphisms. There was a significant interaction effect of fitnessxrs1800849 polymorphism (P=0.042). The effect of the rs1800849 polymorphism on homocysteine levels persisted in youth with low fitness, whereas it was abolished in those with moderate or high cardiorespiratory fitness (P>0.1).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Cardiorespiratory fitness modifies the association between the rs1800849 polymorphism and homocysteine so that the negative effect of the T allele does not persist in youth with moderate to high levels of fitness.",

A population-based case-control study of 373 lung cancer patients and 360 healthy control subjects (individually matched on age and gender) in a Chinese population was conducted. Genomic DNA was extracted by the phenol-chloroform method from the peripheral blood. PARP-1 Val762Ala polymorphism was identified using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragments length polymorphism technique. After adjusting for age, tobacco smoking, gender, smoking index, and drinking status, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that CC genotype in PARP-1 Val762Ala polymorphism had an increased risk of lung cancer compared with TT genotype (OR = 1.59, 95 % CI = 1.03 ~ 2.50, P = 0.048), a statistically difference that still existed when merging CC and TC genotypes (OR = 1.56, 95 % CI = 1.03 ~ 2.44, P = 0.042). However, no obvious difference was found between TT and TC (OR = 1.54, 95 % CI = 0.96 ~ 2.44, P = 0.073). Subgroup analysis by histological type indicated that adenocarcinoma patients had higher frequencies of CC or TC+CC genotypes than healthy controls (CC: OR = 1.85, 95 % CI = 1.12 ~ 3.03, P = 0.015; TC+CC: OR = 1.67, 95 % CI = 1.06 ~ 2.63, P = 0.027, respectively), but no statistically significant difference within each genotype in squamous cell carcinoma or small cell lung cancer (all P > 0.05). Our findings support the view that PARP-1 Val762Ala polymorphism may contribute to an increased risk of lung cancer in the Chinese population, especially for adenocarcinoma.",

Identifying genes associated with alcohol misuse in youth is important given that the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences on alcoholism varies across development. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between a polymorphism of the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) and alcohol misuse in a sample of youth and to test whether heightened sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of alcohol mediated this relationship.\n<b>Methods</b>: Adolescents (n = 187; mean age = 15.4 years; 47.6% female) were genotyped for A118G (rs1799971), a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the OPRM1 gene, and assessed for alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnoses and other psychopathology. Alcohol misuse was also measured continuously to maximize detection of drinking problems in youth. Drinking motives were used to capture the extent to which youth consumed alcohol to enhance positive affect.\n<b>Results</b>: AUD groups differed significantly in terms of allelic distributions of the A118G SNP, such that 51.9% of youth with an AUD carried at least one copy of the G allele compared to 16.3% of non-AUD controls. Those who carried the G allele endorsed drinking to enhance positive affect more strongly than those who were homozygous for the A allele and drinking to enhance positive affect mediated the association between OPRM1 and alcohol-related problems.\n<b>Conclusions</b>: These data build on findings from adult studies and provide the first evidence that a polymorphism of the OPRM1 receptor gene is associated with the development of early-onset alcohol-related problems during adolescence, in part, by heightening sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of alcohol.",

The present study aimed to replicate these associations; in addition, the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) was assessed. The polymorphisms were genotyped in subjects recruited from the normal population (n = 510), and possible associations between genotype and body mass index (BMI) were assessed. The Ser23 allele was more common in underweight subjects (BMI <20) than in normal- and overweight (BMI > or =20) subjects (P = .006). The T allele of the -759C/T polymorphism was less common in the overweight group (BMI > or =25) (P = .007). Homozygosity for the short allele of 5-HTTLPR was more frequent in underweight subjects (P = .015). Our results are in agreement with previous studies, suggesting polymorphisms in HTR2C to be associated with body weight, particularly in women; and they also suggest that 5-HTTLPR may influence this phenotype. Further studies on the importance of the investigated genes for eating disorders and drug-induced weight gain are warranted.",

Subsequent population-based studies of the association between the LRP5 gene and BMD have yielded conflicting results. The present study was aimed at examining the association between LRP5 gene and BMD by using meta-analysis.\n<b>Methods</b>: A systematic electronic search of literature was conducted to identify all published studies in English on the association between LRP5 gene and osteoporosis-related phenotypes, including bone mineral density and fracture. BMD data were summarized from individual studies by LRP5 genotype, and a synthesis of data was performed with random-effects meta-analyses. After excluding studies on animal and review papers, there were 19 studies for the synthesis. Among these studies, 10 studies used the rs3736228 (A1330V) polymorphism and reported BMD values.\n<b>Results</b>: The 10 eligible studies comprised 16,705 individuals, with the majority being women (n = 8444), aged between 18 - 81 years. The overall distribution of genotype frequencies was: AA, 68%, AV and VV, 32%. However, the genotype frequency varied significantly within as well as between ethnic populations. On random-effects meta-analysis, lumbar spine BMD among individuals with the AA genotype was on average 0.018 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.012 to 0.023) g/cm2 higher than those with either AV or VV genotype. Similarly, femoral neck BMD among carriers of the AA genotype was 0.011 (95%CI: 0.004 to 0.017) g/cm2 higher than those without the genotype. While there was no significant heterogeneity in the association between the A1330V polymorphism and lumbar spine BMD (p = 0.55), the association was heterogeneous for femoral neck BMD (p = 0.05). The probability that the difference is greater than one standard deviation was 0.34 for femoral neck BMD and 0.54 for lumbar spine BMD.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: These results suggest that there is a modest effect of the A1330V polymorphism on BMD in the general population, and that the modest association may limit its clinical use.",

Studies have suggested ApoM to be important for the formation of pre-\u03b2-HDL and to increase cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells. The aim of this study was to explore the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ApoM promoter with coronary atherosclerotic disease (CAD), and the contribution of latent factors.\n<b>Methods</b>: ApoM was measured in samples from two separate case-control studies, of whom 88 patients developed CAD and 88 were controls. Whole-blood samples from subjects were genotyped by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Luciferase activities were measured for HepG2 cells with two SNPs, rs805296 (T-778C) and rs940494 (T-855C), and after interfering with or overexpressing the predicted transcription factors. The ability of the SNPs to combine with nucleoproteins was analysed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).\n<b>Results</b>: Mean plasma ApoM concentrations in the CAD and non-CAD groups were 9.58 \u00b1 4.30 and 12.22 \u00b1 6.59 \u00b5g/ ml, respectively. Correlation studies of ApoM concentrations with several analytes showed a marked positive correlation with HDL-C, fasting plasma glucose and triglyceride levels. The CC genotype showed lower luciferase activities compared to the TC and TT genotypes. The ApoM-855 mutant-type could bind to the AP-2\u03b1. Interference and overexpression of AP-2 increased and decreased luciferase activities of the wild and mutant types to different degrees.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: ApoM may be a biomarker of CAD. ApoM-855 T\u2192C substitution provides binding sites for AP-2\u03b1 and reduces ApoM transcription activity.",

This observation implied that gene polymorphisms affecting the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may influence the risk for breast cancer in this population. Hence, we performed genotyping for three more functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) responsible for variations in the levels of cytokines associated with inflammation. To that effect, polymorphisms in genes coding for IL-4 (IL-4 C-590T; rs2243250), IFN-\u03b3 (IFN-G A + 874T; rs2430561) and MCP-1 (MCP-1 A-2578G; rs1024611) were examined in premenopausal, healthy women (N = 239) and patients with breast cancer (N = 182) from western India. In carriers of the IL-4*590T allele, a reduced risk for the disease (dominant model; OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.37-0.98) was seen similar to that seen in TGF-B1*10C carriers. An opposite trend was observed with respect to the alleles associated with higher expression of MCP-1 or IFN-\u03b3. In individuals positive for three or more alleles associated with higher levels of either pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines, an additive effect on the modulation of risk for the disease was evident (for TGF-B1 &amp; IL-4, OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.87; for IFN-G &amp; MCP-1, OR = 2.29, 95% CI 0.95-5.51). In the context of contrasting observations in other populations, these results indicate a significant contribution of anti-inflammatory genotypes in the modulation of risk for breast cancer in western Indian women.",

Iron may catalyze the Fenton reaction resulting in overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Transferrin receptor 2 plays a critical role in iron homeostasis and variability in its gene may influence oxidative stress and AMD occurrence. To verify this hypothesis we assessed the association between polymorphisms of the TFR2 gene and AMD. A total of 493 AMD patients and 171 matched controls were genotyped for the two polymorphisms of the TFR2 gene: c.1892C>T (rs2075674) and c.-258+123T>C (rs4434553). We also assessed the modulation of some AMD risk factors by these polymorphisms. The CC and TT genotypes of the c.1892C>T were associated with AMD occurrence but the latter only in obese patients. The other polymorphism was not associated with AMD occurrence, but the CC genotype was correlated with an increasing AMD frequency in subjects with BMI < 26. The TT genotype and the T allele of this polymorphism decreased AMD occurrence in subjects above 72 years, whereas the TC genotype and the C allele increased occurrence of AMD in this group. The c.1892C>T and c.-258+123T>C polymorphisms of the TRF2 gene may be associated with AMD occurrence, either directly or by modulation of risk factors.",

To investigate the potential association between polymorphisms of the NPPA gene and stroke in a Korean population, nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NPPA and NPPB genes were genotyped in a total of 941 Korean subjects, including 674 stroke patients (109 hemorrhagic and 565 ischemic) and 267 unaffected controls. Genotype comparisons of the targeted alleles revealed that there were no significant associations between stroke patients and control subjects, or among hemorrhagic, ischemic, and control groups. However, in logistic analysis for Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification of ischemic stroke, nonsynonymous rs5065 (STOP152Arg) and rs5067 in 3'UTR of NPPA, which were in complete linkage disequilibrium, showed significant associations with cardioembolic stroke. These two SNPs showed higher frequencies in cardioembolic stroke patients than those in controls and ischemic patients with small-vessel occlusion (p=0.002, adjusted p=0.02). It was also found that NPPA rs5065C allele in all of the Korean subjects existed as heterozygous compared with Caucasian and African populations. Although further replications in larger cardioembolic stroke subjects are required, our preliminary findings suggest that the nonsynonymous rs5065C of the NPPA gene, which could produce a new or dysfunctional transcript, is possibly associated with cardioembolism.",

The genotypes were analyzed using TaqMan genotyping assay and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotype and allele frequencies were computed using chi-square or Fisher's exact test (two-tailed) by SPSS 21 software. The results showed that rs1801321G>T GG genotype and G allele frequency were strongly (P<0.0001) related to an elevated risk of breast cancer, while the mutant T allele appeared to provide protection against breast cancer development as observed from the significantly lower (P<0.0001) frequencies of the TT and GT genotypes in cancer patients compared to the healthy controls. The variant rs1801320G>C showed no significant differences in the frequencies of the genotypes and alleles in the patients and the control groups. The CC genotype and C allele frequency of rs2619681 (C>T) variant were significantly (P=0.012) higher in cancer patients, whereas the T allele showed a protective effect against cancer development. The frequencies of the three single-nucleotide polymorphisms did not differ in cancer patients with different tumor grades and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status (+ or -). However, the genotype frequency of rs1801320 (135G>C) differed in the patients with estrogen receptor (ER)+ and ER-, where CC genotype showed a significantly higher prevalence in the females with ER- who were suffering from breast cancer. In addition, the frequency of C allele of rs2619681 (C>T) was also significantly higher in the breast cancer patients who were ER+ and progesterone receptor (PR)+ compared to those with ER- and PR-. In the Saudi females, rs1801320 did not show an association with risk of breast cancer. Taken together, the results suggest that RAD51 rs1801321 polymorphism may be involved in the etiology of breast cancer in the Saudi females; however, further studies are necessary to confirm this relation.",

To explain this association, we compared clinical outcomes according to their genotype in normal (control) and low HDL (case) groups. In both the case and control groups, the rare alleles of rs662799 and rs2075291 were associated with higher triglyceride and lower HDL-cholesterol levels. In the subjects with the rs662799 CC genotype, lower levels of apoA-I and apoA-V and a smaller low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size were detected in both the case and control groups. In the case group, APOA5 rs662799 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with lower adiponectin and higher brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV). Our results show that two APOA5 variants, rs662799 (-1131T>C) and rs2075291 (c.553G>T), are associated with HDL-cholesterol levels in a Korean population, and suggest that individuals with an APOA5 rs662799 CC genotype are at higher risk of atherosclerosis, particularly when they have low HDL-cholesterol, and this association is related to adiponectin levels.",

Our study focuses on the identification of polymorphic variants of XRCC3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and an analysis of the relationship between these polymorphic variants and clinicopathological (including the genotype specific risk) and survival characteristics. Fifty cases of HCC were genotyped using molecular biology techniques for Thr241Met, rs861539 (c.722C>T) and 5'-UTR, rs1799796 (c.562-14A>G) polymorphisms. Statistical analysis was based on \u00b4\uf0632, Fisher's, logistic regression (odd ratio - OR), and log-rank tests. Statistically significant differences were shown only for rs1799796 A>G and tumour grade, between wild type (AA) and heterozygote (AG) genotypes, and wild type (AA) and heterozygote &amp; homozygote (AG &amp; GG) genotypes. The logistic regression analysis found an OR of rs1799796 polymorphism occurrence in HCC related to tumour grade. The statistical analysis revealed, for the rs861539 C>T polymorphism, a better survival only for the homozygote genotype (TT) compared to the heterozygote (CT), and for rs1799796 A>G polymorphism, a longer survival for the wild type (AA) compared to heterozygote (AG) and to heterozygote &amp; homozygote (AG &amp; GG) genotypes, respectively. Our results suggest that XRCC3 gene SNPs could influence the tumour aggressiveness expressed by tumour grade.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of CD226 rs727088 and rs763361 polymorphisms and susceptibility to RA in a sample of the Iranian population.\n<b>Methods</b>: This case-control study was carried out on 100 patients with RA and 104 healthy subjects. The polymorphisms were determined using tetra amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction assay.\n<b>Results</b>: The rs763361 (Gly307Ser) polymorphism increased the risk of RA in codominant, dominant and recessive-tested inheritance models (odds ratio [OR] = 3.18, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] = 1.44-7.02, P = 0.004, CC vs. TT, and OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.10-3.57, P = 0.023, CC vs. CT-TT, and OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.26-5.37, P = 0.010, CC + CT vs. TT, respectively). In addition, the rs763361 T allele increased the risk of RA (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.38-3.08, P<0.001). However, no significant difference was observed among the groups regarding CD226 rs727088 polymorphism (\u03c72 = 3.20, P = 0.202).\n<b>Conclusions</b>: Our finding showed that CD226 rs763361, but not rs727088, gene polymorphism increased the risk of RA in a sample of the Iranian population.",

Both clinical and pharmacological studies have implicated the common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 196, Val66Met in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), and antidepressant response. However, inconsistent results were found between Val66Met (rs6265) polymorphism and treatment response phenotypes in genetic association studies. The functional Val66Met polymorphism and seven other tagging SNP markers selected to capture the major allelic variations across BDNF locus were analyzed in depressed patients, treated with antidepressants, and 76 control patients. Two hundred and six patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV MDD were recruited for this study and genotyped for eight BDNF tagging SNPs (rs11030096, rs925946, rs10501087,rs6265, rs12273363, rs908867, rs1491850, and rs1491851)to investigate the functional impact of genotypes/haplotypes in the susceptibility of depression and on treatment response. None of the eight SNPs, including the rs6265, were significantly associated with MDD after permutation correction. However, we found an association for rs10501087, rs6265 with nonresponse to antidepressant treatment (corrected permutation P:0.03599; 0.0399 and power: 0.1420; 0.1492, respectively).Analysis of each two-marker, three-marker, and four-marker sliding window haplotypes showed significance in haplotype combinations. Especially rs10501087 (C), rs6265 (A), and rs149,1850 (C) together or with the other SNP haplotypes showed a similar pattern in all treatment response phenotypes. Despite the limited power of analysis, our results suggest that these three SNPs may play a role in antidepressant treatment response phenotypes in MDD.",

There are few reports of this polymorphism's effect on memory and on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The M129V genotype distributions among Asians are very different from Caucasians. Another polymorphism, codon 219 (E219K) is not found in Caucasians. We investigated two polymorphisms of PRNP, M129V (rs1799990) and E219K (rs1800014) in 297 Korean AD patients and 217 healthy subjects. The analysis of the genotype and allele distributions showed no significant difference between the AD patients and the controls in both polymorphisms (P=0.19 genotype, P=0.51 allele for M129V; P=0.64 genotype, P=0.50 allele for E219K). Also, the PRNP polymorphisms were not significantly associated with AD when the populations were stratified for the presence or absence of apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 (ApoE-epsilon4) allele. These results suggest that the PRNP genetic variants are not associated with the risk for AD in Korean population.",

                "text": "<b>Background And Aim</b>: Some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). As one of the genetic factors, PNPLA3 rs738409 (I148M) is important to associate with pathogenesis of NAFLD. Because other SNPs remain unclear in Japan, we performed a high-throughput sequencing that targeted more than 1000 genes to identify a novel genetic variant in Japanese patients with NAFLD.\n<b>Methods</b>: The present study in 36 NAFLD patients and 27 healthy volunteers was performed. A high-throughput sequencer was used to detect the gene variations. Candidate genes were validated by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay in 53 NAFLD patients and 41 healthy volunteers. To investigate the function of candidate gene, we performed biochemical analyses in cultured hepatocytes and liver tissues.\n<b>Results</b>: EXO1 rs1047840, PTPRD rs35929428, IFNAR2 rs2229207, CPOX rs1131857, IL23R rs1884444, IL10RA rs2228055, and FAM3B rs111988437 were identified as candidate genetic variants, and PTPRD rs35929428 was only extracted as a SNP predicting to cause protein dysfunction. In validation analysis, PTPRD rs35929428 associated with the development of NAFLD (P = 0.015, odds ratio = 5.00, 95% confidence interval: 1.33-18.70). In addition, PTPRD rs35929428 was associated with Fib-4 index and with hepatic fat droplets. Biochemical analyses indicated that PTPRD rs35929428 promoted dephosphorylation of tyrosine 705 signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Tyr 705) in hepatocytes.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: PTPRD rs35929428 was a novel SNP in patients with NAFLD. Through exacerbation of the dephosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Tyr 705) in hepatocytes, PTPRD rs35929428 might play a role in hepatic lipid accumulation and fibrosis, followed by the development of NAFLD.",

This study aims to explore the causes, clinical manifestations and therapeutic outcomes of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), a rare form of LQTS with congenital sensorineural deafness, in Chinese individuals.\n<b>Materials And Methods</b>: Three JLNS kindreds from the Chinese National LQTS Registry were investigated. Mutational screening of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 genes was performed by polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequence analysis. LQTS phenotype and therapeutic outcomes were evaluated for all probands and family members.\n<b>Results</b>: We identified 7 KCNQ1 mutations. c.1032_1117dup (p.Ser373TrpfsX10) and c.1319delT (p.Val440AlafsX26) were novel, causing JLNS in a 16-year-old boy with a QTc (QT interval corrected for heart rate) of 620 ms and recurrent syncope. c.605-2A>G and c.815G>A (p.Gly272Asp) caused JLNS in a 12-year-old girl and her 5-year-old brother, showing QTc of 590 to 600 ms and recurrent syncope. The fourth JLNS case, a 46-year-old man carrying c.1032G>A (p.Ala344Alasp) and c.569G>A (p.Arg190Gln) and with QTc of 460 ms, has been syncope-free since age 30. His 16-year-old daughter carries novel missense mutation c.574C>T (p.Arg192Cys) and c.1032G>A(p.Ala344Alasp) and displayed a severe phenotype of Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS) characterized by a QTc of 530 ms and recurrent syncope with normal hearing. Both the father and daughter also carried c.253G>A (p.Asp85Asn; rs1805128), a rare single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on KCNE1. Bizarre T waves were seen in 3/4 JLNS patients. Symptoms were improved and T wave abnormalities became less abnormal after appropriate treatment.\n<b>Conclusion</b>: This study broadens the mutation and phenotype spectrums of JLNS. Compound heterozygous KCNQ1 mutations can result in both JLNS and severe forms of RWS in Chinese individuals.",

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the associations between interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their susceptibility to SLE and the implications for plasma levels. We genotyped IL-6-174G/C (rs1800795) using mutagenically separated polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) and IL-10-1082G/A (rs1800896) and -819C/T (rs1800871) using sequence specific primer polymerase chain reaction (SSP-PCR) in 100 Egyptian patients and 119 controls. The plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was significant increase in the frequency of IL-6 (-174) GG genotype (P < 0.05) and G allele (P < 0.01) compared to controls. A significant increase in the distribution of IL-10 (-1082G/A) GG (P < 0.05) and AA (P < 0.05) genotypes and a significant reduction in the frequency of GA genotype (P < 0.05) was found in SLE patients. The mean serum concentration of IL-6 (P < 0.001) and IL-10 (P < 0.001) was significantly elevated in SLE patients compared to healthy controls. There was no significant association of the most common clinical findings and IL-6 and IL-10 gene polymorphisms in SLE patients. In conclusion, our preliminary study indicated that both GG genotype and G allele of IL-6 (-174G/C) could be considered as risk factors for SLE. In addition, the polymorphisms at IL-10 (-1082 G/G and AA) may play a role in SLE susceptibility in Egyptian patients. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

In the present study, we have investigated the relationship between GDF15 gene variants and left ventricular hypertrophy in human essential hypertension. A community-based hypertensive population sample of 1527 individuals (506 men and 1021 women) was genotyped for three GDF15 genetic variants, including one tag variant -3148C>G (rs4808793) and two exonic variants +157A>T (rs1059369) and +2438C>G (rs1058587). The effects of those variants on gene expression were studied by use of luciferase reporter assays and the determination of plasma GDF15 levels. Only the tag variant -3148G was significantly associated with a lower risk of left ventricular hypertrophy [odds ratio=0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.89); P=0.0009]. Multiple regression analyses confirmed that -3148G predicted the decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (beta=-0.10, P=0.0001), end-systolic diameter (beta=-0.09, P=0.0007), mass (beta=-0.11, P<0.0001) and indexed mass (beta=-0.12, P<0.0001). These effects were independent of conventional factors, including gender, age, body surface area, blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. The transcription activity of the -3148G-containing construct was increased 1.45-fold (P=0.015) at baseline and 1.73-fold (P=0.008) after stimulation with phenylephrine when compared with the -3148C construct. The -3148G allele was also associated with a significant increase in the plasma GDF15 level in hypertensive subjects (P=0.04). In conclusion, the results show that a promoter haplotype containing the -3148G variant increases GDF15 transcription activity and is associated with favourable left ventricular remodelling in human essential hypertension.",

This syndrome is molecularly characterized by pathognomonic mutations in the LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator). Using whole genome sequencing (WGS) we attempted to identify novel mutations of CHS based on a family of CHS with atypical symptoms. The two patients demonstrated a phenotypic constellation including partial oculocutaneous albinism, frequency upper respiratory infection or a marginal intelligence, without bleeding tendency and severe immunodeficiency. WGS revealed two compound LYST mutations including a maternally inherited chr1:235969126G > A (rs80338652) and a novel paternally inherited chr1: 235915327A > AT, associated with autosomal recessive CHS. These two variants fall in the coding regions of LYST, resulting in premature truncation of LYST due to R1104X/N2535KfsX2 induced incomplete translation. Notably, the heterozygous carriers (i.e. parents) were unaffected. Our finding also reveals decreased plasma serotonin levels in patients with CHS compared with unaffected individuals for the first time. The present study contributes to improved understanding of the causes of this disease and provides new ideas for possible treatments.",

We investigated PZ levels and PROZ variants in a multi-ethnic case-control study of unexplained stroke in participants aged 18 to 64. Plasma PZ was measured in cases (\u22652 months post-stroke) and controls. PZ polymorphisms G79A (rs3024735) and A13G (2273971) were genotyped. A combined genetic score (0-4 minor alleles) was created assuming additive effects. A total of 715 individuals (1:1.4 cases:controls) was included. Analyses revealed evidence of a non-linear association. After adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, PZ levels >2.5 \u00b5g/ml (90<sup>th</sup> %ile) were significantly associated with cryptogenic stroke (OR 2.41 [95 % CI 1.34, 4.34]) as compared with lower levels. Higher genetic score was related to progressively lower levels of PZ, and the presence of four minor alleles was associated with lower odds of stroke (adjusted OR 0.26 [95 % CI 0.07, 0.96]) versus 0 minor alleles. In this multi-ethnic study of young and middle-aged adults, there was evidence of a non-linear positive association between PZ level and unexplained stroke, with a directionally consistent association for genetic variants related to PZ levels and cryptogenic stroke. These findings support elevated PZ levels as a risk factor for cryptogenic stroke.",

Although there is growing evidence implicating TLR7 and TLR9 in the detection of intracellular pathogenic bacteria, characterization of such a role for TLR8 is currently lacking. A recent genetic study has correlated the presence of a TLR8 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs3764880:A>G; p.Met1Val) with the development of active tuberculosis, suggesting a role for TLR8 in the detection of phagosomal bacteria. Here we provide the first direct evidence that TLR8 sensing is activated in human monocytic cells following Helicobacter pylori phagocytosis. In addition, we show that rs3764880 fine tunes translation of the two TLR8 main isoforms, without affecting protein function. Although we show that TLR8 variant 2 (TLR8v2) is the prevalent form of TLR8 contributing to TLR8 function, we also uncover a role for the TLR8 long isoform (TLR8v1) in the positive regulation of TLR8 function in CD16(+)CD14(+) differentiated monocytes. Thus, TLR8 sensing can be activated following bacterial phagocytosis, and rs3764880 may play a role in the modulation of TLR8-dependent microbicidal response of infected macrophages.",

                "text": "In light of current etiological concepts the glutamatergic system plays an essential role for the pathophysiology of the disorder, offering multiple options for new treatment strategies. The D-amino oxidase activator (DAOA) gene is closely connected to the glutamatergic system and its therapeutic and pathophysiological relevance for schizophrenia is therefore intensively debated. In a further step to shed light on the role of DAOA in schizophrenia, we aimed to investigate the association of the functional DAOA Arg30Lys (rs2391191) variant and cortical thickness in schizophrenia. Cortical thickness was computed by an automated surface-based technique (FreeSurfer) in 52 genotyped patients with schizophrenia and 42 healthy controls. Cortical thickness of the entire cortex was compared between risk carriers and non-risk carriers regarding the Arg30Lys polymorphism in patients and healthy controls on the basis of a node-by-node procedure and an automated clustering approach. Risk carriers with schizophrenia show significantly thinner cortex in two almost inversely arranged clusters on the left and right hemisphere comprising middle temporal, inferior parietal, and lateral occipital cortical areas. The clusters encompass an area of 1174 mm(2) (left) and 1156 mm(2) (right). No significant effect was observed in healthy controls.The finding of our study that the Arg30Lys risk variant is associated with a distinct cortical thinning provides new evidence for the pathophysiological impact of DAOA in schizophrenia. The affected areas are mostly confined to cortical regions with a crucial role in the ToM network and visual processing, which both can be influenced by glutamatergic modulation. Our finding thus underlines the importance of DAOA and related glutamatergic processes as a putative target for therapeutic interventions in schizophrenia.",

This study was designed to analyze the contribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the CDH1 (-160C/A) and Exo1 (K589E) to prostate cancer susceptibility in Bangladeshi population. The study included 100 prostate cancer cases and age-matched 100 healthy controls. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to determine the genetic polymorphisms. A significant association was found between CDH1 -160C/A (rs16260) and Exo1 (rs1047840, K589E) polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. In case of CDH1 -160C/A polymorphism, the frequencies of the three genotypes C/C,C/A, and A/A were 45%, 48%, and 7% in cases and 63%, 32%, and 5% in controls, respectively. The heterozygote C/A genotype and combined C/A + A/A genotypes showed 2.10-fold (odds ratio = 2.1000, 95% confidence interval = 1.2956-4.0905, p = 0.013) and 2.08-fold (odds ratio = 2.0811, 95% confidence interval = 1.1820-3.6641, p = 0.011) increased risk of prostate cancer, respectively, when compared with homozygous C/C genotypes. The variant A allele also was associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio = 1.6901, 95% confidence interval = 1.0740-2.6597, p = 0.0233). In case of Exo1 (K589E) polymorphism, G/A heterozygote, A/A homozygote, and combined G/A + A/A genotypes were found to be associated with 2.30-, 4.85-, and 3.04-fold higher risk of prostate cancer, respectively (odds ratio = 2.3021, 95% confidence interval = 2.956-4.0905, p = 0.0031; odds ratio = 4.8462, 95% confidence interval = 1.0198-23.0284, p = 0.0291; OR = 3.0362, 95% confidence interval = 1.7054-5.4053, p = 0.0001, respectively).

Genotypes for the MMP-2 C(-1306)T polymorphism and the MMP-9 C(-1562)T, 90(CA)(14-24) and Q279R polymorphisms (rs243865, rs3918242, rs2234681, and rs17576, respectively) were determined by TaqMan(\u00ae) Allele Discrimination assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction or restriction fragment length polymorphism. Alleles for the 90(CA)(14-24) polymorphism were grouped as low (L) when there were <21 and high (H) when there were \u226521 CA repeats. The plasma levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were determined by gelatin zymography. The software PHASE 2.1 was used to estimate the haplotypes frequencies. Although we found no effects of the MMP-9 C(-1562)T or the Q279R polymorphisms on MMP-9 levels, higher MMP-9 levels were associated with the HH genotype for the -90(CA)(14-24) polymorphism compared with the HL or LL genotypes. Lower MMP-9 levels were found in carriers of the CRL haplotype (combining the C, R, and L alleles for the MMP-9 polymorphisms) compared with the CRH haplotype. Consistent with this finding, the CRL haplotype was more commonly found in subjects with low MMP-9 levels. The MMP-2 C(-1306)T polymorphism had no effects on the plasma MMP-2 levels. Our results show that MMP-9 genetic variations modify MMP-9 levels in black subjects and may offer biochemical evidence implicating MMP-9 in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases in blacks.",
