                "text": "Peroxidases of the peroxiredoxin (Prx) family contain a Cys residue that is preceded by a conserved sequence in the NH(2)-terminal region . \nA new type of mammalian Prx, designated PrxV, has now been identified as the result of a data base search with this conserved Cys-containing sequence . \nThe 162-amino acid PrxV shares only approximately 10% sequence identity with previously identified mammalian Prx enzymes and contains Cys residues at positions 73 and 152 in addition to that (Cys(48)) corresponding to the conserved Cys . \nAnalysis of mutant human PrxV proteins in which each of these three Cys residues was individually replaced with serine suggested that the sulfhydryl group of Cys(48) is the site of oxidation by peroxides and that oxidized Cys(48) reacts with the sulfhydryl group of Cys(152) to form an intramolecular disulfide linkage . \nThe oxidized intermediate of PrxV is thus distinct from those of other Prx enzymes, which form either an intermolecular disulfide or a sulfenic acid intermediate . \nThe disulfide formed by PrxV is reduced by thioredoxin but not by glutaredoxin or glutathione . \nThus, PrxV mutants lacking Cys(48) or Cys(152) showed no detectable thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity, whereas mutation of Cys(73) had no effect on activity . \nImmunoblot analysis revealed that PrxV is widely expressed in rat tissues and cultured mammalian cells and is localized intracellularly to cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes . \nThe peroxidase function of PrxV in vivo was demonstrated by the observations that transient expression of the wild-type protein, but not that of the Cys(48) mutant, in NIH 3T3 cells inhibited H(2)O(2) accumulation and activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha . \n",

                "text": "Rabphilin and Noc2 were originally described as Rab3A effector proteins involved in the regulation of secretory vesicle exocytosis, however, recently both proteins have been shown to bind Rab27A in vitro in preference to Rab3A (Fukuda, M . \n(2003) J . \nBiol . \nChem . \n278, 15373-15380), suggesting that Rab3A is not their major ligand in vivo . \nIn the present study we showed by means of deletion and mutation analyses that rabphilin and Noc2 are recruited to dense-core vesicles through specific interaction with Rab27A, not with Rab3A, in PC12 cells . \nRab3A binding-defective mutants of rabphilin (E50A) and Noc2( E51A) were still localized in the distal portion of the neurites (where dense-core vesicles had accumulated) in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells, the same as the wild-type proteins, whereas Rab27A binding-defective mutants of rabphilin ( E50A/I54A) and Noc2( E51A/I55A) were present throughout the cytosol . \nWe further showed that expression of the wild-type or the E50A mutant of rabphilin-RBD, but not the E50A/I54A mutant of rabphilin-RBD, significantly inhibited high KCl-dependent neuropeptide Y secretion by PC12 cells . \nWe also found that rabphilin and its binding partner, Rab27 have been highly conserved during evolution (from nematoda to humans) and that Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila rabphilin (ce/dm-rabphilin) specifically interact with ce/dm-Rab27, but not with ce/dm-Rab3 or ce/dm-Rab8, suggesting that rabphilin functions as a Rab27 effector across phylogeny . \nBased on these findings, we propose that the N-terminal Rab binding domain of rabphilin and Noc2 be referred to as &quot;RBD27 (Rab binding domain for Rab27)&quot;, the same as the synaptotagmin-like protein homology domain (SHD) of Slac2-a/melanophilin . \n",
