                "text": "MEK1 mutations confer resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibition\tGenetic alterations that activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway occur commonly in cancer. For example, the majority of melanomas harbor mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which are predicted to confer enhanced sensitivity to pharmacologic MAP kinase inhibition (e.g., RAF or MEK inhibitors). We investigated the clinical relevance of MEK dependency in melanoma by massively parallel sequencing of resistant clones generated from a MEK1 random mutagenesis screen in vitro, as well as tumors obtained from relapsed patients following treatment with AZD6244, an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Most mutations conferring resistance to MEK inhibition in vitro populated the allosteric drug binding pocket or \u00a5\u00e1-helix C and showed robust (?100-fold) resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition. Other mutations affected MEK1 codons located within or abutting the N-terminal negative regulatory helix (helix A), which also undergo gain-of-function germline mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. One such mutation, MEK1(P124L), was identified in a resistant metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Both MEK1(P124L) and MEK1(Q56P), which disrupts helix A, conferred cross-resistance to PLX4720, a selective B-RAF inhibitor. However, exposing BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to AZD6244 and PLX4720 in combination prevented emergence of resistant clones. These results affirm the importance of MEK dependency in BRAF-mutant melanoma and suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibitors that may have important clinical implications. Approximately one-third of all cancers harbor genetic alterations that aberrantly upregulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent signal transduction (1). In the MAPK pathway, RAS oncoproteins activate RAF, MEK, and ERK kinases to direct key cell proliferative and survival signals. When rendered constitutively active by genetic mutation, the MAP kinase pathway is believed to confer \u00a1\u00b0oncogene dependency\u00a1\u00b1 (2), an excessive reliance on its dysregulated activity for tumor viability. Therefore, protein kinases within this signaling cascade offer promising targets for novel anticancer therapeutics. In melanoma, uncontrolled MAP kinase pathway activity is nearly ubiquitous and occurs most commonly through gain-of-function mutations involving codon 600 of the B-RAF kinase (3) (BRAF V600E; 50?70% of cases). Considerable preclinical evidence has associated the BRAF V600E mutation with heightened sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of RAF or MEK kinases (4, 5). Although early clinical trials of RAF and MEK inhibitors failed to show a substantial benefit (6, 7), recent phase I studies of selective RAF inhibitors have shown promising results in patients with BRAF-mutant tumors (8, 9). Thus, optimizing therapeutic efficacy while avoiding or bypassing the emergence of resistance to MAP kinase pathway inhibition will likely gain increasing importance in melanoma and other MAP kinase-driven cancers. Here, we describe the use of random mutagenesis and massively parallel sequencing to identify mutations within MEK kinase that promote resistance to pharmacologic MEK inhibition. This deep sequencing approach was also leveraged to interrogate melanomas derived from patients treated with the investigational MEK inhibitor AZD6244. Structural and functional characterization of the resulting MEK1 resistance mutations highlighted two major types of resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition, one of which confers cross-resistance to selective B-RAF inhibition. These results may therefore inform a clinical understanding of resistance to MEK and RAF inhibition, as well as approaches to prevent its emergence during targeted treatment. Results.  Comprehensive Identification of MEK1 Resistance Mutations in Vitro.. To begin to characterize resistance to MAP kinase pathway inhibition in the context of BRAF V600E melanoma, we used a random mutagenesis screen (10) together with massively parallel sequencing (11) to discover the spectrum of variants associated with resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition in vitro. We expressed a saturating cDNA library of MEK1 mutations in A375 melanoma cells, which harbor the BRAF V600E mutation and are highly sensitive to MEK inhibition. After culturing these cells for 4 weeks in the presence of a diarylamine MEK inhibitor (12, 13) (either 1.5 \u00a5\u00ecM AZD6244 or 2 \u00a5\u00ecM CI-1040), resistant clones emerged, ?1,000 of which were pooled and characterized en masse by massively parallel sequencing (SI Text for a full description). An additional 100 clones were sequenced by the Sanger method. A complete set of mutant MEK1 alleles and the methods of identification are listed in Table S1. This combined analysis of ?1,100 resistant clones vastly exceeded the scope of prior mutagenesis studies (14) and offered a comprehensive framework for unbiased characterization of MEK1-mediated drug resistance. The landscape of MEK1 mutations that emerged in the presence of AZD6244 is shown in Fig. 1A. Similar results were obtained from mutatgenesis experiments using CI-1040 (Fig. S1A). We investigated the distribution of candidate resistance alleles across each MEK1 nucleotide position and mapped the resulting amino acid substitutions within the three-dimensional structure of the full-length MEK1 kinase domain (15) (PDB code: 3EQC) (Fig. 1B; see also Fig. S1B for a larger view). Putative MEK1 resistance alleles segregated into two classes: \u00a1\u00b0primary\u00a1\u00b1 mutations clustering within or directly perturbing the allosteric binding pocket and \u00a1\u00b0secondary\u00a1\u00b1 mutations that resided outside of the drug binding region. Primary MEK1 resistance alleles could be further subdivided into mutations situated directly within the arylamine binding pocket (e.g., I99T, L115P/R, G128D, F129L, V211D, and L215P; Fig. 1C) and a distinct set located in the second protein shell, along and adjacent to the C helix (e.g., I103N, K104N, I111N, H119P, E120D, F133L; Fig. 1D). Notably, the MEK1 hydrophobic pocket includes residues from both \u00a5\u00e1-helix C and the activation loop. Binding of arylamine inhibitors within this pocket prevents the structural reorganization of \u00a5\u00e1-helix C and other motifs, which generates a catalytically active MEK1 conformation. Thus, primary mutations may cause resistance either by direct interference or through altered C helix conformation. The secondary class of resistance mutations populated two regions of MEK1. One region includes the N-terminal negative regulatory domain known as helix A (15) (e.g., Q56P) and a proline proximal to the C helix (P124) that abuts helix A (Fig. 1E). P124 mutations were identified either by Sanger sequencing of individual resistant clones (P124S) or by deep sequencing (P124Q), albeit at an average variant score that fell beneath the initial threshold for detection (Table S1). The proximity of Q56 and P124 to the N-terminal negative regulatory domain (Fig. 1 B and E) suggests a resistance mechanism that involves upregulation of intrinsic MEK1 kinase activity. Toward this end, the Q56P and P124S mutations closely mimic T55P and P124L, respectively?two germline variants observed in patients with cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome (15, 16) that confer aberrant MEK activation. The D67N mutation, which was identified in the CI-1040 mutagenesis screen (Fig. S1A), also occurs as a germline CFC variant (17) and has occasionally been detected as a somatic cancer mutation (18). The other secondary region involves the C-terminal kinase domain (e.g., G328R, P326L, and E368K); the functional significance of these mutations is currently unknown. On the basis of these findings, we reasoned that on-target resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition may arise through reduction of drug binding affinity or enhanced intrinsic MEK1 activation.  Functional Validation of MEK1 Resistance Alleles.. To confirm the functional effects of putative MEK1 resistance alleles identified by random mutagenesis, we introduced several representative mutations into the sequence of wild-type MEK1 and expressed the mutant cDNAs in parental A375 melanoma cells. All variant constructs were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. S1C). As expected, A375 cells expressing wild-type MEK1 (MEK-WT) or a constitutively active variant (MEK-DD) showed CI-1040 GI 50 values comparable to that of wild-type A375 cells (?100 nM; Fig. 2A). In contrast, all primary resistance alleles examined (I103N, L115P, F129L, and V211D) increased CI-1040 and AZD6244 GI 50 values by 50- to 1,000-fold (Fig. 2 A and B). The secondary resistance allele Q56P also conferred ?100-fold resistance to MEK inhibition (Fig. 2 A and B), whereas the effect of the P124S allele was significant but less pronounced (4- to 10-fold; Fig. 2 A and B and Table S2). The Q56P mutation also increased MEK kinase activity in vitro (Fig. S2). Several other resistance alleles had little effect on kinase activity in vitro (Fig. S2); however, subtle kinase effects in vivo cannot be excluded. Biochemical studies of MEK inhibition corroborated the pharmacologic results above. Treatment with CI-1040 or AZD6244 potently inhibited ERK phosphorylation (p-ERK) in both parental A375 cells and those expressing MEK-WT or MEK-DD, but this effect was markedly attenuated in cells expressing each resistant allele (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3A). The presence of MEK1 mutations strongly diminished both the magnitude and durability of MEK inhibition (Fig. S3B). In several instances, levels of MEK phosphorylation (p-MEK) increased at higher doses of MEK inhibitor (e.g., A375, MEK-WT, and MEK(V211D); Fig. 2C), consistent with modulation of feedback inhibition (19). Together, these results validated the functional relevance of MEK1 mutations identified by random mutagenesis.  An Acquired MEK1 Mutation in AZD6244-Resistant Melanoma.. To determine whether any aforementioned resistance mechanisms might influence the clinical response to MEK inhibition, we used targeted deep sequencing of tumors from melanoma patients treated with MEK inhibitors. We reasoned that MEK1 exons 3 and 6, which encompass the validated resistant alleles described above (Fig. 3A), might represent promising candidate loci for the clinical emergence of resistance to MEK inhibition. Accordingly, we characterized the MEK1 locus in tumor genomic DNA from advanced melanoma patients enrolled in a phase II clinical trial of AZD6244 (20). Table S3 summarizes the pertinent clinical characteristics of the patients examined. Seven patients were identified who experienced transient disease stabilization followed by relapse on AZD6244 (mean stable disease duration = 55 \u00a1\u00be 18 days in patients 1?6). Five patients contained lymph node or dermal metastases amenable to both pretreatment and postrelapse biopsy, and three harbored BRAF V600E melanomas. One patient with BRAF V600E melanoma (patient 7) experienced prolonged disease stabilization on AZD6244. MEK1 exons 3 and 6 were amplified by PCR using tumor genomic DNA from five patients who relapsed following MEK inhibitor treatment. All PCR products were pooled and subjected to massively parallel sequencing (see Experimental Procedures). This analysis identified a C \u00a1\u00e6 T transition in MEK1 exon 3 that encodes a P124L substitution (Fig. 3B). MEK1 codon 124 was implicated as a secondary resistance allele during the random mutagenesis screens, although alternative amino acid substitutions (P124S or P124Q) were selected. Sanger sequencing of individual pretreatment and postrelapse melanoma samples revealed that MEK1 P124L occurred in the postrelapse tumor DNA from patient 7 but was absent in the pretreatment tumor sample (Fig. 3C). This finding suggested that mutations within the drug target might provide a clinically relevant means of resistance to MEK inhibitors. The MEK1 P124L allele was identified in a 55-year-old male with metastatic melanoma, including pulmonary and skeletal involvement at the time of clinical trial enrollment. The patient was treated with oral temozolomide (435 mg per day) but developed progressive disease characterized by mediastinal lymph node enlargement and pulmonary infiltration (Fig. 3D). In accordance with protocol specifications, the patient was switched to the AZD6244 treatment arm. This resulted in regression or stabilization of all disease sites except for a left axillary lymph node metastasis, which expanded over a period of 16 weeks with a concomitant rise in the serum S100 tumor marker. Surgical removal of this metastasis led to a marked decrease in S100 levels; MEK1 P124L was detected in this specimen. Following resection, the patient continued on AZD6244 and showed prolonged disease stabilization (>44 weeks), including a steadily declining RECIST score and a 28% overall reduction in tumor burden (Fig. 3D).  Ex Vivo and Functional Analysis of MEK1(P124L).. To confirm the role of the P124L allele in resistance to MEK inhibition, we examined the effects of MEK inhibition on ex vivo melanoma cultures derived from the AZD6244-resistant metastasis of patient 7 (M307 cells). M307 cells were obtained from the left axillary lymph node at the same time as the postrelapse resection described above (see SI Text). The presence of MEK1 P124L in M307 was verified by Sanger sequencing (Fig. S4). The GI 50 for AZD6244 was 10?50 nM in treatment-naive BRAF V600E melanoma cultures (WM3482, WM3457, and WM3506) but exceeded 2 \u00a5\u00ecM in cells derived from the AZD6244-resistant metastasis (M307; Fig. 4A). Likewise, marked biochemical inhibition of p-ERK was achieved following a 16-hour exposure to ?400 nM AZD6244 in treatment-naive lines, but p-ERK remained robust in the resistant cells even at 10 \u00a5\u00ecM AZD6244 (Fig. 4B). Next, we introduced recombinant MEK1(P124L) into parental A375 cells and examined pharmacological resistance to MEK inhibition. As observed with the MEK1(P124S) allele above, MEK1(P124L) expression resulted in an ?5-fold increase in AZD6244 GI 50 when compared to A375, MEK-WT, or MEK-DD (Fig. 4C). Similarly, MEK1(P124L) conferred sustained p-ERK expression following exposure to varying concentrations of MEK inhibitor, with measureable p-ERK even at 2 \u00a5\u00ecM of AZD6244 (Fig. 4D). In contrast, parental A375 cells and those expressing MEK-WT and MEK-DD showed diminished p-ERK levels even at the lowest drug concentration (80 nM; Fig. 4D).  Secondary MEK1 Mutations Confer Cross-Resistance to B-RAF Inhibition.. Given the high prevalence of oncogenic BRAF mutations in melanoma, several RAF inhibitors have entered clinical trials (8, 9, 21). To determine whether MEK1 mutations confer cross-resistance to RAF inhibition, we examined the effects of the selective B-RAF inhibitor PLX4720 (21) in the cultured melanoma lines described above. AZD6244-resistant primary melanoma cells (M307) demonstrated profound cross-resistance to PLX4720, with a GI 50 value of >10 \u00a5\u00ecM compared to 5?10 nM in treatment-naive lines (Fig. 5A). These findings were reflected in biochemical studies of p-MEK following B-RAF inhibition (Fig. S5A). In general, expression of primary MEK1 resistance alleles identified in vitro only modestly affected the PLX4720 GI 50 in A375 cells (Fig. 5B and Table S2). However, the P124L and P124S mutations conferred a two- to threefold resistance relative to wild-type MEK1 (approximately three- to fourfold resistance compared to parental A375), and the Q56P mutation conferred robust resistance (>50-fold) to PLX4720, comparable to the MEK(DD) allele (Fig. 5B and Table S2). Levels of p-MEK following PLX4720 treatment showed comparable reduction across all MEK1 resistance alleles (Fig. S5B). Overall, these results indicated that clinically relevant MEK1 resistance mutations may confer cross-resistance to B-RAF inhibition.  Combined B-RAF and MEK Inhibition Prevents the Emergence of Resistant Clones.. Finally, we tested whether the stringency of MAP kinase pathway inhibition might influence the emergence of on-target resistance variants. A375 melanoma cells expressing empty vector or various derivatives were cultured for up to 4 weeks in the presence of varying doses of AZD6244 or PLX4720 singly or in combination, and colony formation was monitored (see Materials and Methods). Exposure to AZD6244 completely suppressed the growth of parental A375 cells and those expressing empty vector or MEK(DD) at all concentrations examined (Fig. 5C). Expression of wild-type MEK1 resulted in low-level breakthrough growth under these conditions (Fig. S6; see SI Text), but only marginally affected MEK inhibitor GI 50 values compared to parental A375 (Table S2). In contrast, expression of MEK1(P124L) resulted in numerous resistant colonies at 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecM and 0.25 \u00a5\u00ecM of AZD6244 (Fig. 5C). As expected, cells expressing the mutagenized MEK1-cDNA library that was used in the primary resistance screens formed some AZD6244-resistant colonies at all concentrations tested (Fig. S6). As with AZD6244, the B-RAF inhibitor PLX4720 also suppressed the growth of wild-type and empty vector-expressing A375 melanoma cells. On the other hand, MEK1(P124L) expression yielded PLX4720-resistant colonies at all concentrations tested (Fig. 5C and Fig. S6). In this assay, the magnitude of MEK1(P124L)-mediated resistance to B-RAF inhibition approached that seen following MEK(DD) expression (Fig. 5C and Fig. S6). These results complemented the MEK1(P124L) growth inhibition studies above. Strikingly, however, combined exposure to both AZD6244 and PLX4720 potently suppressed the emergence of resistant variants at 0.5?1.5 \u00a5\u00ecM of each compound (Fig. 5C and Fig. S6). These results raised the possibility that combined RAF and MEK inhibition might circumvent acquired resistance to targeted therapeutics directed against the MAP kinase pathway. Discussion. Tumors harboring a \u00a1\u00b0druggable\u00a1\u00b1 oncogene dependency often develop on-target clinical resistance through point mutation or genomic amplification of the target locus (22?24). Elaboration of such resistance mechanisms has enabled the design of second-generation inhibitors with enhanced potency against a range of resistant variants (25, 26). In this study, we used a systematic approach that combined random mutagenesis and massively parallel sequencing to characterize on-target resistance to MEK inhibition in melanoma. Most MEK1 resistance alleles that emerged from in vitro screens populate the allosteric drug binding pocket adjacent to the ATP binding motif or the second protein shell situated within or near helix C. Arylamine MEK inhibitors function by locking the kinase into a \u00a1\u00b0closed\u00a1\u00b1 inactive conformation, in which the activation loop causes helix C to become externally rotated and displaced (27). Thus, primary MEK1 mutations may introduce resistance through direct interference of drug binding or by forcing helix C toward a closed conformation that disrupts the binding pocket. Conceivably, the design of ATP-competitive inhibitors, which have proved successful in tyrosine kinase-driven cancers, may offer one approach to override resistance to non-ATP-competitive kinase inhibition. Numerous candidate MEK1 resistance alleles identified in vitro reside outside of the drug binding pocket, localizing to regions such as the C-terminal kinase domain or the interface between helix A and the core kinase domain (15). Notably, several such secondary mutations correspond closely to missense germline variants that are observed in CFC syndrome (28). This disorder is characterized by mental retardation as well as cardiac and facial abnormalities and results from aberrant MAP kinase signaling during development. Consistent with the fact that several CFC alleles are known to enhance MEK kinase activity, the Q56P and P124S/L mutations demonstrated a substantial resistance phenotype as measured by pharmacologic growth inhibition studies. These mutations may modulate intrinsic MEK kinase activity in a manner that becomes expressly manifest in vivo during prolonged exposure to arylamine MEK inhibition. Guided by resistance alleles identified in vitro, we analyzed the MEK1 locus in melanoma patients who relapsed during treatment with the small-molecule MEK inhibitor AZD6244. These studies identified the MEK1 P124L mutation in a metastatic focus that progressed in the context of otherwise stable disease on AZD6244. The proline residue at codon 124 is uniquely positioned such that it may exert an indirect influence on helix C conformation while also interfacing directly with helix A, a negative regulatory motif whose crystal structure was recently solved (15). We speculate that mutation of this proline may disrupt a key regulatory interaction between helix A and the rest of the kinase, while simultaneously altering helix C indirectly through loss of a turn motif proximal to this segment. These results illuminate clinical mechanisms of resistance to both MEK and B-RAF inhibition and may inform rational therapeutic approaches to target this prominent tumor dependency. More generally, this work also highlights the power of systematic tumor tissue procurement both before treatment and following relapse in clinical trials of targeted anticancer agents. The clinical emergence of a resistant MEK1 mutation in metastatic BRAF V600E melanoma suggests that the prior failure of first-generation RAF or MEK inhibitors to elicit meaningful tumor responses in many BRAF V600E melanomas may have resulted at least in part from suboptimal drug potency or pharmacodynamics in vivo. This notion is supported by recent phase I clinical trial results using selective RAF inhibitors, in which favorable drug pharmacodynamics correlated strongly with clinical response (8, 9). Whether the MEK dependency observed in BRAF-mutant melanomas is manifest in other MAP kinase-driven contexts remains an open question. Preclinical studies suggest that some NRAS-mutant melanomas may also exhibit sensitivity to RAF or MEK inhibition (4, 29), whereas KRAS mutations have conferred only marginal sensitivity (30). These findings may point to the future need to target multiple cellular pathways simultaneously (e.g., combined MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathway blockade). On the other hand, combined pharmacologic blockade within the MAPK pathway may suppress the emergence of on-target resistance in tumors harboring the BRAF V600E mutation. Finally, these findings highlight the increasing importance of tumor genomic profiling to guide patient selection in clinical trials of targeted therapeutics (31). The presence of BRAF mutations is expected to denote patient subpopulations whose tumors are enriched for RAF/MEK dependency. In the future, profiling BRAF-mutant melanomas for genetic alterations affecting MEK1 (and conceivably MEK2) in cases where resistance emerges may be required both to determine the mechanism of resistance and to specify optimal salvage therapy. Robust diagnostic approaches to stratify patients on the basis of tumor genotype and to identify clinically pertinent resistance mechanisms should speed the advent of \u00a1\u00b0personalized\u00a1\u00b1 cancer treatment.

                "text": "Aurora-A Phosphorylates, Activates, and Relocalizes the Small GTPase RalA \u00a2\u00d3\tThe small GTPase Ras, which transmits extracellular signals to the cell, and the kinase Aurora-A, which promotes proper mitosis, can both be inappropriately activated in human tumors. Here, we show that Aurora-A in conjunction with oncogenic Ras enhances transformed cell growth. Furthermore, such transformation and in some cases also tumorigenesis depend upon S194 of RalA, a known Aurora-A phosphorylation site. Aurora-A promotes not only RalA activation but also translocation from the plasma membrane and activation of the effector protein RalBP1. Taken together, these data suggest that Aurora-A may converge upon oncogenic Ras signaling through RalA. Ras small GTPases (H-, N-, and K-Ras) function as regulated binary switches, typically at the plasma membrane, whereby extracellular signal-stimulated cell surface receptors stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) to promote GDP/GTP exchange to favor the formation of active, GTP-bound Ras. This, in turn, induces a conformational change in the effector binding domain in Ras, permitting the binding and activation of effector proteins, such as Raf proteins, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and RalGEF proteins, that mediate Ras signaling (19, 53). One-third of human cancers harbor point mutations in Ras that render the protein in a constitutively active GTP-bound state, promoting a host of cancer cell phenotypes (40). Aurora-A belongs to a family of three related serine/threonine mitotic kinases critical for many stages of mitosis. Studies of a number of model systems indicate that Aurora-A phosphorylates a growing number of proteins in a spatially and temporally restricted manner to ensure proper centrosomal maturation and separation, mitotic entry, mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and separation, and subsequent cytokinesis (18, 42). Overexpression of Aurora-A is seen in human cancers (22, 31, 32) and can cause growth transformation of Rat1 and NIH 3T3 rodent fibroblast cell lines (5). That it can cause tumor formation in the mammary epithelia of mice only after a long latency (60, 68) and that alone it does not transform primary rodent cells (1) or induce pancreatic cancer formation in mice (61) argue that Aurora-A acts in concert with other changes to promote a transformed state. Although the mechanism by which Aurora-A promotes oncogenesis remains to be understood, emerging evidence suggests that Aurora-A may cooperate with the Ras oncoprotein. First, activating mutations in KRAS occur in nearly all pancreatic cancers (28), and Aurora-A has been found to be overexpressed in this tumor type by gene amplification (21) or by elevated levels of mRNA or protein (21, 35). This overexpression likely fosters tumor growth, as suppression of Aurora-A expression by interfering RNA or treatment with Aurora-A inhibitors also impairs pancreatic cancer cell growth (26, 48). Second, overexpression of Aurora-A enhances Ras-induced transformation of murine 3T3A31-1 fibroblasts (59). Third, Aurora kinases physically interact with RasGAP in vitro (23), and inhibition of Aurora-B binding to RasGAP causes apoptosis (49). Fourth, two components of the RalGEF-Ral effector pathway of Ras, which is known to promote Ras oncogenesis (38), are substrates for Aurora-A (66). Specifically, active Ras binds to RalGEF proteins, a family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and activators of the related small GTPases RalA and RalB. Both the RalGEF protein RalGDS and RalA were shown to be phosphorylated by Aurora-A. With regard to the latter, RalA is phosphorylated at S194 in its C-terminal membrane binding domain, leading to elevated levels of activated RalA-GTP. Constitutively active RalA (G23V) also cooperated with ectopically expressed Aurora-A to promote anchorage-independent growth of MDCK epithelial cells, whereas a RalA mutant that could not be phosphorylated by Aurora-A (RalA G23V,S194A) was impaired in this activity (66). Moreover, overexpression of both Aurora-A and RalA mRNA is associated with advanced human bladder cancer (58). Finally, as indirect evidence for the importance of the Aurora-A phosphorylation site in RalA, S194 and S183 were identified as sites of dephosphorylation by the phosphatase PP2A. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) silencing of PP2A expression increased phosphorylation of S194 and S183 and formation of RalA-GTP, whereas replacing endogenous RalA with S194A or S183A mutants resulted in a loss of tumorigenic growth of human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing oncogenic H-Ras, hTERT, and the early region of simian virus 40 (SV40) (56). Given these observations, we explored the molecular connection between Aurora-A and the Ras-RalGEF-RalA pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS.  Plasmids.. pSuper-Retro-Puro plasmids encoding shRNA against RalA, RalB, RalBP1 (5\u00a1\u00c7-GTAGAGAGGACCATGATGT), or a scramble sequence; pBabe-Neo plasmid encoding shRNA-resistant Myc-tagged RalA; pBabe-Puro plasmid encoding shRNA-resistant Flag-tagged RalA or Q72L; pBabe-Bleo plasmid encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Rlf-CAAX; pBabe-Puro Ras G12V and derived effector mutants; small t antigen (t-Ag); DsRed-Rab11; pMT3-mycRalBP1; and pcDNA3-mycSec5 were previously described (16, 25, 36, 45). S194A and S194D point mutations in RalA were introduced to pBabe-Neo and pBabe-puro plasmids encoding shRNA-resistant RalA, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis, and a Myc epitope tag (9E10) or a Flag epitope tag was added to the N terminus by PCR. Human Aurora-A was PCR amplified from a cDNA template (MGC-1605; ATCC) to add an N-terminal HA-epitope tag, after which K162R and T288D mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Resultant wild-type (WT), K162R, and T288D cDNAs were cloned into pBabe-Bleo or pBabe-Hygro for stable expression and pCGN for transient expression. shRNA directed against Aurora-A (5\u00a1\u00c7-ATGCCCTGTCTTACTGTCA) was subcloned into pSuper-Retro-Puro-TET. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-RalA fusion proteins were generated by subcloning wild-type RalA, RalA S194A, RalA S194D, and RalA D49N in frame to the C terminus of GFP in pEGFP-C2.  HEK-TtH cells, 293 cells, human pancreatic cancer cell lines and derived cell lines, inducible Aurora-A shRNA HPAC cells, and tissue samples.. HEK-TtH cells (human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing the SV40 early region and hTERT) were previously described (24). 293, 293T, AsPC-1, HPAC, HPAF-II, PANC-1, SW1990, Capan-1, Capan-2, CFPAC-1, and MIA PaCa-2 (38) were purchased and cultured as suggested by supplier (ATCC), and T3M4 cells were kindly provided by M. Korc (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Hanover, NH). Where noted, these cell lines were stably infected with retroviruses encoding the indicated shRNAs or transgenes as previously described (47). Generation of HPAC cells expressing inducible Aurora-A shRNA was done as described previously (37) except that a pSuper-Retro-Puro-TET plasmid (37) engineered to encode Aurora-A shRNA (26) was used and, at the indicated times, the cells were treated with either 60 mg/ml of doxycycline (Sigma) or a vehicle. Frozen surgical samples of normal human pancreatic tissues were kindly provided by A. D. Proia and D. Tyler (DUMC).  Immunoblotting.. Whole-cell lysates isolated in Triton X-100 lysis buffer from cultured cells (serum starved for 48 h for measurement of Ras effector pathways) or isolated in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer from tissue material were immunoblotted with the following antibodies, diluted according to the manufacturers' recommendations: antiactin, anti-RalBP1 (Santa Cruz), anti-RalA, anti-RalB (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-Aurora-A (Cell Signaling Technology), and antitubulin (Sigma) (to detect endogenous actin, RalBP1, RalA, RalB, Aurora-A, and tubulin proteins, respectively) and anti-HA (Roche), anti-Myc 9E10 (Invitrogen), anti-RalA (BD Transduction Laboratories) and anti-pan-Ras (Santa Cruz) (to detect the ectopic proteins HA-Aurora-A WT, HA-Aurora-A T288D, HA-Aurora-A K162R, HA-Rlf-CAAX, shRNA-resistant RalA [wild type, S194A, or S194D], and H-Ras or effector domain mutants, respectively).  Immunoprecipitation.. Whole-cell lysates prepared in Triton X-100 buffer from 293T cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG epitope-tagged RalA (wild type or S194D) and Myc-RalBP1 or Myc-Sec5 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 resin (Sigma) and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) to detect FLAG-RalA and anti-Myc 9E10 (Invitrogen) to detect Myc-RalBP1 or Myc-Sec5. To detect phosphorylated RalA, cells expressing a vector control or HA-tagged Aurora-A were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RalA antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) and immunoblotted with antiphosphoserine (4A4; Millipore) to detect serine-phosphorylated RalA. For detection of endogenous GTP-bound small GTPases, GTP-RalA, GTP-Cdc42, and GTP-Rac1 were captured for pulldown analyses by incubating cell lysates with glutathione-agarose-bound recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RalBD for RalA or GST-PakBD for Cdc42 and Rac1 and detected with the anti-RalA, anti-Cdc42, and anti-Rac1 antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories), respectively, as previously described (4, 65). The total amount of the corresponding small GTPase in the whole-cell lysate served as a loading control.  Soft agar assay.. Fifty thousand cells per 35-mm plate with a 2-mm grid were suspended in soft agar as described previously (17, 25). In the case of comparing Ras G12V-transformed HEK-TtH cells in the absence or presence of HA-Aurora-A WT, HA-Aurora-A K162R, or HA-Aurora-A T288D, 10 4 cells were seeded for analysis. Colonies with >30 cells were scored after 5 weeks. Assays were done in triplicate and two to three times independently.  Isolation of internal membrane fractions.. Internal membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (8). Briefly, cells were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. Extract was centrifuged at 750 \u00a1\u00bf g to pellet nuclei, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 \u00a1\u00bf g to pellet the crude membrane fraction. The crude membrane fraction was resuspended in MIB (250 mM sucrose, 40 mM KCl, 40 mM succinate, 40 mM HEPES, 20 mM EGTA, 800 mM mannitol) and layered over a discontinuous Percoll gradient composed of 42%, 37%, 30%, and 25% Percoll prepared in MIB. Percoll gradients were centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 25 min in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor with the brake off. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-rich internal membrane fraction sedimented between the 25% and 30% bands.  Xenograft tumorigenesis assay.. Cells (10 7) mixed with Matrigel were injected subcutaneously into both flanks of SCID/beige mice (Charles River Laboratory), with four injection sites per cell line, and tumor volumes were determined twice per week and calculated as (length/2) 2 \u00a1\u00bf width. These experiments were approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  Immunofluorescence.. The described cells were plated on glass microslides the previous day, fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-RalA or anti-RalB (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-Myc 9E10 (Invitrogen), and/or EEA1 (BD Transduction Laboratories) primary antibodies, followed by incubation with the anti-mouse Alexa-488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) or Texas Red-phalloidin to detect endogenous RalA, RalB, actin, or ectopic Myc-tagged proteins as previously described (36). For visualization of transiently expressed GFP fusion proteins, HEK-TtH cells on glass microslides transfected with GFP-RalA fusion proteins with or without HA-tagged Aurora-A (WT, K162R, or T288D) and Myc-tagged RalBP1 or Sec5 were fixed, mounted, and visualized by confocal microscopy. A Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope, an Olympus Fluoview 300 laser scanning confocal imaging system configured with an IX70 fluorescence microscope fitted with a PlanApo 60\u00a1\u00bf oil objective, or a Leica DMI6000CS scanning confocal imaging system fitted with a Leica Plan Apochromat 100\u00a1\u00bf/1.4- to 0.70-numerical-aperture oil objective was used for imaging. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION.  Aurora-A T288D cooperates with the RalGEF pathway to promote Ras-mediated transformation.. Both oncogenic Ras mutations (7) and overexpression of Aurora-A occur in human cancers (22, 31), such as pancreatic cancer (27, 28, 35). In experimental systems, overexpression of Aurora-A enhanced Ras- and RalA-induced transformation of a murine cell line (59) and a canine cell line (66), respectively. Given this functional association between Ras oncogenic signaling and Aurora-A activation, we tested whether Aurora-A also enhances Ras-mediated transformation of human cells. For these experiments, we utilized HEK-TtH cells (normal HEK cells immortalized and rendered sensitive to Ras transformation by ectopic expression of the SV40 early region encoding large T and small t antigens and of the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT) (24, 33). As these cells depend upon oncogenic Ras for tumorigenesis, and the other genetic changes required for tumorigenesis are known, Ras-transformed HEK-TtH cells provide a simplified, genetically defined, and malleable system for dissecting the relationship between Aurora-A and oncogenic Ras in transformation and tumorigenesis of human cells. HEK-TtH cells were stably infected with a retrovirus either encoding a constitutively activated T288D mutant (5) of human Aurora-A (Aurora-A T288D) or carrying no transgene, in the absence or presence of oncogenic (G12V) H-Ras (Ras G12V). Cell lines were verified to express the appropriate transgenes, as assessed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. ?(Fig.1A),1A), and assayed for growth in soft agar as a measure of transformation. We found that activated Aurora-A T288D alone could not promote transformation of these cells in the absence of oncogenic Ras (Fig. ?(Fig.1B)1B) but that Aurora-A T288D enhanced oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation twofold (Fig. ?(Fig.1B).1B). These results indicated that the cooperative activity of Aurora-A and Ras signaling to promote growth transformation observed previously in murine fibroblast (59) and canine epithelial (66) cell lines can be extended to human cells. To explore at what point Aurora-A may converge upon oncogenic Ras signaling, we tested whether Aurora-A cooperated with a specific Ras effector pathway to promote transformation. We focused our analyses on the three major Ras effectors involved in oncogenesis (Raf, PI3K, and RalGEF) by using oncogenic H-Ras effector domain mutants Ras G12V,T35S, Ras G12V,E37G, and Ras G12V,Y40C, which retain preferential activation of the Raf, RalGEF, and PI3K pathways, respectively (34, 54, 62, 64). Kinase-active Aurora-A T288D or an empty vector as a negative control was therefore expressed in HEK-TtH cells in conjunction with no transgene or a transgene encoding each Ras effector domain mutant. Appropriate expression of Aurora-A T288D and the Ras G12V effector mutants was verified by immunoblot analysis (Fig. ?(Fig.1A),1A), and the resultant six cell lines in addition to vector controls were assayed for anchorage-independent growth. As previously reported (25), activation of the RalGEF pathway, but not the PI3K or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, promoted the growth of these cells in soft agar. Addition of kinase-active Aurora-A T288D did not endow anchorage-independent growth to either vector control cells or cells expressing Ras mutants activating the Raf or PI3K pathways but did enhance twofold the transformed growth of cells expressing Ras G12V,E37G (Fig. ?(Fig.1C).1C). Thus, Aurora-A cooperates synergistically with the RalGEF signaling arm of oncogenic Ras in cellular transformation. To further validate these results, we tested whether Aurora-A similarly enhanced transformation of cells expressing an activated variant of the RalGEF protein Rlf/Rgl2 (Rlf-CAAX) (63) in place of Ras G12V,E37G. Specifically, HEK-TtH cells were engineered to coexpress both Rlf-CAAX and Aurora-A T288D proteins, or, as a negative or positive control, an empty vector or Rlf-CAAX, respectively. Appropriate transgene expression was verified by immunoblot analysis (Fig. ?(Fig.1D).1D). As expected, negative-control vector cells did not grow in soft agar, whereas the addition of Rlf-CAAX promoted transformed cell growth (Fig. ?(Fig.1E).1E). In agreement with the ability of activated Aurora-A T288D to enhance transformation by Ras G12V,E37G, cells expressing both the activated Rlf-CAAX and Aurora-A T288D proteins grew more robustly in soft agar (Fig. ?(Fig.1E).1E). We next tested whether the kinase activity of Aurora-A was required to enhance RalGEF-mediated transformation by expressing a kinase-inactive mutant of Aurora-A K162R (5) in Rlf-CAAX-transformed cells (Fig. ?(Fig.1D).1D). Whereas kinase-active Aurora-A T288D enhanced RalGEF-mediated transformation, the kinase-inactive Aurora-A K162R protein inhibited growth in soft agar (Fig. ?(Fig.1E).1E). Thus, Aurora-A enhances Ras-RalGEF signaling to promote cellular transformation.  Aurora-A T288D-induced increase in RalGEF-induced transformation of human cells is lost upon mutation of the Aurora-A phosphorylation site S194 of RalA.. RalGEF proteins activate the RalA and RalB isoforms of Ral GTPases, which are related both structurally (82% sequence identity) and biochemically. Despite these similarities, however, the proteins have distinct roles in oncogenesis. Whereas RalA is required for Ras-mediated anchorage-independent growth (36, 38), RalB can instead be critical to cell viability, at least in some contexts (14, 15), particularly when cells are grown in the absence of substrate or during metastasis (38). The primary sequence differences between RalA and RalB are concentrated in their C-terminal-30-residue membrane-targeting sequences in the hypervariable domain (20), which have been shown to contribute to some of the functional differences described above (36). Upstream of the C-terminal CAAX tetrapeptide motif that signals for posttranslational modification by a geranylgeranyl isoprenoid required for membrane association, these divergent sequences target RalA to the plasma membrane and late endosomes but target RalB to the plasma membrane only (57). Aurora-A phosphorylates this C-terminal region at a serine residue, S194, found in RalA but not in RalB (66), and mutating this site inhibited the ability of an overexpressed and constitutively activated RalA mutant (G23V) to cooperate with ectopically expressed Aurora-A to promote the transformed growth of a canine cell line (66). Conversely, knockdown of PP2A A\u00a5\u00e2 in HEK cells expressing T-Ag, hTERT, and oncogenic Ras resulted in elevated phosphorylation of S183 and S194 of RalA, and when RalA was also knocked down in these cells, they were able to form tumors upon restoration with ectopic wild-type RalA but not with an S194A mutant version (56). Consistent with these observations, we found that endogenous RalA is phosphorylated at serines in both human 293T and HEK TtH cells (Fig. ?(Fig.2A),2A), likely owing to expression of t-Ag in these cells (56), and that ectopically expressed wild-type Aurora-A increased the level of this phosphorylation (Fig. ?(Fig.2A).2A). Similarly, we found that the Aurora-A T288D-mediated enhancement of RalGEF-mediated transformation of HEK-TtH cells requires phosphorylation of RalA at S194. First, in HEK-TtH cells stably expressing both activated Rlf-CAAX and Aurora-A T288D proteins, expression of endogenous RalA protein was stably knocked down by shRNA, as assessed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. ?(Fig.2B).2B). Next, the loss of RalA expression was then complemented by a vector either carrying no transgene (negative control) or encoding an shRNA-resistant RalA protein in the wild-type (positive control) or S194A mutant (66) configuration, as assessed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. ?(Fig.2B).2B). As expected (36), knockdown of RalA was found to reduce transformed cell growth in soft agar to the level of cells not transfected with activated RalGEF and Aurora-A. This loss of transformation was rescued, almost to the level of the positive control scramble control cells, by expression of shRNA-resistant wild-type RalA but not the S194A mutant of RalA (Fig. ?(Fig.2C).2C). Lastly, the Aurora-A T288D-enhanced transformation of Rlf-CAAX-expressing cells was not reduced upon knockdown of RalB (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), which lacks the Aurora-A phosphorylation site (66). Thus, Aurora-A T288D enhancement of RalGEF-mediated transformation is lost specifically upon mutation of the Aurora-A substrate S194 of RalA.  RalA S194 is required for transformed growth of human pancreatic cancer cell lines.. RalA is frequently activated in pancreatic cancers and is essential for transformed growth of pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo (38). Aurora-A protein is similarly overexpressed in this disease (35). Aurora-A and RalA mRNA overexpression is also associated with advanced human bladder cancer (58). Indeed, we detected elevated levels of this kinase in a panel of 10 KRAS mutation-positive pancreatic carcinoma cells, compared to the level for normal pancreatic cancer tissues, whereas the total protein levels of RalA did not differ between tumor cells and normal tissue (Fig. ?(Fig.3A).3A). Thus, while RalA is upregulated at the level of protein activation (36, 38), Aurora-A is upregulated at the level of protein expression in pancreatic cancer cells. Given this correlation and the requirement of S194 of RalA for transformed or tumorigenic growth of canine (66), human HEK-TER (56), and HEK-TtH (Fig. ?(Fig.2C)2C) cells, we tested whether S194 is also required for tumorigenic growth of human pancreatic cells. Specifically, a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines, including AsPC-1, HPAC, HPAF-II, Panc-1, SW1990, Capan-1, CFPac-1, MIA PaCa-2, and T3M4 cells, were stably infected with a retrovirus encoding RalA shRNA or a scramble control, after which the RalA knocked-down cell lines were complemented by infection with retroviruses encoding shRNA-resistant forms of either wild-type RalA or the RalA S194A mutant. Immunoblot analysis verified appropriate knockdown of endogenous RalA and subsequent reexpression of the shRNA-resistant forms of RalA at levels roughly similar to that of endogenous RalA in all nine cell lines (Fig. ?(Fig.3B).3B). All 36 cell lines were then assayed for anchorage-independent growth. Consistent with the known role of RalA in transformation (36, 38), knockdown of RalA expression significantly impaired the anchorage-independent growth of all nine parental cell lines, ranging from 55% to 90% decrease in colony numbers. This decrease in transformed growth was, in large part, overcome by ectopic expression of the shRNA-resistant wild-type RalA protein. However, expression of a protein that was exactly the same except that it harbored the single point mutation at S194A that renders RalA resistant to Aurora-A phosphorylation extinguished the ability of RalA to rescue the loss of endogenous RalA and restore transformed cell growth in each of the nine cell lines (Fig. ?(Fig.3C).3C). Based on these data, S194 appears to be broadly required for RalA promotion of anchorage-independent proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells.  RalA S194 is required for tumorigenic growth of some human pancreatic cancer cell lines.. Since RalA is critical for tumorigenic growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vivo (38), we next determined whether S194 is also required for tumorigenesis of such cells. The CFPac-1, HPAC, and Capan-1 cell lines, which exhibit differing levels of RalA-GTP (Fig. ?(Fig.4A),4A), were engineered to stably express scramble control shRNA, RalA shRNA, or a RalA protein resistant to RalA shRNA in either the wild-type or the S194A mutant configuration. These lines were injected subcutaneously into both flanks of immunocompromised mice. Compared to what was found for scramble control cells, loss of RalA prolonged the latency period of tumorigenesis at least twofold and impeded subsequent tumor growth in all three pancreatic cancer lines (Fig. 4B and C). In Capan-1 and HPAC cells, which have prominent RalA-GTP (Fig. ?(Fig.4A),4A), RalA S194A was defective in restoring tumor growth to the same level as wild-type RalA (Fig. 4B and C), whereas in CFPac-1 cells, with weak RalA-GTP, wild-type and S194A RalA proteins were equally effective. The finding that RalA S194A did not rescue soft agar growth (Fig. ?(Fig.3C)3C) but did rescue tumor growth of CFPac1 cells treated with RalA shRNA (Fig. 4B and C) suggests that RalA, but not Aurora-A, may be required for tumor growth. Whether there is an inverse correlation between the level of RalA-GTP (Fig. ?(Fig.4A)4A) and the degree of tumor growth restoration by RalA S194A versus wild-type RalA (Fig. 4B and C) or this is simply a coincidence remains to be determined. If the former is the case, this occurrence may reflect the possibility that cells with higher basal levels of RalA-GTP are more dependent for tumorigenicity on RalA function and are therefore more sensitive to perturbations in RalA modulation. If the latter is the case, the variability observed may simply mean that not all oncogenic Ras-driven cancer cells equally require Aurora-A phosphorylation of RalA to promote tumorigenesis.  Aurora-A T288D promotes the translocation of endogenous RalA from the plasma membrane.. The C-terminal hypervariable domain of RalA, but not RalB, contains the S194 Aurora-A phosphorylation site, and the hypervariable regions of both proteins are known to account for the partially overlapping but distinct subcellular membrane localization patterns of the two proteins (36, 57). Further, phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) of a similarly situated C-terminal serine in K-Ras4B (S181) can induce translocation of K-Ras4B from the plasma membrane to internal organelles (6). Given these observations, we speculated that in addition to its role in activating RalA (66), Aurora-A may alter the subcellular location of RalA. To address this possibility, we monitored the subcellular localization of endogenous RalA in both gain (ectopic Aurora-A)- and loss (Aurora-A shRNA)-of-function situations. In the gain-of-function approach, the subcellular distribution of endogenous RalA was first assessed by immunofluorescence in HEK-TtH cells. In cells that stably expressed either empty vector or kinase-inactive Aurora-A K162R, endogenous RalA was found abundantly at the plasma membrane as well as throughout the cytoplasm and at internal membranes. However, in cells expressing kinase-active Aurora-A T288D, there was a clear loss of RalA at the plasma membrane and a concomitant increase in the internal pool of protein (Fig. ?(Fig.5A),5A), and some RalA colocalized with Rab11 and EEA1, markers of recycling endosomes and early endosomes, respectively (not shown). This effect of Aurora-A kinase activity on accumulation of RalA on internal membranes was borne out by biochemical fractionation. Specifically, in the presence of kinase-active Aurora-A T288D, RalA was greatly enriched in the isolated internal membrane fraction (defined by high levels of the ER-resident protein calnexin), compared to the amount seen in that fraction in the presence of kinase-inactive Aurora-A K162R (Fig. ?(Fig.5B).5B). Furthermore, ectopic Aurora-A, whether in the kinase-active or -inactive mutant form, did not alter the levels of endogenous RalA (Fig. ?(Fig.5B5B). In the loss-of-function analysis, we first tested whether reducing the level of endogenous Aurora-A affected the localization of endogenous RalA in the human pancreatic cancer cell line HPAC (46), chosen as an example of cells that harbor a mutated KRAS allele (38), exhibit elevated levels of Aurora-A protein (Fig. ?(Fig.3A),3A), and are sensitive to Aurora-A phosphorylation of RalA S194 for transformation (Fig. ?(Fig.3C)3C) and tumorigenicity (Fig. 4B and C). Because constitutive knockdown of endogenous Aurora-A expression leads to rapid G 2/M arrest and subsequently to apoptosis (26), HPAC cells were engineered to express a doxycycline-sensitive TET repressor and Aurora-A shRNA (or the scramble sequence) driven by a TET-ON operator (37), such that Aurora-A protein levels could be inducibly reduced in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. ?(Fig.5C).5C). As expected, in scramble control cells with or without doxycycline in the culture medium, endogenous RalA was detected by immunofluorescence throughout the cytoplasm, at intracellular organelles, and at the plasma membrane along cell-cell borders. On the other hand, cells induced to express Aurora-A shRNA exhibited a noticeable increase in the concentration of RalA protein at the plasma membrane and a concomitant loss at internal membranes (Fig. ?(Fig.5D),5D), which was even more obvious upon biochemical fractionation (Fig. ?(Fig.5E).5E). Thus, by both gain- and loss-of-function analyses, we demonstrate that, akin to PKC promoting translocation of K-Ras4B from the plasma membrane (6), Aurora-A kinase activity promotes dissociation of endogenous RalA from the plasma membrane.  Phosphorylation of S194 by Aurora-A T288D is required for redistribution of RalA.. To address whether S194 of RalA is required for redistribution of RalA in the presence of Aurora-A, we expressed GFP-tagged RalA S194A in which the Aurora-A phosphorylation site was mutated in HEK-TtH cells ectopically expressing either kinase-active Aurora-A T288D or no transgene (vector). Cells expressing kinase-active Aurora-A T288D were smaller, possibly because constitutive activation of Aurora-A may promote more-rapid cell division (Fig. ?(Fig.6A).6A). We found by immunofluorescence analysis that RalA S194A was retained in the plasma membrane, whether Aurora-A was activated or not. In contrast, GFP-RalA S194D, a putative phosphomimetic version of RalA, was observed primarily at internal membranes, consistent with the localization of GFP-RalA in the presence of kinase-active Aurora-A T288D (Fig. ?(Fig.6A).6A). These observations were also supported by biochemical fractionation. In the presence of kinase-active Aurora-A T288D, a higher proportion of the total wild-type RalA was found in the internal membrane fraction than in the S194A mutant, after controlling for different levels of exogenous RalA expression (Fig. ?(Fig.6B).6B). In support of a specific effect of Aurora-A on RalA, expression of kinase-active Aurora-A T288D did not alter the subcellular localization of GFP-RalB (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material), which is highly similar to RalA but lacks the Aurora-A phosphorylation site (66), or of K-Ras4B (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material), in which phosphorylation of a similar C-terminal serine residue by PKC displaces GFP-K-Ras from the plasma membrane (6). Lastly, we demonstrate that the last 20 amino acids of RalA are sufficient for Aurora-A-mediated relocalization of RalA. Specifically, a GFP fusion protein with the most-C-terminal 20 amino acids of RalA, comprising the hypervariable membrane targeting domain and containing the Aurora-A phosphorylation site, was relocalized from the plasma membrane upon expression of kinase-active Aurora-A T288D. Moreover, this relocalization was blocked when S194 was mutated to alanine (Fig. ?(Fig.6C).6C). Thus, relocalization of RalA in the presence of Aurora-A T288D depends upon S194 of RalA.  The RalA effector RalBP1 is translocated from the plasma membrane and activated in the presence of Aurora-A T288D.. To explore the relationship of RalA with its effectors in the context of Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation, we determined whether Aurora-A kinase activity, which alters RalA subcellular localization, also alters that of a key RalA effector, RalBP1/RLIP76 (10, 29, 50). We compared the localization of RalBP1 to that of ectopic RalA in HEK-TtH cells expressing kinase-inactive Aurora-A K162R versus kinase-active Aurora-A T288D. In the presence of kinase-inactive Aurora-A K162R, ectopic RalBP1 colocalized with RalA in the cytoplasm, internal structures, and protrusions of the plasma membrane. In the presence of kinase-active Aurora-A T288D, the plasma membrane pools of both RalA and RalBP1 repartitioned internally (Fig. ?(Fig.7A).7A). These data indicate that Aurora-A coordinately regulates RalA and RalBP1. Expression of the effector domain mutant RalA D49N, which perturbs association of RalBP1 with RalA, did not result in changes in RalBP1 localization in the presence of kinase-inactive Aurora-A K162R versus kinase-active Aurora-A T288D (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material), indicating that Aurora-A-mediated internalization of RalBP1 is dependent on the association between RalA and RalBP1. Furthermore, ectopic Aurora-A expression, either in the kinase-active or in the inactive mutant form, did not alter the levels of endogenous RalBP1 (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). To determine biochemically if this coordinate relocalization enhanced the association of RalBP1 with RalA, vectors encoding RalA (the wild type or the putative phosphomimetic S194D mutant) or RalBP1 were cotransfected into 293T cells, and the amount of RalBP1 coimmunoprecipitating with RalA was assessed by immunoblot analysis. In the absence of serum, when the majority of RalA is in the inactive GDP-bound state, RalBP1 did not readily coimmunoprecipitate with wild-type RalA (Fig. ?(Fig.7B)7B) but did weakly associate with RalA S194D. Addition of serum to activate RalA promoted its association with RalBP1, and this interaction was enhanced nearly fivefold in the case of RalA S194D, compared to the level for wild-type RalA (Fig. ?(Fig.7B).7B). However, Aurora-A activity did not affect all Ral effector interactions equally. Another validated Ral effector, Sec5, neither redistributed in the presence of kinase-active Aurora-A T288D nor preferentially bound RalA S194D (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). Compared to what was found for wild-type RalA, the association between RalA S194D and Sec5 was reduced by about one-third; however, the nature of this difference is unknown (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). Whether the selective influence of Aurora-A on effector association is due to the context of RalA activation, subcellular localization, or indirect effects, such as competition with RalB for the same effector, remains to be determined. Given that compared to RalA, the RalA S194D mutant bound, if anything, more strongly to RalBP1 than to Sec5, we explored a possible relationship between RalBP1 and Aurora-A. Because RalBP1 has been shown to be a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for two Rho family GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42 (10, 29, 50), we investigated the signaling consequences of the observed increased association between RalA and RalBP1. Specifically, we examined the levels of endogenous activated GTP-bound Cdc42 and Rac1 as readouts of RalBP1 GAP activity and assessed whether the expression of kinase-inactive Aurora-A K162R or kinase-active Aurora-A T288D altered RalBP1 GAP activity. To do this, we first activated endogenous RalA in HEK-TtH cells by expression of Rlf-CAAX and measured the amounts of activated GTP-bound Cdc42 and Rac1 in the presence of either kinase-active Aurora-A T288D or kinase-inactive Aurora-A K162R. In cells expressing kinase-active Aurora-A T288D, activation of RalA signaling by Rlf-CAAX reduced the level of GTP-bound Cdc42 by one-half to one-third compared to the level for vector control cells (Fig. ?(Fig.7C).7C). The nature of the selectivity toward decreased Cdc42-GTP levels compared to Rac1-GTP levels is unknown but, we speculate, could be due to differences in subcellular localization. As RalBP1 GAP activity is not altered upon binding activated RalA in vitro (50), recruitment of RalBP1 to specific subcellular sites may instead underlie the reduction in GTP-bound Cdc42. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of RalBP1, as confirmed by immunoblot analysis, increased the levels of both activated GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 both in the presence and in the absence of Aurora-A T288D (Fig. ?(Fig.7D;7D; see also Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). Such a result is not surprising if indeed RalBP1 acts as a GAP for Cdc42 and Rac1. These results are consistent with a model in which Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation of RalA leads to an enhanced interaction with RalBP1, perhaps to alter its subcellular localization, resulting in a decrease in GTP-bound Cdc42. We next explored the cellular consequences of the increased association between RalA and RalBP1 and the decrease in GTP-bound Cdc42 promoted by Aurora-A T288D. Cdc42 activation causes formation of actin microspikes and filopodia, whereas Rac activation promotes concentration of actin at the leading edge of moving cells and the formation of lamellipodia. Therefore, we assayed for changes in cellular morphology in HEK-TtH cells transiently expressing GFP-RalA in the presence of either empty vector or kinase-active Aurora-A T288D. We first confirmed that stable expression of kinase-inactive Aurora-A K162R or kinase-active Aurora-A T288D did not alter actin cytoskeleton organization in the absence of exogenous RalA (see Fig. S8 in the supplemental material). Consistent with the biochemical decreases in Cdc42- and Rac1-GTP levels in the presence of kinase-active Aurora-A T288D (Fig. ?(Fig.7C),7C), \u00a1\u00ad76% of HEK-TtH cells expressing GFP-RalA and empty vector displayed filopodia and lamellipodia, whereas \u00a1\u00ad30% of cells expressing both GFP-RalA and kinase-active Aurora-A T288D displayed filopodia and lamellipodia, indicative of decreases in both Cdc42 and Rac1 activations (Fig. ?(Fig.7E).7E). In agreement, HEK-TtH cells transiently expressing a phosphomimetic mutant of RalA, GFP-RalA S194D, displayed an absence of filopodia and lamellipodia (Fig. ?(Fig.7E).7E). Taken together, these data support the notion that Aurora-A T288D expression increases the association between RalA and its effector RalBP1, leading to enhanced RalBP1 function, as measured by decreased Cdc42- and Rac1-GTP levels and decreased Rho family GTPase-driven morphology. These studies demonstrate that Aurora-A has a biological impact on RalA activation of RalBP1, but it remains to be determined whether such activation of RalBP1, or even suppression of Cdc42, fosters transformation. On one hand, RalBP1 contributes positively to transformation. Specifically, knockdown of RalBP1 in HEK-TtH cells transformed by Rlf-CAAX in the absence or presence of Aurora-A T288D, as confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. ?(Fig.7F),7F), exhibited reduced anchorage-independent growth, compared to the level for the scramble control counterparts (Fig. ?(Fig.7G).7G). The basis of this decreased transformation is unknown, but given that RalBP1 knockdown cells can be cultured extensively with no overt impact on passaging (not shown) and that mice homozygous for a gene trap mutation of RALBP1 (RIP1 and RLIP76) are viable (3), the decrease in anchorage-independent growth may be related to a function RalBP1 plays in transformation, although this remains to be formally tested. Similarly, preventing RalA association with RalBP1 by introduction of the D49N effector domain mutation within a constitutively active RalA Q72L background slightly reduced transformation (33). On the other hand, RalA also contributes to transformation by pathways aside from RalBP1. Specifically, knockdown of RalBP1 (Fig. ?(Fig.7G)7G) did not reduce transformation to the same extent as knockdown of RalA (Fig. ?(Fig.2C).2C). Similarly, a D49E mutation, which inhibits binding of Sec5 and Exo84, reduced the transforming activity of RalA Q72L to a greater extent than the D49N mutation (33). Since RalBP1 could potentially serve as a GAP for other untested Rho GTPases (29) and has additional activities (2, 30, 67), it also remains to be tested if Cdc42 is the relevant target for RalBP1 in transformation. Moreover, activation of Cdc42 has been reported to both promote and suppress transformation. While RNA interference (RNAi) suppression of a Cdc42GEF or dominant-negative Cdc42 enhanced soft agar growth of human colon carcinoma cells (44), activation of Cdc42 promoted transformation of rodent fibroblasts (51). Thus, while activation of RalBP1 and suppression of Cdc42 constitute one plausible mechanism for promoting transformation, others are certainly possible.  Differential effects of Aurora-A versus Aurora-A T288D on RalA functions.. Aurora-A is upregulated, rather than mutationally activated, in human cancers (22, 31); hence, we also explored the effect on RalA function in cells expressing wild-type versus constitutively active Aurora-A. It has been demonstrated that expression of either version of Aurora-A resulted in elevated levels of GTP-bound and thus active RalA and that mutation of S194, but not S183, reduced this effect (66). Similarly, knockdown of the PP2A phosphatase subunit a\u00a5\u00e2 has been found to lead to elevated levels of both RalA S183 and S194 phosphorylation and GTP-bound RalA (56). These data support the notion that phosphorylation of S194 activates wild-type RalA. We thus measured the level of RalA-GTP in human cells expressing Aurora-A versus Aurora-A T288D. Specifically, human 293 cells were transiently transfected with a vector carrying no transgene (as a negative control), encoding t-Ag (as a positive control, since t-Ag blocks the ability of PP2A to dephosphorylate S183 and S194 of RalA, resulting in elevated phosphorylation at these sites [56]), encoding Aurora-A T288D, or encoding wild-type Aurora-A. Expression of these transgenes and of endogenous RalA was confirmed by immunoblot analysis, and the levels of activated GTP-bound endogenous RalA were assessed by pulldown analyses (Fig. ?(Fig.8A).8A). As previously reported (56), t-Ag promoted robust activation of RalA, compared to the level for vector control cells. Similarly, wild-type Aurora-A was highly effective in activating RalA. Unexpectedly, expression of Aurora-A T288D did not cause a significant increase in RalA-GTP, compared to the level for vector control cells (Fig. ?(Fig.8B).8B). Since Aurora-A T288D potentiates Ral transforming activity (Fig. ?(Fig.2C;2C; see also Fig. 9B, C, and D) yet does not robustly activate RalA (Fig. ?(Fig.8B),8B), Aurora-A may foster Ral-mediated transformation by additional mechanisms independent of RalA-GTP formation. Given this result, we tested whether phosphorylation and subcellular localization of RalA were differentially affected by Aurora-A versus Aurora-A T288D. 293 cells were therefore stably infected with retroviruses carrying no transgene, encoding Aurora-A, or encoding Aurora-A T288D. RalA phosphorylation levels were measured by immunoprecipitation of endogenous RalA, followed by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific serine antibody, and endogenous RalA-GTP and total RalA levels were determined by pulldowns and immunoblot analyses total cellular lysates versus lysates derived from fractionated internal membranes. As expected (66), RalA serine phosphorylation was elevated upon expression of Aurora-A, and this was further increased in cells expressing constitutively active Aurora-A T288D. In contrast to their differential effects on RalA phosphorylation and GTP loading, both versions of this kinase resulted in higher levels of total RalA in the internal membrane fraction, although a greater proportion of the internal pool was phosphorylated in cells expressing Aurora-A T288D (Fig. ?(Fig.8B).8B). This result was independently validated by immunofluorescence; GFP-RalA accumulation at internal membranes increased in cells expressing either version of Aurora-A (Fig. ?(Fig.8C),8C), and in both cases, mutating S194A in RalA reduced this translocation (Fig. ?(Fig.8D).8D). The reason for the increase in RalA phosphorylation with no corresponding increase in GTP loading in the presence of Aurora-A T288D is unclear. One possibility is that perhaps increased phosphorylation of RalA by Aurora-A T288D promotes translocation of phosphorylated RalA away from the plasma membrane, where RalGEF proteins associate with activated Ras to then reduce RalGEF-mediated RalA activation. In support of this model, RalA S194D, a putative phosphomimetic version of RalA, was enriched at internal membranes, compared to the level for wild-type RalA (Fig. ?(Fig.6A),6A), but was less active (lower GTP levels), when coexpressed with an activated, plasma membrane-targeted RalGEF protein, than the wild-type or even the S194A mutant of RalA (Fig. ?(Fig.8E).8E). Nevertheless, it still remains to be resolved why robust phosphorylation of RalA by Aurora-A T288D does not coincide with elevated RalA-GTP levels.  Wild-type versus activated-Aurora-A-mediated transformation.. Wild-type Aurora-A and Aurora-A T288D both increased RalA phosphorylation and promoted RalA translocation, whereas wild-type but not constitutively active Aurora-A T288D potently increased RalA-GTP levels. Capitalizing on the ability of these two forms of Aurora-A to differentially alter RalA functions, we tested whether elevated RalA-GTP or endomembrane translocation was associated with Aurora-A-mediated transformation in cells with activated Ral signaling. HEK-TtH cells in which the Ras-RalGEF pathway was activated at different levels by expression of oncogenic Ras (Ras G12V), an oncogenic Ras mutant that preferentially activates RalGEF proteins (Ras G12V,E37G) or an activated RalGEF protein (Rlf-CAAX), were stably infected with retroviruses either carrying no transgene or encoding kinase-inactive Aurora-A K162R (as a negative control), Aurora-A, or Aurora-A T288D. Expression was assessed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. ?(Fig.9A),9A), and cells were assayed for anchorage-independent growth. As noted previously (Fig. ?(Fig.1),1), Aurora-A T288D, but not negative-control kinase-inactive Aurora-A K126R, cooperated to various degrees with all three activators of Ral to promote transformation. Wild-type Aurora-A enhanced this transformation only marginally better than Aurora-A T288D in Ras G12V and Ras G12V,E37G backgrounds (\u00a1\u00ad1.1-fold) (Fig. 9B and C) but approximately twofold in the Rlf-CAAX background (Fig. ?(Fig.9D).9D). Given that only Aurora-A robustly activates RalA-GTP, whereas both Aurora-A and Aurora-A T288D promote translocation of RalA and growth transformation, their ability to enhance transformation was attributed more to endomembrane translocation than to formation of RalA-GTP in these experiments. Conversely, however, the ability of constitutively activated RalA (RalA Q72L) to promote anchorage-independent growth of HEK-TtH cells was not altered upon introduction of either the S194A mutation or the S194D mutation (see Fig. S9 in the supplemental material). Thus, in the context of constitutively active RalA, the loss of S194 phosphorylation has no effect on RalA transforming activity.  Summary.. Aurora-A normally functions as a mitotic kinase to ensure proper chromosome separation and cytokinesis (42). This kinase is frequently overexpressed in various human cancers and can become mislocalized to the cytoplasm, where it may phosphorylate inappropriate substrates, leading to both genomic instability and altered signaling, promoting cancerous development (22, 31, 32). We find that activated Aurora-A cooperates with the RalGEF-Ral effector signaling arm of oncogenic Ras to promote transformation in human model cells (Fig. ?(Fig.11 and ?and2)2) and, further, that transformation (Fig. ?(Fig.3)3) and in some cases also tumor growth (Fig. ?(Fig.4)4) of pancreatic cancer cells characterized by oncogenic Ras mutations depend upon S194 of RalA, the site phosphorylated by Aurora-A (66). In contrast to RalA, the nearly identical RalB protein cannot support anchorage-independent growth transformation or tumorigenicity of human cells (36, 38) and is neither phosphorylated (66) nor required for Aurora-A to promote RalGEF transformation of HEK-TtH cells (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Thus, in addition to its effect on chromosome stability, aberrant overexpression or cell cycle-independent expression of Aurora-A in cancer may also foster transformation and tumorigenesis through phosphorylation of RalA, a key substrate of the oncogenic Ras-RalGEF effector pathway (66). Indeed, the finding (9) of Aurora-A overexpression in a cell cycle-independent fashion and its localization throughout tumor cells, as opposed to its restriction to the nuclei of normal cells, suggests a nonmitotic role for this kinase when it is aberrantly expressed. Overexpression of Aurora-A is not, however, the only mode of fostering the tumorigenic activity of RalA through phosphorylation. Phosphatase PP2A A\u00a5\u00e2 also affects both the phosphorylation status and the tumorigenicity of RalA in HEK cells (56). Thus, RalA activation through RalGEF stimulation by oncogenic Ras in cooperation with phosphorylation by kinase activation or phosphatase inactivation promotes tumorigenesis. We also report that phosphorylation of RalA by Aurora-A leads to internalization of RalA and to elevated RalBP1 GAP activity (Fig. ?(Fig.5,5, ?,6,6, and ?and7).7). The significance of differential subcellular localization and effector utilization upon Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation of RalA remains to be determined. We speculate that Aurora-A phosphorylation of RalA at S194 promotes internalization of RalA, and increases in the association of RalA with RalBP1 may spatially restrict the activation of Cdc42 and Rac1, thereby leading to changes in actin dynamics. It is not clear if these changes underlie the above-mentioned requirement for RalA phosphorylation in transformation and tumorigenesis. Increased RalA translocation upon expression of kinase-active Aurora-A T288D is transforming and depends upon S194 phosphorylation, even in the absence of robust additional activation of RalA-GTP. In contrast, mutating the S194 Aurora-A phosphorylation site did not alter the ability of constitutively activated RalA to transform cells (see Fig. S9 in the supplemental material). Whether this reflects pleiotropic effects of Aurora-A T288D or the ability of an oncogenic activated mutation in RalA to overcome the need for phosphorylation for transformation is unclear. Thus, while certainly the increased GTP loading of RalA in the presence of activated Aurora-A promotes transformation, it is unclear if the same holds true for internalization of RalA and, if so, whether this reflects suppression of Cdc42 activity or another effect. Although our studies relate only to the situation in cancer cells, it is possible that regulation of RalA by Aurora-A in normal cells may also play a role in normal entry and exit from mitosis, as Aurora-A is required for chromosome separation and cytokinesis (1, 18, 41, 43, 68), RalA is also required for proper cytokinesis (11-13), and the RalBP1 homolog cytocentrin is involved in proper centrosome duplication and segregation (52). In normal cells, Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation of RalA may promote the activation of the RalA-RalBP1 complex in a spatially restricted manner to promote the switching off of endocytosis during mitosis to ensure proper mitotic entry (13, 55). Even so, as both kinase-active and -inactive versions of Aurora-A can impair mitosis (43), yet only the kinase-active mutant transforms rodent cell lines (5) and, as we demonstrate here, human cells in cooperation with oncogenic Ras, the effect of Aurora-A on cell transformation may not be solely through chromosome instability. Phosphorylation of RalA either by a decrease in phosphatase PP2A a\u00a5\u00e2 expression (56) or by ectopic expression of Aurora-A (66) has been found to increase the level of RalA-GTP. In summary, first, we and others (56, 66) report that the concurrent activations of two seemingly disparate proteins, Ras and Aurora-A, converge through a common protein, RalA, to promote tumorigenesis. Aurora kinase inhibitors are currently under clinical evaluation for cancer treatment (32, 39). Thus, RalA may be a potential target for some of the antitumor activity of these inhibitors. In turn, RAS mutations may be a genetic determinant for patient response to these inhibitors and establish RalA phosphorylation at S194 as an important biomarker for their antitumor efficacy. Second, we found that Aurora-A promotes both internalization of RalA in an S194-dependent fashion and activation of RalBP1, as measured by reduced Cdc42-GTP levels. Whether this internalization of RalA plays a role in transformation or instead reflects another function of the protein remains to be determined. Supplementary Material. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Radiosensitization of EGFR/HER2 positive pancreatic cancer is mediated by inhibition of Akt independent of Ras mutational status\tPurpose. Epidermal growth factor receptor family members (e.g., EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4) are commonly overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. We investigated the effects of inhibition of EGFR/HER2 signaling on pancreatic cancer to elucidate the role(s) of EGFR/HER2 in radiosensitization and to provide evidence in support of further clinical investigations. Experimental Design. Expression of EGFR family members in pancreatic cancer lines was assessed by qRT-PCR. Cell growth inhibition was determined by MTS assay. The effects of inhibition of EGFR family receptors and downstream signaling pathways on in vitro radiosensitivity were evaluated using clonogenic assays. Growth delay was used to evaluate the effects of nelfinavir on in vivo tumor radiosensitivity. Results. Lapatinib inhibited cell growth in four pancreatic cancer cell lines, but radiosensitized only wild-type K-ras-expressing T3M4 cells. Akt activation was blocked in a wild-type K-ras cell line, whereas constitutive phosphorylation of Akt and ERK was seen in lines expressing mutant K-ras. Overexpression of constitutively-active K-ras(G12V) abrogated lapatinib-mediated inhibition of both Akt phosphorylation and radiosensitization. Inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling with U0126 had no effect on radiosensitization, whereas inhibition of activated Akt with LY294002 (enhancement ratio 1.2?1.8) or nelfinavir (enhancement ratio 1.2?1.4) radiosensitized cells regardless of K-ras mutation status. Oral nelfinavir administration to mice bearing mutant K-ras-containing Capan-2 xenografts resulted in a greater than additive increase in radiation-mediated tumor growth delay (synergy assessment ratio of 1.5). Conclusions. Inhibition of EGFR/HER2 enhances radiosensitivity in wild-type K-ras pancreatic cancer. Nelfinavir, and other PI3K/Akt inhibitors, are effective pancreatic radiosensitizers regardless of K-ras mutation status. Translational Relevance. In this article we provide two important pieces of evidence to guide future cancer care. First, constitutive activation of K-ras results in resistance to radiosensitization by inhibition of EGFR and HER2. This result suggests that use of EGFR/HER2 inhibitors as radiosensitizers of pancreatic cancer may not be efficacious given the high K-ras mutation prevalence in pancreatic cancer. Second, we provide the first evidence documenting the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of nelfinavir as a radiosensitizer of pancreatic cancer and further evidence supporting its role as a radiosensitizer. These results provide a rationale for future clinical investigation of the tolerability and therapeutic efficacy of nelfinavir in combination with radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer. INTRODUCTION. Pancreatic cancer, with nearly 33,000 cases diagnosed annually, is the 4 th leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States (1). Improvements in understanding the molecular aberrations underlying pancreatic cancer (reviewed in (2)), have led to the approval of drugs targeting these abnormalities (3). Some of these agents target the members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (EGFR/ErbB-1/HER1, ErbB-2/HER2/neu, ErbB-3/HER3, and ErbB-4/HER4). Ligand activation of EGFR-family proteins (EGFR is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily of transmembrane proteins) results in perturbation of a variety of downstream signaling cascades. The clinical efficacy of drugs targeting the EGFR family of proteins was hypothesized due to the observed overexpression of EGFR in 40-70% of pancreatic cancers (4, 5), along with overexpression of HER2 in a smaller subset of cases (6-8). The use of EGFR family inhibitors has been supported by data demonstrating that blockade of EGFR or HER2 inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro (9-11). Downregulation of both EGFR and HER2 has been suggested to be more effective at inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell proliferation than inhibition of either receptor alone (12). EGFR-family inhibitors have recently been demonstrated to radiosensitize multiple cancers (reviewed in (13)). We have previously demonstrated that lapatinib ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GW572016\",\"term_id\":\"289151303\",\"term_text\":\"GW572016\"}}GW572016, Tykerb\u00a2\u00e7, GlaxoSmithKline), a dual EGFR and HER2 small molecule inhibitor, is an effective radiosensitizer for breast cancer, a cancer that frequently expresses high levels of HER2 and/or EGFR (14). Interestingly, the signaling pathway(s) downstream of EGFR/HER2 responsible for radiosensitization appears to vary by cancer subtype. While numerous compounds have been used successfully in laboratory studies to directly inhibit signaling pathways located downstream of EGFR and/or HER2, translation to efficacious and tolerable clinical use has been difficult. Nelfinavir (Viracept\u00a2\u00e7, Pfizer), a Type 1 HIV protease inhibitor, may downregulate Akt signaling with minimal side effects. HIV protease inhibitors were first noted to inhibit the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma independent of their anti-retroviral effect soon after receiving FDA approval in 1997 (15, 16). Several groups then showed that these compounds radiosensitize several tumor cells via blockade of Akt signaling (17) and/or proteasome inhibition (18). The exact mechanism of this effect remains unclear, as nelfinavir has been demonstrated to increase caspase-dependent apoptosis, non-apoptotic (caspase-independent) death, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagy (19, 20). We initiated this study to determine whether inhibition of EGFR/HER2 signaling could sensitize pancreatic cancer to ionizing radiation to provide data in support of a clinical trial. We expanded the study to determine the downstream signaling pathways involved in radiosensitization and to demonstrate that nelfinavir, and other agents that inhibit the PI3K\u00a1\u00e6Akt pathway, is an effective radiosensitizer in the majority of pancreatic cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Inhibitors and growth factors. Lapatinib (Tykerb\u00a2\u00e7) was provided by GlaxoSmithKline (Middlesex, United Kingdom). LY294002 was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) and U0126 from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Inhibitors were reconstituted in DMSO and working solutions subdivided and stored at ?20 \u00a1\u00c6C. Tablets of nelfinavir mesylate (650 mg) were purchased from the UNC inpatient pharmacy and ground into fine powder before being dissolved into 100% ethanol prior to each use. EGF ligand was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Control cells were treated with equal concentrations of DMSO or ethanol. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Gene-specific 5\u00a1\u00af-3\u00a1\u00af oligonucleotides and intervening fluorescent dye-labeled probes for human genes encoding EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4 (Supplemental Table 1) were designed, synthesized, labeled, and purified using standard techniques. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with an ABI PRISM 7900 instrument from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). mRNA sequences for each gene were transcribed in vitro using MEGAscript (Ambion, Austin, TX), and used as positive controls and absolute quantitation standards for the assays. Amplification of two-fold serial dilutions of RNA was used to construct standard linear curves that permitted accurate measurements of 200 to 90 million template copies. Total RNA was isolated from each cell line in triplicate by using a QIAGEN (Valencia, CA) RNeasy kit and was treated with RNase-free DNase. Total RNA (10 ng) isolated from each cell line was assayed. Cell lines and culture conditions. Pancreatic cancer cell lines (T3M4, Capan-2, MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). No additional authentication was performed although the ATCC performs DNA profiling of cell lines and all cell lines were cultured for less than 6 months prior to being reconstituted from frozen stocks. Cells were maintained as monolayer cultures at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2. Cell proliferation assay and IC 50 determination. Cells (1.5-5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 3 cells/well) were plated on 96 well plates in 100 \u00a5\u00ecl media with increasing concentrations of lapatinib (0.01 \u00a5\u00ecM to 50.0 \u00a5\u00ecM) or nelfinavir (0.001 \u00a5\u00ecM to 20.0 \u00a5\u00ecM). After 72 h, cell viability was measured via MTS assay according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega, Madison, WI). IC 50 values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated according to a non-linear curve fit and compared by the extra sum-of-squares F test using GraphPad Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. Cells were initially starved overnight followed by 1 h lapatinib (1 or 5 \u00a5\u00ecM) pretreatment and then EGF (10 ng/ml) stimulation for 15 min. Cellular extracts were prepared by washing cells with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysing them in cold NLB buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.3], 50 mM sodium fluoride, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM sodium vanadate, aprotinin [6 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml], and leupeptin [10 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml]). Receptor proteins were precipitated from cell lysates (1 mg) with a commercial antibody against HER2 (clone 9G6.10; Neomarkers, Inc./Thermo Scientific, Fremont, CA) or with a non-commercial antibody against HER1/EGFR (V22) kindly provided by S. Earp (Univ. of North Carolina) (14) at 4\u00a1\u00c6C overnight. Immunocomplexes were then pulled down with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 3 h at 4\u00a1\u00c6C, washed three times with NLB, and analyzed by western blot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20-HRP; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). Western blot analyses were performed to determine the effect of pharmacological inhibitors on MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt activation. Cells were plated at 40% confluence in 60 mm dishes and the following day treated with inhibitors against EGFR/HER2 (lapatinib, 1-5 \u00a5\u00ecM), PI3K (LY294002, 5-20 \u00a5\u00ecM), MEK1/2 (U0126, 1-5 \u00a5\u00ecM), or vehicle alone (DMSO) for one hour or with nelfinavir (1 \u00a5\u00ecM) or vehicle alone (ethanol) for 4 or 28 h prior to lysis. Thirty \u00a5\u00ecg of protein lysates (harvested as described above) were separated over 15% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and immunoblots performed utilizing phospho-ERK1/2- (#9106), ERK1/2- (#9122), phospho-Akt(Ser473)- (#9271), or Akt-(#9272), specific antibodies (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Cambridge, MA). Anti \u00a5\u00e1-tubulin (TU-02) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Clonogenic survival assays. Cells were trypsinized to create single cell suspensions, seeded into T-25 flasks at defined densities, and incubated overnight to ensure log phase of growth. The next day, two hours pre-irradiation, cells were fed with fresh media supplemented with either lapatinib (5 \u00a5\u00ecM), U0126 (5 \u00a5\u00ecM), or LY294002 (10 \u00a5\u00ecM). Cells treated with nelfinavir (1 or 5 \u00a5\u00ecM) received 2 or 26 h of pre-treatment prior to irradiation. Control cells were maintained in media containing a corresponding concentration of vehicle (DMSO or ethanol) alone. Cells were irradiated with single doses of 1, 3, 5, or 7 Gy using a Mark I 137Cs irradiator (JL Shepherd, San Fernando, CA) delivering a dose rate of 158 cGy/min. Two hours post-irradiation, all drugs were removed and the cells re-fed with fresh media. After 10 to 15 days, surviving colonies were fixed with a solution of methanol and acetic acid (3:1 v/v) and stained with 1% crystal violet. Colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted and survival curves were generated. The surviving fraction was calculated from the number of colonies formed in the irradiated dishes compared with the number formed in the unirradiated control, where plating efficiency is defined as the percentage of cells plated that form colonies in unirradiated dishes, and surviving fraction = number of colonies formed/(number of cells plated \u00a1\u00bf plating efficiency). Statistical comparisons were done using GraphPad Prism according to the two-tailed nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The clonogenic survival curve for each condition was fitted to a linear-quadratic model (Y=e ?[A * X + B * X 2]) using GraphPad Prism according to a least squares fit, weighted to minimize the relative distances squared, and compared using the extra sum-of-squares F test. Each point represents the mean surviving fraction calculated from three independent experiments done in triplicate for each treatment condition; error bars represent the standard deviation. The mean inactivation dose was calculated according to the method of Fertil (21) and the cell survival enhancement ratio (ER) was calculated as the ratio of the mean inactivation dose under control conditions divided by the mean inactivation dose after drug exposure as described by Morgan (22). A value significantly greater than 1 indicates radiosensitization. For the drug dose response comparison, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni posttests was performed using GraphPad Prism. Ectopic expression of mutant K-ras. T3M4 cells, which are wild-type for K-ras, were transfected with pCGN-K-ras(G12V)-HA or an empty vector control as previously described (23) using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Clonogenic survival assays were performed 24 hours after transfection and protein lysates prepared as described above for western blot analysis with anti-K-ras serum (#OP24; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Xenografts. Four to five week-old athymic BALB/c female nude mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA), housed in filter-topped cages in an aseptic environment, and maintained per defined protocol approved by and in accordance with the University of North Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To determine the biologically optimal dose of nelfinavir with regards to inhibition of Akt activation, mice (n=1 per group) were injected subcutaneously in the flanks with Capan-2 cells (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6) resuspended in 200 \u00a5\u00ecl of a 1:1 ratio of PBS:Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and treated with nelfinavir (50, 100, or 150 mg/kg once daily) or vehicle alone by oral gavage for a total of five days. Mice were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation and tumors harvested using sterile technique 4 hours after the last dose on day 5. Excised tumors were flash frozen and pulverized with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen prior to transfer into 1-2 ml of RIPA buffer [150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Indianopolis, IN)]. Lysates were then homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann, Westbury, NY), incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4\u00a1\u00c6C for 15 minutes; supernatants were stored at ?80\u00a1\u00c6C prior to immunoblotting for P-Akt, Akt, and \u00a5\u00e1-tubulin as described above. To assess the tumor growth delay induced by nelfinavir, mice (n=6 per group) bearing Capan-2 xenografts prepared as described above were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: 1) vehicle alone, 2) nelfinavir alone (150 mg/kg daily by oral gavage) \u00a1\u00bf 10 days, 3) radiation alone (200 cGy/day on days 6, 7, and 8), or 4) radiation plus nelfinavir (as above). Radiation was delivered by a linear accelerator (Primus, Siemens, New York, NY) to anaesthetized mice using 6 MeV electrons and a custom lead cutout. Tumors were measured at 2-3 day intervals using Vernier calipers and the tumor volumes calculated (V = \u00a5\u00f0 \u00a1\u00bf length \u00a1\u00bf width 2 / 6). Tumor volumes were fit using a straight line non-linear regression (GraphPad Prism) and compared using the extra sum-of-squares F test. To assess antagonistic, additive, or synergistic effects, we used the fractional product method at day 25 (24, 25). The observed fractional tumor volume (FTV) is equal to the mean tumor volume of each treated group (nelfinavir, radiation, or nelfinavir + radiation) divided by the mean tumor volume of the control group. The expected FTV from the combined treatment (FTV nelfinavir + radiation) is calculated by multiplying the observed FTV nelfinavir by the observed FTV radiation. Dividing the expected FTV nelfinavir + radiation by the observed FTV nelfinavir + radiation yields a synergy assessment ratio in which a value >1 suggests that the combined treatments are effectively synergistic, <1 antagonistic, and =1 additive. RESULTS. Lapatinib blocks EGFR and HER2 activation. We have shown previously that both lapatinib and erlotinib, an EGFR-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, block the soft-agar growth of several pancreatic cancer cell lines 1. Since EGFR inhibition has been demonstrated to radiosensitize other cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and breast cancer (13), we sought to determine whether these compounds could also radiosensitize pancreatic cancer cells and whether this radiosensitization correlated with EGFR and HER2 expression. We first evaluated by qRT-PCR the relative expression levels of all four members of the EGFR family of receptors among a panel of four pancreatic cancer cell lines (Table 1). While HER2 levels were similar among all four lines, EGFR levels were 10-17-fold higher in the PANC-1 and T3M4 cells relative to that observed in the Capan-2 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Expression of HER3, a family member that lacks kinase activity, was approximately 10-fold higher in the Capan-2 and T3M4 cells. HER4, the final family member, had very low mRNA expression levels across all four cell lines. All cell lines showed an anti-proliferative effect in response to increasing concentrations of both erlotinib and lapatinib (Table 1). The dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib demonstrated improved growth inhibitory activity compared to erlotinib in Capan-2 and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines (p = 0.0008 and 0.0001, respectively), a finding consistent with low levels of EGFR mRNA in these cell lines. PANC-1 and T3M4 cells had higher levels of EGFR than HER2 expression, and demonstrated similar growth inhibition by lapatinib and erlotinib (p=ns). To demonstrate that lapatinib blocks ligand-stimulated EGFR and HER2 activation in our pancreatic cells activation of receptors was analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by western blot analysis. Consistent with what we and others have previously reported using in vitro, in vivo, and patient samples ((14, 26)and reviewed in (27)), lapatinib blocked activation of both EGFR and HER2 in all four pancreatic cell lines (Fig. 1A). Pancreatic cancer cell lines harboring K-ras mutations are resistant to lapatinib-mediated radiosensitization. Due to the improved anti-proliferative and ligand-stimulated receptor inhibition of lapatinib in the tested cell lines, we chose to investigate whether lapatinib could radiosensitize pancreatic cancer cells. Clonogenic survival assays were performed on our panel of cells that were either treated with lapatinib (5 \u00a5\u00ecM) or vehicle alone for the 2 hours preceding and 2 hours after irradiation. We chose this short duration of drug treatment because the clonogenic survival and cell cycle distribution of non-irradiated cell lines that were pretreated in this fashion with either lapatinib or DMSO control were not statistically different (data not shown), suggesting that the 4 hour exposure to lapatinib did not radiosensitize cells simply by inhibiting proliferation or by redistributing cells to a more radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle. T3M4 cells were radiosensitized by lapatinib while MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, and Capan-2 cells were not radiosensitized (Fig. 1B). Lapatinib-mediated radiosensitization occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Supplemental Fig. 1) and at doses unlikely to have significant off-target effects (28). The ER of 1.3 for T3M4 cells is consistent with that reported for known radiosensitizers such as gemcitabine or cisplatin (29, 30). Suggestive of the importance of K-ras mutations in the radiation response, T3M4 cells express wild-type K-ras while MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1 and Capan-2 cell lines all express mutant K-ras (31). The presence of constitutively active, mutant forms of K-ras, a molecular abnormality seen in approximately 90% of pancreatic cancers (32, 33), has previously been demonstrated to confer radioresistance (34-37). Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of EGFR/HER2 signaling by lapatinib with resulting radiosensitization was conferred through inhibition of specific downstream signaling pathways that are directly activated in the presence of constitutively active Ras. We first evaluated the ability of lapatinib to inhibit downstream signaling of the PI3K/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways, two pathways capable of being activated by both EGFR/HER2 and Ras. Activation of Akt, but not ERK1/2, was completely inhibited by lapatinib in the T3M4 cells, while neither ERK1/2 nor Akt were inhibited by lapatinib in cells with mutant K-ras (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these data suggest that resistance to lapatinib radiosensensitization in the MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, and Capan-2 cells may be mediated by activation of PI3K/Akt by mutant Ras. K-ras expression blocks radiosensitization by lapatinib. To determine the role of mutant Ras in conferring radioresistance in these cells, we next evaluated whether ectopic expression of mutant K-ras could abrogate lapatinib-mediated radiosensitization of T3M4 cells. Cells treated with lapatinib that were expressing K-ras(G12V), but not vector control, exhibited sustained Akt activation and no change in ERK activation (Fig. 2A). This correlated with a lack of radiosensitization by lapatinib in cells expressing K-ras(G12V), but not vector control (Fig. 2B). These results support a model in which the presence of mutant K-ras can render pancreatic cancer cells resistant to lapatinib-mediated radiosensitization. Pancreatic cancer cells are radiosensitized by inhibition of PI3K/Akt, but not MEK/ERK. If activated Ras could block the radiosensitization observed with lapatinib-mediated inhibition of EGFR/HER2 in the T3M4 cells, we reasoned that radiosensitization by lapatinib was being mediated by the inhibition of a downstream signaling pathway(s) that is activated by both EGFR/HER2 and Ras. In addition, we hypothesized that in the mutant K-ras cell lines (MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, and Capan-2) activation of these downstream pathways by Ras could be responsible for their observed resistance to lapatinib-mediated radiosensitization. Downstream signaling from EGFR/HER2 and Ras are both known to activate several key pathways in common, including the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways (13, 38). To determine whether inhibition of Raf/MEK/ERK and/or PI3K/Akt could radiosensitize pancreatic cancer cells, we evaluated the ability of U0126, a MEK inhibitor and known breast cancer radiosensitizer (14), and LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor (39), to sensitize our panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines to radiation-induced cell death. Despite effective inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in all cell lines by U0126 (Supplemental Fig. 2A), this inhibition of MEK/ERK activation did not radiosensitize any of the pancreatic cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig. 2B). A modest increase in Akt activation was seen in some cell lines in response to U0126 treatment, a result consistent with feedback-signaling loops described by others (40, 41) and consistent with the role of Akt in the radiation response. In contrast, treatment with LY294002 resulted in effective inhibition of Akt with consequent radiosensitization (ERs ranged from 1.3 to 2.1) of all cells regardless of their K-ras mutational status (Figs. 3A, B). Nelfinavir blocks Akt phosphorylation and radiosensitizes both wild-type and mutant K-ras cell lines. Several FDA approved HIV protease inhibitors including nelfinavir and ritonivir have been shown to block Akt signaling and radiosensitize HNSCC, breast, lung, and brain tumor cell lines (19, 42-46). Since currently available PI3K inhibitors have demonstrated unacceptable clinical toxicity, we sought to evaluate whether inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway with nelfinavir would radiosensitize pancreatic cancer cells. Cells treated with a clinically attainable dose of nelfinavir (47) or vehicle alone showed decreased Akt activation after 28 hours, but not after a four hour exposure (Fig. 4A). Little change in ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 4A) or cell cycle distribution (data not shown) was seen at either time point. To determine the effect of nelfinavir on radiation response, cells were similarly pretreated with nelfinavir for either 2 or 26 hours prior to and 2 hours after irradiation and their ability to proliferate in clonogenic survival assays determined. Both mutant and wild-type K-ras cells were radiosensitized (ERs ranged from 1.3 to 1.5, Fig. 4B) after 26 hours of nelfinavir pre-treatment. Consistent with effects on Akt activation, no radiosensitization was seen after 2 hour pre-treatment. To exclude the possibility that nelfinavir treatment induces growth arrest, MTS assay was used to monitor proliferation after exposure to nelfinavir for either 2 or 26 hours. No significant difference in proliferation was seen with either length of exposure in any of the four cell lines tested (data not shown). Nelfinavir inhibits Akt activation and results in tumor growth delay of Capan-2-bearing xenografts. We next assessed the ability of nelfinavir to radiosensitize a mouse xenograft model utilizing Capan-2 cells, chosen based on their robust ability to form tumors. First, to determine the optimal dose of nelfinavir required to inhibit Akt activation in vivo, Capan-2 cells (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6) were injected into the flanks of athymic BALB/c nude mice. After palpable tumors developed, mice were treated with indicated doses of nelfinavir or vehicle control by gastric gavage for 5 consecutive days. On the 5 th day, mice were sacrificed, tumor lysates prepared, and Akt activation assessed by western blot analysis. At a dose of 150 mg/kg, phospho-Akt levels in vivo were significantly decreased (Fig. 5A). With this optimized dose, tumor growth in cohorts (n=6 mice per treatment group) were compared with mice either sham-treated or treated with nelfinavir, radiation, or nelfinavir plus radiation. A clinically relevant dose of radiation (2 Gy per fraction) was chosen to provide meaningful assessment of any radiosensitization. Tumor growth following treatment was significantly slower in mice treated with nelfinavir and radiation than with either treatment alone (Fig. 5B, p<0.0001) and was consistent with synergy between radiation and nelfinavir as demonstrated by a synergy assessment ratio (\u00a1\u00be SEM) of 1.5 \u00a1\u00be 0.27 as determined by the fractional product method (Fig. 5C). In addition, the slopes of the tumor volume curves after completion of all treatments (day 10) differed significantly (p=<.0001) consistent with synergy between radiation and nelfinavir. Consistent with the survival of some tumor cells after the initial treatment, a repopulation with similar growth rates was observed after day 20. However, tumor volumes in the nelfinavir plus radiation treatment were consistently significantly reduced in comparison to controls consistent with synergy between radiation and nelfinavir. Collectively, these data support a model in which blockade of an activated PI3K/Akt pro-survival pathway mediates radiation sensitization and provides evidence that drugs such as nelfinavir or other novel agents targeting this pathway may be efficacious radiosensitizers worthy of further study. DISCUSSION. EGFR and/or HER2 are overexpressed in a significant number of pancreatic cancers (4-8) and blockade of EGFR or HER2 inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro (9-11). Erlotinib has been approved for the treatment of pancreatic cancer (3) and its role as a radiosensitizer is currently being studied in clinical trials. Due to the growing evidence supporting the ability of pharmacological inhibitors of EGFR and HER2 to radiosensitize multiple types of cancers including breast, HNSCC, colon, and pancreas [reviewed in (13)], and due to overexpression of both EGFR and HER2 in pancreatic cancer, we hypothesized that dual inhibition of EGFR and HER2 with lapatinib would sensitize pancreatic cancer to radiation. In our preliminary studies, we sought to determine whether inhibition of both EGFR and HER2 with lapatinib would be superior to inhibition of EGFR alone with erlotinib. As expected, lapatinib had an improved proliferative IC 50 in cell lines with high HER2 mRNA levels and had a similar IC 50 as erlotinib in cells with high levels of EGFR mRNA. Thus, we chose to study the ability of lapatinib to radiosensitize pancreatic cancer. Intriguingly, we found that lapatinib was an effective radiosensitizer in only the T3M4 line that did not harbor a mutant form of K-ras despite its ability to block EGFR and HER2 activation (Fig. 1A), cellular proliferation (Table 1), and soft agar growth (B. Calvo, unpublished data) in multiple cell lines. This was consistent with the results reported recently by Morgan et al. in which erlotinib radiosensitized a single cell line expressing wild-type K-ras (22). Due to the expression of mutated K-ras in >90% of pancreatic cancers (32, 33), our data suggests that targeting EGFR and HER2 in a clinical trial is unlikely to be a successful strategy for radiosensitization of pancreatic cancer. Given the wealth of evidence supporting resistance of K-ras mutated cancers to EGFR targeted therapies [reviewed in (48)], this finding is not surprising. The differential effect of lapatinib on growth inhibition and radiosensitization adds to evidence that the downstream signaling pathways responsible for these biological responses can be uncoupled. We have previously shown that ERK inhibition correlates with both growth inhibition and radiosensitization in EGFR overexpressing breast cancer cell lines (14) while HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines show growth delay but not radiosensitization in response to therapies that inhibit Akt (manuscript in preparation). These differences may depend upon alternative activation of intracellular feedback loops via collateral pathway activation, a mechanism of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors recently described by several groups (40, 41). We have shown that lapatinib decreased Akt-activation in T3M4 cells and that overexpression of activated K-ras in these cells abrogated the ability of lapatinib to both inhibit Akt and radiosensitize these cells. Direct inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway radiosensitized all cells independent of their K-ras mutational status while inhibition of MER/ERK signaling had no effect on the radiation sensitivity of any cell line tested. These results add support to the growing body of evidence that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a vital role in radiosensitization (17, 34, 42, 49-52) and provides further evidence that Akt inhibitors may be promising clinical radiosensitizers. Finally, we show that nelfinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor blocked Akt activation and radiosensitized both wild-type and mutant K-ras containing cells at concentrations attainable in humans (47). The radiation enhancement ratio of nelfinavir ranged from 1.2 to 1.4, values that can result in a large cumulative effect when applied over many daily fractions of radiation (Fig. 5D). Using a xenograft system, we demonstrated that oral nelfinavir decreased intra-tumor Akt activation in vivo and synergized with clinically relevant fractionated radiation doses. The exact mechanism of action of nelfinavir remains unclear. In addition, whether all HIV protease inhibitors share a common mechanism of radiosensitization remains untested. Saquinavir, a compound in the class of HIV protease inhibitors has been shown to block proteasome function stabilizing I\u00a5\u00eaB, and decreasing NF\u00a5\u00eaB in glioblastoma and prostate cancer cell lines (18). Others have pointed to a role of the ER stress response and/or the unfolded protein response resulting in phosphatase activation and Akt dephosphorylation in a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line (44). Both decreased Akt and NF\u00a5\u00eaB activation can contribute to radiosensitization. In addition, HIV protease inhibitors may enhance tumor oxygenation through inhibition of HIF-1 and VEGF as demonstrated in glioblastoma, lung carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, thus rendering tumors more sensitive to radiation regardless of effects on intracellular signaling pathways (43, 45). The potential cell line specific differences in mechanism highlight the importance of studying potential treatments in multiple systems. These results provide valuable information in support of the use of nelfinavir as a clinically relevant radiosensitizer for pancreatic cancer. While a small phase I trial combining radiation and nelfinavir with increasing doses of gemcitabine has recently been completed (53) this trial was not designed to determine the biologically effective dose of nelfinavir. In addition, the tolerability of adding nelfinavir, or other novel Akt inhibitors, to radiation and 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine, a common regimen used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer deserves further study. While we have delineated the PI3K/Akt pathway as an important component of radiation sensitization in pancreatic cancer, other signaling pathways downstream of EGFR/HER2, Ras or yet undefined signaling node proteins may also play an important role in this response. It is also possible that the off target effects may play a role in radiosensitization. Several groups have shown that LY294002 inhibits not only PI3K, but at concentrations higher than used in our studies can also inhibit PI3K-like kinases such as DNA-PK, a key regulator of DNA double strand break repair (54, 55). The concomitant use of multiple targeted therapies is being investigated in our lab and others and may result in improved tumor control both locally and distantly. Care must be used in these cases, as drug combinations may result in unexpected therapeutic antagonism, have increased toxicities, and lead to unexpected clinical consequences. While the treatment of metastatic disease remains of critical importance in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, a substantial portion of patients are still dying of local disease, underlying the importance of both improved local and systemic therapies (56). CONCLUSION. We have provided evidence that the high incidence of K-ras mutations in pancreatic cancer makes the use of EGFR and/or HER2 inhibitors as radiosensitizers in this disease unlikely to be efficacious. This is consistent with findings reported by several groups that mutations in K-ras render non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer resistant to EGFR-targeted therapy (reviewed in (57)) and complements data provided by Morgan and colleagues that erlotinib is a radiosensitizer for a wild-type K-ras-containing pancreatic cancer cell line (22). Furthermore, we demonstrate that persistent activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway via constitutively active K-ras correlates with a lack of radiosensitization and that direct inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway results in radiosensitization regardless of K-ras mutational status. Most importantly, nelfinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, both decreases Akt phosphorylation and radiosensitizes several pancreatic cancer cell lines regardless of K-ras mutation status. While most inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt pathway are too toxic for routine clinical use, nelfinavir is routinely used long-term for the treatment of HIV with relatively few side-effects. Additional studies into the tolerability and efficacy of combined treatment with nelfinavir, traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, and radiation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer are warranted.

Response to EGFR-targeted therapies in colorectal cancer patients has been convincingly associated with Kirsten-Ras (K-Ras) mutation status. Current mandatory mutation testing for patient selection is limited to the K-Ras \u00a1\u00aehotspot' codons 12 and 13.  Methods:. Colorectal tumours (n=106) were screened for additional K-Ras mutations, phenotypes compared in transformation and Ras GTPase activating assays and gene and pathway changes induced by individual K-Ras mutants identified by microarray analysis. Taqman-based gene copy number and FISH analyses were used to investigate K-Ras gene amplification.  Results:. Four additional K-Ras mutations (Leu 19Phe (1 out of 106 tumours), Lys 117Asn (1 out of 106), Ala 146Thr (7 out of 106) and Arg 164Gln (1 out of 106)) were identified. Lys 117Asn and Ala 146Thr had phenotypes similar to the hotspot mutations, whereas Leu 19Phe had an attenuated phenotype and the Arg 164Gln mutation was phenotypically equivalent to wt K-Ras. We additionally identified a new K-Ras gene amplification event, present in approximately 2% of tumours.  Conclusions:. The identification of mutations outwith previously described hotspot codons increases the K-Ras mutation burden in colorectal tumours by one-third. Future mutation screening to facilitate optimal patient selection for treatment with EGFR-targeted therapies should therefore be extended to codon 146, and in addition should consider the unique molecular signatures associated with individual K-Ras mutations. Colorectal cancer accounts for approximately 15% of all cancers diagnosed annually in the United Kingdom, and is a major cause of death due to cancer, second only to lung and breast cancer (http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/incidence). The majority of colorectal tumours arise from adenomatous polyps (adenomas), benign precursor lesions that develop from normal colonic mucosa. However, fewer than 10% of colorectal adenomas develop into invasive cancers and a number of molecular mechanisms including epigenetic events, DNA mismatch-repair defects, chromosomal rearrangements and mutations in key oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes have been suggested to regulate progression from adenoma to adenocarcinoma (de la Chapelle, 2004). A genetic model for colorectal cancer highlighted key genes, including the tumour suppressor genes adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and p53 and the oncogene Kirsten-Ras (K-Ras), the progressive acquisition of mutations in which was proposed to regulate the adenoma-carcinoma transition (Vogelstein et al, 1988). We subsequently refined this model (Smith et al, 2002), highlighting a significant increase in K-Ras mutation frequency in Dukes' C tumours, suggesting that K-Ras mutation status may be an important determinant of tumour progression. We additionally used comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) analysis to identify common chromosomal aberrations in colorectal tumours, and highlighted an amplification of the region of chromosome 12p where the K-Ras gene is localised (Leslie et al, 2003). We and others have shown that K-Ras mutations are associated with significantly reduced survival in colorectal cancer patients (Andreyev et al, 2001; Conlin et al, 2005), although previous data is not entirely consistent (Etienne-Grimaldi et al, 2008; Winder et al, 2009). K-Ras mutation status has recently been convincingly associated with response to the new generation EGFR antagonists cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix), where response is preferentially observed in wt K-Ras tumours (Lievre et al, 2006; Benvenuti et al, 2007; Khambata-Ford et al, 2007; Freeman et al, 2008; Karapetis et al, 2008; Ramos et al, 2008; Loupakis et al, 2009; Van Cutsem et al, 2009). K-Ras mutation testing is therefore increasingly recommended to facilitate selection of the most appropriate patients for treatment with EGFR antagonists (McNeill, 2008; van Krieken and Tol, 2009). K-Ras is a member of the highly homologous family of small p21 Ras G proteins (H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras) which transduce signals across the plasma membrane, principally by activation of the RAS?RAF?MEK?ERK?MAPK signalling cascade (Figure 1; (Barbacid, 1990)). Ras genes are the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer, where tumour-specific mutations lead to the permanent activation of Ras signalling cascades, influencing proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (Bos, 1989). Previous analyses of K-Ras mutations in human tumours have consistently focussed on single-point mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61, where mutation has been shown to result in reduced Ras GAP GTPase activity, locking the protein in the active Ras-GTP conformation (Ellis and Clark, 2000), although additional mutations at codons 19, 22 and 146 have been described in single colorectal tumour case reports (Orita et al, 1991; Miyakura et al, 2002; Akagi et al, 2007). Ras proteins regulate signal transduction by activating a number of downstream effector proteins, including the cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase B-Raf (Figure 1). B-Raf mutations have also been identified in human cancers, including melanoma and thyroid, ovarian and colorectal tumours, although mutation frequency estimates in colorectal tumours vary from 1 to 20%, and have been particularly associated with tumours deficient in mismatch-repair activity (Wellbrock et al, 2004). The most common B-Raf mutation is a T to A transversion, resulting in a valine to glutamic acid substitution (V600E), present in approximately 90% of B-Raf mutant tumours (Davies et al, 2002), which results in a 500-fold increase in in vitro kinase activity and the induction of cell proliferation and transformation (Wan et al, 2004). Although K-Ras and B-Raf mutations are found in the same tumour types, they are thought to be mutually exclusive (Wellbrock et al, 2004), providing distinct but related mechanisms for the activation of K-Ras signalling pathways. B-Raf mutation status has also recently been associated with response to cetuximab and panitumumab where, like K-Ras, clinical response is limited to wt B-Raf tumours (Di Nicolantonio et al, 2008). As K-Ras mutations in colorectal tumours are clearly important biomarkers of tumour progression and patient survival and also influence response to new generation EGFR antagonists, we have used a variety of experimental approaches to further investigate inter-individual differences in K-Ras mutation burden. Materials and methods.  Study participants. Patients (age range 45?80 years, median age 67 years, 64 males and 42 females) undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee or Perth Royal Infirmary were invited to participate in the study. All patients were Caucasian, had pre-operative pathological confirmation of diagnosis (ICD-9 classification 153.0?153.9, 154.0?154.1) and had no history of previous cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis or diverticular disease. Patient details have been described previously (Smith et al, 2002). The study was approved by the Tayside Committee on Medical Research Ethics and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.  DNA preparation. Primary colorectal tumour resection specimens were brought fresh from theatre to pathology and tumours selected by an experienced pathologist and stored in liquid nitrogen before analysis. Genomic DNA for mutation analysis was extracted using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Southampton, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All study participants provided a 10ml venous blood sample, which was stored in EDTA blood containers at ?20\u00a1\u00c6C. Genomic DNA was extracted from 200\u00a5\u00ecl of whole blood, using a QIAamp 96 spin blood kit (Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  K-Ras and B-Raf mutation detection. Methods for K-Ras and B-Raf mutation detection and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of mutation frequencies are given in Appendix A.  Cell culture and transfection. The mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 was obtained from Cancer Research UK cell services. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum unless otherwise stated, at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in 5% CO 2. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Mammalian expression plasmids. The pEF.6 plink and pEFHA wt K-Ras plasmids were kind gifts from Professor Richard Marais (Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK). Site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) was carried out on the pEFHA wt K-Ras plasmid using the QuikChange II SDM kit (Agilent, South Queensferry, Edinburgh, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate the following K-Ras mutations: G 12V, G 12D, G 13D, Q 61H, L 19F, K 117N, A 146T and R 164Q, using the oligonucleotide primers described in Table 1.  K-Ras foci formation assays. NIH3T3 cells were seeded at 2.5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells in 35mm culture dishes and allowed to adhere overnight before transfection with 250ng of either pEF.6, pEFHA (wt K-Ras) or plasmids containing one of the following K-Ras mutants: G 12V, G 12D, G 13D, Q 61H, L 19F, K 117N, A 146T or R 164Q. After 24h, cells were trypsinised and split (1:3) between two 10cm 3 plates and grown in DMEM containing 5% calf serum for 21 days, then fixed with methanol and stained with 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet. Foci greater then 5mm were counted manually. All transfections were repeated three times and average foci counts and standard deviations calculated.  Ras GTPase activating assays. Ras activity was determined using a Ras activation assay kit (Millipore, Watford, Hertfordshire, UK). Briefly, cells were harvested 48h after transfection in an Mg-containing lysis buffer (MLB). 500\u00a5\u00ecg of cell lysate from each sample was incubated with 10\u00a5\u00ecg of Raf-1 RBD agarose at 4\u00a1\u00c6C for 30min with gentle rocking. After washing three times with MLB, the agarose beads were re-suspended in 40\u00a5\u00ecl of NuPage LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), and 20\u00a5\u00ecl of each sample separated on SDS-PAGE. A total of 30\u00a5\u00ecg of whole-cell lysate was additionally separated by SDS?PAGE for the analysis of total K-Ras expression.  Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed 48h after transfection with MKK lysis buffer (20mM Tris-acetate, 1mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1mM EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) \u00a5\u00e2-mercaptoethanol, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 1mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1mM sodium \u00a5\u00e2-glycerophosphate, 5mM sodium fluoride and protease inhibitors). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13000r.p.m. for 15min at 4\u00a1\u00c6C and the soluble fraction transferred to a fresh 1.5ml Eppendorf tube. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK). For western blot analysis, 30\u00a5\u00ecg of each cell lysate was separated using the NuPage electrophoresis system (12% pre-cast polyacrylamide gels, Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Maidstone, Kent, UK). Membranes were probed with anti-K-Ras (Merck, Nottingham, UK) and anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) antibodies overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (anti-mouse, Dako or anti-goat, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were applied for 1h at room temperature before developing the membranes using enhanced chemiluminescence.  RNA transcription profiling analysis. NIH3T3 cells were plated at 2.5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells per well in a 6-well plate and, following overnight attachment, transfected with 250ng of pEF, wt K-Ras or one of the K-Ras mutants: G12V, G12D, G12C, G13D, Q61H, L19F, K117N, A146T and R164Q. After 48h, cells were harvested in 1ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and total RNA extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was further purified using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), eluted in a final volume of 50\u00a5\u00ecl RNAse-free dH 20 and RNA quality and concentration assessed with a Bioanalyzer 2100 using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (Agilent). RNA labelling and microarray hybridisation was carried out in collaboration with CXR Biosciences, Dundee, UK. Briefly 1\u00a5\u00ecg of total RNA sample was amplified to generate complementary RNA (cRNA) and labelled with cyanine 3-CTP (Cys3) using the QuickAmp labelling kit, one-colour (Agilent). Labelled cRNA was hybridised to Agilent 4 \u00a1\u00bf 44K Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray slides, which were scanned on an Agilent Microarray Scanner and images processed using Agilent Feature Extraction Software v9.1. Microarray data was analysed using the open-source software Bioconducter 2.2. Lists of differentially expressed genes were generated comparing each of the K-Ras mutants with empty vector control using probes that exhibited an adjusted p value (false discovery rate (FDR)) 0.05. Hierarchical clustering analysis was carried out using \u00a1\u00aeCluster' (open source clustering software) and clusters visualised using Java TreeView.  K-Ras gene copy number assay. A new Taqman gene expression assay to evaluate K-Ras gene copy number was designed, in which K-Ras copy number was compared with the endogenous control gene RNAse P (copy number 2). K-Ras was amplified from genomic DNA extracted from normal and tumour tissues (n=96 normal/tumour pairs) from our colorectal patient series (Smith et al, 2002) with the oligonucleotide primers 5\u00a1\u00c7-TTTAATACTTTTTATGTATTTCAGGGTGTTG-3\u00a1\u00c7 (300nM) and 5\u00a1\u00c7-TTACCATCTTTGCTCATCTTTTCTTTAT-3\u00a1\u00c7 (300nM) and Taqman probe 5\u00a1\u00c7-FAM-TGATGCCTTCTATACATTAGTTCGAGAAATTCGAAAA-TAMRA-3\u00a1\u00c7 (100nM), and expression compared with RNAse P by the comparative Ct method, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK).  Fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis. Sections (4\u00a5\u00ecM) of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissue were provided by Tayside Tissue Bank on positively charged slides, which had been baked overnight at 56\u00a1\u00c6C. Sections were deparaffinised using an automated protocol on a Vysis VP2000 processor, placed into a coplin-containing pre-warmed pre-treatment solution (Vysis, Maidenhead, Kent, UK) and incubated at 80\u00a1\u00c6C for 30min. Slides were then washed at room temperature in water for 1min, before two 5min washes in 2 \u00a1\u00bf SSC before digestion with protease buffer at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 65min. Following digestion, slides were washed three times in 2 \u00a1\u00bf SSC for 2min, before sequential washes in 70, 85 and 100% ethanol for 2min each at room temperature and dried on a 37\u00a1\u00c6C block. Meanwhile, 1\u00a5\u00ecl chromosome 12p BAC RP11-707G18 (Red) (BlueGnome), 1\u00a5\u00ecl chromosome 12q BAC RP11-89H19 (Green) (BlueGnome) and 9\u00a5\u00ecl LSI?WCP hybridisation buffer (Vysis) was mixed together for each slide and pipetted onto a 22 \u00a1\u00bf 22mm coverslip which was placed onto a region of the slide containing tumour tissue and placed onto a heat block at 75\u00a1\u00c6C for 5min to co-denature the probes and tumour tissue. Rubber cement was then applied to seal the coverslips and slides placed into a humidified hybridisation chamber in a 37\u00a1\u00c6C incubator overnight. The next morning, coverslips were removed and slides placed into 0.4 \u00a1\u00bf SSC at 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 90s and transferred to 2 \u00a1\u00bf SSC containing 0.005% Tween for 30s before being left to dry in the dark. In all, 20\u00a5\u00ecl of DAPI stain was then applied to coverslips, which were then gently applied to each slide and, after removing air bubbles, sealed with clear nail varnish. Slides were analysed on an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX60), where probe signals from 20 different cells in three different regions of the tumour tissue were counted and the average number of probe signals and s.d. calculated. Results.  Identification of new K-Ras mutations. We have previously described K-Ras mutations at codons 12, 13 and 61 in a series of 106 unselected colorectal tumours (Smith et al, 2002). Our K-Ras mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing of K-Ras exon 1 (codons 12 and 13) and exon 2 (codon 61), and would therefore have detected any additional mutations in these exons. Codon 12 mutations were detected in 23 tumours (21.7%) and codon 13 mutations in 6 tumours (5.7%), whereas no codon 61 mutations were detected. Mutations at codon 19 (G 57T, Leu 19Phe) and in B-Raf (V600E) were found in single tumours (Table 2). To identify additional K-Ras mutations, and to establish the relative frequencies of individual K-Ras mutations in human colorectal tumours, we used WAVE analysis followed by direct sequencing to screen the same tumour series for mutations in K-Ras exon 3 and exon 4B, the most common exon 4 splice variant. Four additional sequence changes were identified ? an A to C change (Lys to Asn substitution) at codon 117, a G to A change (Ala to Thr substitution) at codon 146, a G to A change (Arg to Gln substitution) at codon 164 and a \u00a1\u00aesilent' C to T nucleotide substitution, which did not alter the aspartic acid residue at codon 173 (Table 2). Together, these K-Ras mutations and the B-Raf V600E mutation increase overall Ras pathway mutation frequency from 27.4 to 37.8%. The predicted localisation of each mutation in the functional domains of the K-Ras protein is illustrated in Figure 2. To determine whether our reported sequence changes represented tumour-specific mutations or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genomic DNA from blood and tumour tissue was compared. Sequence changes at codons 19, 117, 146 and 164 were only detected in tumour DNA, whereas the codon 173 sequence change was detected in both blood and tumour DNA, and therefore represented a SNP (Table 2). To determine the frequencies of the codon 117, 146 and 164 K-Ras mutations and the codon 173 SNP, PCR?RFLP assays were designed to permit rapid screening of blood and tumour DNA (Appendix A). Like the codon 19 mutation, the codon 117 and codon 164 mutations were found in single tumours, whereas the codon 146 mutation was found in 7 out of 106 (6.5%) of tumours. No tumours with codon 19, 117, 146 or 146 mutations had additional K-Ras mutations in codons 12, 13 or 61. The codon 173 SNP was found in 39 individuals, predicting an allele frequency of 18.2%. As this SNP did not lead to an amino acid substitution in the K-Ras protein, it was not analysed further.  Comparison of phenotypes associated with hotspot and new K-Ras mutations.  Focus formation assays. Phenotypes associated with the various K-Ras mutations have previously not been systematically evaluated. To compare the transformation potential of the K-Ras mutants, therefore, NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing wt K-Ras and the K-Ras mutations G12V, G12D, G13D, Q61H, L19F, K117N, A146T and R164Q. Equivalence of plasmid loading was assessed spectrophotometrically and by western blotting for K-Ras (data not shown). Cells were stained with crystal violet and foci counted 21 days after transfection, as described in Materials and Methods (Figure 3). No foci were observed in untransfected cells or in cells transfected with wt K-Ras, whereas abundant foci were seen with each hotspot K-Ras mutation (Figure 3A). Codon 12 mutations had slightly greater transforming potential than codon 13 mutations and consistently greater transforming potential than the codon 61 Q61H mutation (Figure 3C). After transfection of additional K-Ras mutations, significant focus formation was observed for codon 117 and 146 mutations (Figure 3B). In contrast, the codon 164 mutation was phenotypically equivalent to wt K-ras with no evidence of foci formation and the codon 19 mutation generated low but consistent numbers of isolated foci (Figure 3C).  Ras activating assays. To assess which K-Ras mutations were in the active GTP-bound conformation, a Raf-1 binding assay was carried out as described in Materials and Methods. Raf-1 selectively binds GTP-bound Ras (rather than the inactive GDP-bound form) which, following immunoprecipitation, can be visualised by western blotting. Figure 4 illustrates the results of our analysis where, consistent with our focus formation experiments, the K-Ras G12V and L19F, K117N and A146T mutations are clearly in the active GTP-bound conformation. In contrast, the R164Q mutation, like wt K-Ras, was not GTP-bound.  RNA transcription-profiling experiments. To further compare and contrast the phenotypes associated with each of the K-Ras mutants, transcription-profiling experiments were carried out as described in Materials and Methods. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed the presence of two major gene clusters, \u00a1\u00aecluster 1' containing the G12V, G12C and G12D mutants and \u00a1\u00aecluster 2' containing G13D, A146T, K117N, R164Q and L19F (Figure 5). It is interesting to note that the codon 12 mutants were most similar to wt K-Ras, whereas the K117N and A146T mutants clustered with the activating codon 13 and codon 61 hotspot mutants. The L19F and R164Q mutants formed a subcluster within cluster 2 suggesting, consistent with our foci formation data, that these mutants are phenotypically distinct from the G13D, A146T and K117N mutants. The presence of L19F in cluster 2 is consistent with our Ras GTPase assay data whereas, in contrast, our experimental data for R164Q predicted a \u00a1\u00aewt' Ras phenotype. The presence of R164Q in cluster 2, rather than in cluster 1 with wt K-Ras was therefore initially surprising, but suggests that the R164Q mutation also has an \u00a1\u00aeactivating' phenotype, albeit attenuated relative to the other mutations studied. To further investigate the phenotypes associated with each of the K-Ras mutants, the expression of a diverse selection of genes associated a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction, cytoskeleton remodelling and cell adhesion was compared. Although further analysis of this complex dataset, including composite analysis of biological pathways and processes is ongoing and will be discussed in more detail in a future manuscript, representative examples of genes showing differential expression following the introduction of each K-Ras mutant are summarised in Table 3. Consistent with our hierarchical clustering analysis, introduction of the R164Q mutation led to relatively few changes in gene expression or showed reduced pathway activation compared with the other mutants studied. However, there were examples of genes that were induced by all of the mutants studied, including the protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptpre and the Rho GTPase activating protein Arhgap6, and multiple examples of genes induced or repressed by all of the mutants with the exception of R164Q. These included the MAPK phosphatases DUSP4 and DUSP6, Ereg, Hbegf and Btc, all involved in EGFR binding, the Rho guanine-exchange factor NGEF, cell adhesion molecule Ceacam 1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor Serpinb2. Consistently, the novel A146T and K117N mutants (and, to a lesser extent, the L19F mutant) clustered with and influenced gene expression similarly to the previously described activating G13D and Q61H \u00a1\u00aehotspot' mutations. Of particular interest were genes, for example, Vegfa, Pak3, Pim1 and EII2 which were differentially expressed by cluster 1 but not cluster 2 mutants, genes, for example, Spry4, Igf1R, Creb1 and Tcf4 which were differentially expressed by cluster 2 mutants, and additional genes, for example, Jun, E2F2, Mmp3 and Glut-1 which were differentially regulated by each mutant studied.  K-Ras gene amplification. To investigate whether altered K-Ras activity could additionally result from gene amplification, a K-Ras gene copy number assay was designed and carried out as described in Materials and Methods and K-Ras copy number compared in normal and tumour tissues. In total, 2 of the 96 tumour pairs analysed (2.1%) showed tumour-specific copy number increases (Figure 6), one (study code 1264, wt K-Ras) with 4 tumour copies of K-Ras and the other (study code 1233, wt K-Ras) with 27 copies of the K-Ras gene. Assay reproducibility and linearity was demonstrated from the analysis of standard curves generated by serial dilutions of a wide concentration range of input genomic DNA (data not shown). K-Ras gene amplification was confirmed by FISH analysis as described in Materials and Methods (Figure 7). Figures 7A and B illustrate chromosome metaphase spreads confirming FISH probe specificities for chromosomes 12p and 12q, respectively, whereas Figures 7C and D show representative colorectal tumour FISH analysis. Figure 7C illustrates a tumour sample (study code 1271) in which the K-Ras gene is not amplified (red fluorescence=green fluorescence), whereas Figure 7D illustrates a colorectal tumour (study code 1264) with K-Ras gene amplification (red fluorescence>green fluorescence). Signals from the red 12p12.1 probe in tumour 1264 appear as a cluster of bright dots forming a line which is suggestive of a homogeneously staining region (HSR), a chromosomal region which is amplified either on the original chromosome or on another chromosome, as opposed to double minutes where the amplified gene is located in extra-chromosomal circular DNA molecules. Discussion. Recent clinical data has shown a compelling association between K-Ras and B-Raf mutation status and response to EGFR blockade by cetuximab and panitumumab in the treatment of metastatic colorectal tumours (Benvenuti et al, 2007; Khambata-Ford et al, 2007; Freeman et al, 2008; Karapetis et al, 2008; Ramos et al, 2008). K-Ras mutations in colorectal tumours have been extensively documented, where recent meta analysis of more than 3000 tumours estimates an average K-Ras mutation frequency of 34.8% (Andreyev et al, 2001). This and the majority of previous analyses were, however, limited to codons 12 and 13, whereas only a minority of studies have additionally analysed codon 61. Although additional K-Ras mutations have been reported outwith these \u00a1\u00aehotspot' codons, to our knowledge, there has been no systematic analysis of K-Ras mutation frequency in human colorectal tumours. Our use of \u00a1\u00aeWAVE' denaturing HPLC (dHPLC) analysis (Kuklin et al, 1997) allowed us to carry out a rapid, systematic analysis of the entire K-Ras coding sequence to identify colorectal tumours with sequence changes, the nature which were subsequently confirmed by conventional dideoxy sequencing. Our data clearly demonstrates that K-Ras mutations in human colorectal tumours are likely to be significantly underestimated if only hotspot codons are analysed. Indeed, current mutation screening tests based on the hotspot codons 12 and 13 are likely to result in the mis-classification of up to one-third of patients. Although mutations at codons 19, 117 and 164 are relatively rare events, our data suggests that each K-Ras mutation may differentially influence treatment response. We would therefore recommend the adoption of comprehensive K-Ras mutation profiling, or at least the routine inclusion of the codon 146 mutation, for patient selection for cetuximab and related therapies. Current data from the COSMIC database, which summarises literature data and the ongoing Sanger cancer-genome project describes 29 K-Ras colorectal tumour mutations outwith codons 12, 13 and 61, and more than 11800 mutations at these hotspot codons (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/), but does not describe associated phenotypes. Consistent with our own data, codon 146 was the most frequently mutated of the mutations described. K-Ras codon 146 mutations have been described in a human colorectal tumour cell line (Higashi et al, 1990), in mice with thymic lymphomas (Sloan et al, 1990) and in a single human colorectal tumour case report (Orita et al, 1991). In more detailed molecular profiling studies, codon 146 mutations were described in 4% of two independent colorectal tumour series from Hong Kong and the United States of America (Edkins et al, 2006) and in chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (Gelsi-Boyer et al, 2008; Tyner et al, 2009). Consistent with our own data, Tyner et al (2009) reported an oncogenic phenotype associated with the K-Ras 146 mutation in leukaemia and Loupakis et al (2009) have recently reported that a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer with a K-Ras 146 mutation was resistant to cetuximab. There is only a single report of K-Ras codon 19 mutations in human colorectal tumours (Akagi et al, 2007), in which in vitro elevation of active Ras-GTP levels, anchorage-independent growth and increased tumourigenicity in nude mice was demonstrated. A codon 19 mutation has additionally been described in H-Ras in a human pituitary carcinoma metastases (Pei et al, 1994). There are two recent reports of codon 117 mutations ? the first in K-Ras in human colorectal tumours (Wojcik et al, 2008) and the second in H-Ras, associated with activation of the RAS?MAPK pathway and the mental retardation Costello syndrome (Denayer et al, 2008). It is interesting to note that Costello syndrome has been associated with increased cancer predisposition (Gripp, 2005). There are no reports of K-Ras 164 mutations, and mutations at this codon were not identified by Sanger cancer genome project investigators. Recent clinical data convincingly associates response to anti-EGFR therapies with K-Ras mutation status in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer where, logically, response is preferentially observed in K-Ras wt tumours (Lievre et al, 2006; Benvenuti et al, 2007; Khambata-Ford et al, 2007; Freeman et al, 2008; Karapetis et al, 2008; Ramos et al, 2008; Loupakis et al, 2009; Van Cutsem et al, 2009) which retain the ability to respond to EGFR blockade. Our description of K-Ras gene amplification in a subset of wt tumours is of particular interest in this regard as increased K-Ras gene copy number may lead to a more active \u00a1\u00aemutation'-like phenotype. Experiments to investigate this possibility are currently underway in our laboratory. It is interesting to note that our transcription profiling analysis revealed some similarities but many marked differences in gene expression following the introduction of the individual K-Ras mutants. We found that the codon 117 and the common codon 146 mutations cluster with the previously described activating mutations at codons 13 and 61, highlighting differences in individual mutation phenotypes. Our analysis of K-Ras induced gene expression identified a number of genes previously associated with K-Ras signalling, for example the MAPK dual specificity phosphatases DUSP4 and DUSP6. DUSPs are key regulators of the balance between kinase pathway activation and inactivation, and have previously been reported to be upregulated in an adaptive response, creating a negative feedback loop following MAPK pathway activation (Keyse, 2008). Consistent with our own data, DUSP4 expression has previously been shown to be increased in pancreatic tumours with K-Ras mutations (Yip-Schneider et al, 2001) and DUSP6 expression increased in a variety of tumour types with mutations in Ras or Raf pathway genes (Croonquist et al, 2003; Warmka et al, 2004; Bloethner et al, 2005). Of particular interest, however, was our observation that certain signalling cascades, including those mediated by Igf1 and Vegf, were differentially activated by cluster 1 and cluster 2 K-Ras mutants, suggesting that not only the presence but the specific molecular characteristics of individual K-Ras mutations may be important determinants of both tumour progression and treatment response. For example, recent data suggests that glucose deprivation can promote the acquisition of K-Ras mutations in human tumours and reports upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT-1 in K-Ras mutant tumours (Yun et al, 2009). Our data confirms this hypothesis, but shows GLUT-1 induction restricted to the codon 12, 13, 61 and 117 mutations, with no change in GLUT-1 expression associated with the introduction of codon 19, 146 or 164 mutations, again reflecting phenotypic heterogeneity. Current clinical data is sufficiently compelling that K-Ras mutation testing to facilitate the selection of patients most likely to benefit from anti-EGFR therapy is increasingly recommended in clinical practise (McNeill, 2008; van Krieken and Tol, 2009), and has resulted in a recent formal recommendation from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network that patients with K-Ras tumour mutations should not be treated with cetuximab or panitumumab (McNeill, 2008). There is increasing interest in the identification of prognostic molecular markers, which may be used to select the most appropriate patients for adjuvant chemotherapy or to identify colorectal cancer patients at increased risk of disease progression. Although the clinical implications of non-hotspot K-Ras mutations requires further validation both as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets, our data suggests that future analysis of K-Ras mutations and quantitation of mutation burden in colorectal tumours should not be limited to previously described mutation hotspots and should additionally consider the unique molecular signatures associated with individual K-Ras mutations.

Appendix 1. Kirsten-Ras (K-Ras) mutation detection and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of mutation frequencies  K-Ras Exon 3 and Exon 4 mutation detection. Mutations in exons 3 and 4 of the K-Ras gene were identified using the Transgenomic WAVE denaturing HPLC system. PCR products for WAVE analysis were generated using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche, Welingkar garden, UK) incorporating Taq polymerase with enhanced proofreading activity. A 200bp PCR product encompassing K-Ras exon 3 was generated using the oligonucleotide primers 5\u00a1\u00c7-TTCTTTCCCAGAGAACAAATTAA-3\u00a1\u00c7 and 5\u00a1\u00c7-AGATCTGTATTTATTTCAGTGTTACTTACC-3\u00a1\u00c7. Similarly, a 261bp PCR product encompassing K-Ras Exon 4b was generated using the oligonucleotide primers 5\u00a1\u00c7-TACTTTTTATGTATTTCAGGGTGTTG-3\u00a1\u00c7 and 5\u00a1\u00c7-GCTAACAGTCTGCATGGAGC-3\u00a1\u00c7. Assay conditions (acetonitrile gradient and temperature profile) were optimised for WAVE analysis of each PCR fragment using Transgenomic WAVEMAKER 4.1 software, according to the manufacturer's instructions. K-Ras exon 3 was analysed at 55\u00a1\u00c6C with an initial concentration of 51% Buffer B (0.1M TEAA, 25% acetonitrile) and exon 4 at 55\u00a1\u00c6C with an initial concentration of 54% Buffer B. All samples were denatured and cooled slowly to room temperature before WAVE analysis to maximise heteroduplex formation.  Direct sequencing. The K-Ras mutations detected by WAVE analysis were confirmed by direct sequencing of PCR products. This analysis was performed by the DNA analysis facility, Department of Molecular and Cellular Pathology, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK, using 16 capillary ABI 3100 Genetic Analysers (Applied Biosystems). Before sequencing, all PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kits (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All sequences obtained were aligned with previously published sequences (NCBI Genbank Accession Numbers {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"L00047\",\"term_id\":\"190905\",\"term_text\":\"L00047\"}}L00047 and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"L00049\",\"term_id\":\"190907\",\"term_text\":\"L00049\"}}L00049 for K-Ras exons 3 and 4b, respectively); the presence and nature of each mutation was confirmed by repeat PCR and sequencing.  RFLP analysis of K-Ras codon 117 mutations. To permit rapid identification of the K-Ras codon 117 mutation, a PCR?RFLP assay was designed where the presence of the mutation created a recognition site for the restriction enzyme Bsr S1. A 288bp PCR product was amplified using the primers 5\u00a1\u00c7-GATCTTTTGAGAGAGATACAAGGTTTC-3\u00a1\u00c7 and 5\u00a1\u00c7-TGTTCTAGAAGGCAAATCACA-3\u00a1\u00c7. Following PCR amplification, PCR products were digested with Bsr S1 for 2h at 65\u00a1\u00c6C and analysed on 8% polyacrylamide gels, run in 1 \u00a1\u00bf TBE buffer at 200V for 2h. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and DNA bands visualised on a UV transilluminator. Samples without the K-Ras codon 117 mutation were resistant to digestion and produced a single band of 288bp, whereas samples homozygous for the codon 117 mutation were digested to produce bands of 271 and 17bp. Heterozygous samples produced bands of 288, 271 and 17bp. Band sizes were determined by comparison with \u00a5\u00d5X174 DNA size markers (Promega).  RFLP analysis of K-Ras codon 146 mutations. Similarly, a PCR-RFLP assay was designed to identify the K-Ras codon 146 mutation, where the presence of the mutation created a recognition site for the restriction enzyme Mse I. A 197bp PCR product was amplified using the primers 5\u00a1\u00c7 TGG AAT TCC TTT TAT TGA AAC ATC A 3\u00a1\u00c7 and 5\u00a1\u00c7 GAT TAA GAA GCA ATG CCC TCT C 3\u00a1\u00c7. Following PCR amplification, PCR products were digested with Mse1 for 2h at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and analysed on 8% polyacrylamide gels as described above. Samples without the K-Ras codon 146 mutation were digested to produce bands of 101, 91 and 5bp, whereas samples homozygous for the codon 146 mutation produced bands of 91, 78, 23 and 5bp. Heterozygous samples produced bands of 101, 91, 78, 23 and 5bp.  RFLP analysis of K-Ras codon 164 mutations. The presence of the codon 164 mutation was confirmed using a novel RFLP assay, wherein the presence of the mutation destroyed a recognition site for the restriction enzyme BstBI. A 261bp PCR product was generated as described above for K-Ras exon 4B mutation detection. After PCR amplification, PCR products were digested with BstBI for 2h at 65\u00a1\u00c6C and analysed on 2% agarose gels. Samples without the codon 164 mutation were digested to produce bands of 203 and 58bp, whereas samples homozygous for the mutation produced a single band of 261bp. Heterozygous samples produced bands of 261, 203 and 58bp.  RFLP analysis of K-Ras codon 173 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The codon 173 SNP was detected using a novel RFLP assay, where the presence of the mutation destroyed a recognition site for the restriction enzyme BccI. A 261bp PCR product was generated as described above for K-Ras exon 4B mutation detection. After PCR amplification, PCR products were digested with BccI for 2h at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and analysed on 2% agarose gels. Samples without the codon 173 SNP were digested to produce bands of 173 and 88bp, whereas samples homozygous for the codon 173 SNP produced a single band of 261bp. Heterozygous samples produced bands of 261, 173 and 88bp.  RFLP analysis of B-Raf V599E mutation. The B-Raf V599E mutation was detected using a novel RFLP assay, where the presence of the mutation destroyed a recognition site for the restriction enzyme TspRI. A 224bp PCR product was amplified using the primers 5\u00a1\u00c7-TCATAATGCTTGCTCTGATAGGA-3\u00a1\u00c7 and 5\u00a1\u00c7-GGCCAAAAATTTAATCAGTGGA-3\u00a1\u00c7 in a 50ml reaction containing 1 \u00a1\u00bf PCR buffer (Promega), 1.25mM MgCl 2, 200mM dNTPs, 300nM primers, 6% DMSO and 1.5U of Taq polymerase in a PCR as described above. After PCR amplification, PCR products were digested with TspR1 for 2h at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and analysed on 8% polyacrylamide gels as described above. Samples without the B-Raf V599E mutation were digested to produce bands of 124, 78 and 22bp, whereas samples homozygous for the V599E mutation produced bands of 202 and 22bp. Heterozygous samples produced bands of 202, 124, 78 and 22bp. References.",

                "text": "A salicylic acid-based small molecule inhibitor for the oncogenic Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2)\tThe Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) plays a pivotal role in growth factor and cytokine signaling. Gain-of-function SHP2 mutations are associated with Noonan syndrome, various kinds of leukemias and solid tumors. Thus there is considerable interest in SHP2 as a potential target for anti-cancer and anti-leukemia therapy. We report a salicylic acid-based combinatorial library approach aimed to bind both active site and unique nearby sub-pockets for enhanced affinity and selectivity. Screening of the library led to the identification of a SHP2 inhibitor II-B08 (compound 9) with highly efficacious cellular activity. Compound 9 blocks growth factor stimulated ERK1/2 activation and hematopoietic progenitor proliferation, providing supporting evidence that chemical inhibition of SHP2 may be therapeutically useful for anti-cancer and anti-leukemia treatment. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the structure of SHP2 in complex with 9 reveals molecular determinants that can be exploited for the acquisition of more potent and selective SHP2 inhibitors. Introduction. Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation, catalyzed by the coordinated actions of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), is of critical importance to the regulation of signaling events that underlie virtually all essential cellular processes. 1 , 2 Not surprisingly, disturbance of the normal balance between PTK and PTP activity results in aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation, which has been linked to the etiology of several human diseases, including cancer. 3 , 4 For example, abnormal expression and activation of many PTKs, such as epidermal growth factor receptor and proto-oncogene products Src and Abl, are causative factors for a number of malignancies. 5 By catalyzing the removal of the phosphoryl group from tyrosine residues, the PTPs are generally viewed as negative regulators due to their ability to reverse the actions of PTKs, which usually drive signaling cascades. However, mounting genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that some PTPs can potentiate, rather than antagonize, signaling mediated by the PTKs. This mode of synergy enhances mitogenic processes, leading to cell transformation. The Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2, SHP2, is a positive transducer of growth factor, cytokine, integrin, and hormone signaling pathways regulating processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis. 6 , 7 In nearly all cases, the catalytic activity of SHP2 is required for full activation of the Ras?ERK1/2 cascade that is mediated through dephosphorylation of substrates that are negatively regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. 6 - 8 The critical role of SHP2 in cell physiology is further underscored by the identification of mutations within SHP2, which are linked to several human diseases. Thus, germline mutations in SHP2 that cause hyperactivation of its phosphatase activity are associated with 50% Noonan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder that is estimated to occur in 1:1,000 to 1:2,500 live births in the United States and worldwide. 9 , 10 Many Noonan syndrome patients display hematologic abnormalities, including myeloid disorders and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). 10 Somatic gain-of-function mutations in SHP2 occur in 35% of individuals with JMML, as well as in acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 4%), myelodysplastic syndrome (10%), and acute lymphoid leukemia (7%). 11 - 15 In addition to childhood leukemia, SHP2 mutations also occur in adult AML (6%) as well as in solid tumors including lung adenocarcinoma, colon cancer, neuroblastoma, melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. 16 - 18 Finally, SHP2 is also implicated in gastric ulcer and, ultimately, gastric carcinoma caused by Helicobacter pylori, which harbors a key virulence factor CagA that promotes SHP2 activation when it is tyrosine phosphorylated by the host Src family kinases. 19 Collectively, these genetic and biochemical observations identify SHP2 as the first bona fide oncogene in the PTP superfamily. In view of the importance of SHP2 in various kinds of leukemias and solid tumors, SHP2 represents an exciting target for anti-cancer and anti-leukemia therapy. Moreover, given the obligatory requirement of SHP2 function in multiple oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, inhibition of SHP2 may also prove effective for cancers with coactivation of receptor PTKs, which respond poorly to kinase inhibitor monotherapy. 20 Understandably, there is increasing interest in targeting SHP2 for therapeutic development. 21 - 25 However, obtaining SHP2 inhibitors with optimal potency and pharmacological properties has been difficult, due primarily to the highly conserved and positively charged nature of the active site pocket shared by all PTP family members. We describe here a salicylic acid-based combinatorial library approach, which led to the identification of a SHP2 inhibitor II-B08 (compound 9) with highly efficacious cellular activity. This proof-of-principle SHP2 inhibitor blocks growth factor stimulated ERK1/2 activation and hematopoietic progenitor proliferation, validating the concept that chemical inhibition of SHP2 may be therapeutically useful for anti-cancer and anti-leukemia treatment. X-ray crystallographic analysis of compound 9-bound SHP2 structure together with structure and activity studies reveal molecular determinants that can be exploited for the acquisition of more potent and selective SHP2 inhibitors. Results and Discussion. Identification of Compound 9 as a SHP2 Inhibitor from a Salicylic Acid-based Combinatorial Library. As discussed above, SHP2 is an outstanding target for oncology. However, the common architecture of the active site (i.e. pTyr-binding pocket) shared by all PTPs poses a significant problem for the acquisition of selective SHP2 inhibitors. Fortunately, it has been recognized that pTyr alone is not sufficient for high-affinity binding and residues flanking pTyr are important for PTP substrate recognition. 26 These findings point to a conceptual framework for PTP inhibitor design; namely bidentate ligands capable of engaging both the active site and an adjacent less-conserved subpocket for enhanced affinity and selectivity. In principle, active site-directed, potent and selective PTP inhibitors can be devised by tethering a nonhydrolyzable pTyr mimetic to appropriately functionalized moieties to bind both the active site and a unique nearby sub-pocket. 26 , 27 Indeed, a number of potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors have been developed using this strategy. 28 Unfortunately, the highly positively charged pTyr-binding pocket impedes the development of inhibitors with favorable bioavailability. Most of the pTyr mimetics described in the literature are not drug-like, and thus are deficient in cell membrane permeability. Indeed, the lack of cellular efficacy of existing PTP inhibitors represents a major obstacle in developing phosphatase-based therapeutics. Consequently, there is continued interest in developing pTyr mimetics with more acceptable physicochemical properties. We recently discovered from an in silico DOCK screening campaign that the natural product salicylic acid can serve as a pTyr mimetic. 29 We further demonstrated that naphthyl and polyaromatic salicylic acid derivatives exhibit enhanced affinity for PTPs relative to the corresponding single ring compounds. 29 , 30 Therefore, we sought to develop bicyclic salicylic acid-based PTP inhibitors that carry sufficient polar and nonpolar interactions with the active site and yet possess improved pharmacological properties. Bioactive natural products are very promising starting points for drug development because they are evolutionarily selected and validated for interfering and interacting with biological targets. The indole nucleus is a prominent structural scaffold found in numerous natural products and synthetic compounds with vital medicinal value. 31 , 32 To this end, we have focused our attention on indole-based salicylic acids as PTP active site-directed pTyr mimetics. We hypothesized that an indole-based salicylic acid may bind the active site and interact in the desired inhibitory fashion with the PTPs, and additional diversity elements to which the salicylic core is attached to should render the inhibitors PTP isozyme-selective. To target both the active site and an adjacent, peripheral secondary binding site in SHP2, we have developed a salicylic acid-based combinatorial library approach which entails the following criteria: (1) each member will be of a modular, bidentate structure containing both an active site-directed core (the salicylic acid derivative) and a diversity element for interaction with adjacent peripheral sites in SHP2; (2) both the core group and the diversity elements will possess favorable pharmacological properties; and (3) each member will be efficiently assembled in situ for facile screening against SHP2. We chose click chemistry for library construction because it offers an expedient way to connect two components together with high yield and purity under extremely mild conditions. 33 More importantly, the click reaction can be conducted in aqueous solution in the absence of deleterious reagents, thus allowing direct screening and identification of hits from the library. In fact, click chemistry has found increasing applications in lead discovery and optimization for a number of enzymes including the PTPs. 34 - 39 Figure 1 depicts a focused library-based strategy for the acquisition of potent and selective SHP2 inhibitory agents that are capable of bridging both the active site and an adjacent peripheral site. The library contains (a) a salicylic acid core to engage the PTP active site, and (b) 4 alkyl linkers of 1 to 4 methylene unit to tether the pTyr mimetic to (c) a structurally diverse set of amines and hydrazines, aimed at capturing additional interactions with adjacent pockets surrounding the active site. In the interest of keeping the library to a reasonable size, we selected 53 amines and hydrazines that vary by molecular weight, charge, polarity, hydrophobicity, sterics, etc. and therefore provide a reasonable (albeit limited) structural diversity to increase the number and strength of noncovalent interactions between SHP2 and the inhibitor. As shown in Scheme I, the salicylic acid core 1 was synthesized in 8 steps with Sonogashira coupling and an electrophilic cyclization as key steps. After esterification of 4-aminosalicylic acid with dimethyl sulfate, compound 2 was isolated in 86% yield which was then treated with paraformaldehyde and NaCNBH 3 to give the product N, N-dimethyl-aniline 3 with good yield. Selective iodination of compound 3 with iodine gave methyl 4-(dimethylamino)-2-hydroxy-5-iodobenzoate 4, which was then coupled with the commercially available phenylacetene with Sonogashira coupling to afford compound 5 with excellent yield. Compound 6 was constructed by electrophilic cyclization of 5 with iodine in 89% yield. Key compound 7 was generated through another Pd(0)-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of compound 6 with trimethylsilyacetylene. Finally, sequential removal of the protective groups in compound 7 with TBAF and KOH gave the salicylic acid core 1. To increase potency and selectivity, the strategically positioned alkyne in salicylic acid core 1 was tethered to 212 different azide-containing diversity elements (53 discrete amines and hydrazines (Figure 2) with 4 alkyl linkers of 1 to 4 methylene length), using click chemistry or the Cu(I)-catalyzed [3+2] azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction (Figure 1). The azide-containing building blocks were synthesized in a one-pot procedure (Scheme II), in which amines or hydrazines were reacted with the acyl chloride linkers in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), followed by S N2 reaction with sodium azide to generate the corresponding azides. To construct the 212-member library, each azide (32 mM) was coupled with the alkyne containing core 1 (26.6 mM) in the presence of 1.33 mM CuSO 4 and 6.64 mM sodium ascorbate and 0.798 mM TBTA (tris-(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine) in the 0.5 mL solvent (THF: t-BuOH: H 2O = 1 : 1 : 1) at room temperature for 12 hours. The products were assessed by LC-MS and used directly for screening without further purification (the purity was in the range of 40-70%). The ability of the library compounds to inhibit the SHP2-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was assessed at pH 7 and 25 \u00a1\u00c6C. Out of the 212-member library, 5 compounds displayed measurable inhibitory activity at \u00a1\u00ad10 \u00a5\u00ecM concentration. Resynthesis of the hits confirmed that they were genuine inhibitors for SHP2 with IC 50 values in the low \u00a5\u00ecM range (Table 1). These values compare very favorable to the alkyne-containing salicylic acid core, which displays an IC 50 of 212 \u00a1\u00be 23 \u00a5\u00ecM for SHP2. The results indicate that the linker and amine diversity element contribute significantly to SHP2 binding. In addition, the structure and activity data revealed that compounds with substituted biphenyls as the diversity elements were preferentially selected by SHP2. Compound 9 (Table 1) appeared to be the most potent for SHP2 with an IC 50 of 5.5 \u00a1\u00be 0.4 \u00a5\u00ecM, and was selected for further characterization. Kinetic analysis indicated that 9 is a reversible and noncompetitive inhibitor for SHP2 with a K i of 5.2 \u00a1\u00be 0.3 \u00a5\u00ecM (Figure 3). To determine the specificity for 9, its inhibitory activity toward a panel of mammalian PTPs including cytosolic PTPs, SHP1, PTP1B, Lyp, HePTP and FAP1, the receptor-like PTPs, CD45, LAR, and PTP\u00a5\u00e1, the dual specificity phosphatases VHR, and Cdc14, and the low molecular weight PTP, were measured. As shown in Table 2, compound 9 exhibits at least several fold selectivity for SHP2 over all PTPs examined. Most importantly, compound 9 displays excellent cellular activity as shown below. Cellular Activity of Compound 9. Our ultimate goal is to develop potent and specific SHP2 inhibitors as anti-cancer and anti-leukemia agents. Given the excellent potency and selectivity of 9 toward SHP2, we proceeded to evaluate its ability to inhibit SHP2-dependent signaling inside the cell. Previous studies have demonstrated that SHP2 promotes growth factor-stimulated ERK1/2 activation and cell proliferation. 6 , 7 We have initially used human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, as these cells are relatively easy to culture and express high levels of the EGF receptor, a pathway in which SHP2 is known to positively participate in. 40 , 41 Briefly, HEK293 cells were serum-deprived for 16 hours followed by incubation with vehicle or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM compound 9 for 3 hours. Cells were then stimulated with EGF at 2 ng/mL for 5 to 60 min, total cellular lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and levels of phospho-ERK1/2 were examined. As shown in Figure 4A, 9 strongly inhibits the sustained phase of ERK1/2 activation (60 min post EGF stimulation) that has been shown to depend on SHP2, 42 but not the initial transient phase (5-15 min), which is SHP2-independent and mediated by recruitment of growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2) and the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Son of Sevenless (Sos). 43 Similar results were also obtained in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). To investigate whether this inhibitory effect of 9 on SHP2-mediated signaling is dose-dependent, we pre-treated HEK293 cells with 0 to 20 \u00a5\u00ecM IIB08, followed by EGF stimulation for 60 min. Indeed, a concentration-dependent inhibition of the EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation by 9 was observed (Figure 4B). To ensure that the cellular activity displayed by 9 is not due to nonspecific effects, we also evaluated a structurally related but inactive II-B05 (compound 14), which has an IC 50 value of 86 \u00a5\u00ecM for SHP2 (Table 4). As expected, compound 14 at 20 \u00a5\u00ecM elicits no appreciable change in pERK1/2 level when normalized by total ERK1/2 protein level (Figure 4B). The observation that 9 inhibits SHP2 in intact cells with similar potency as that toward isolated enzyme is remarkable, since previous PTP inhibitors have shown 100-10,000 fold loss of potency from biochemical to cellular assays. Together the data demonstrate that 9 is cell permeable and can effectively inhibit a major pathway positively regulated by SHP2. As we observed inhibition of EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in HEK293 cells, we next investigated whether 9 could inhibit gain-of-function SHP2 mutant-induced hematopoietic progenitor hyperproliferation in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitors from JMML patients are hypersensitive to the cytokine GM-CSF. 44 Studies from our lab have demonstrated that somatic gain-of-function SHP2 mutations E76K, D61V, and D61Y induce hematopoietic progenitor hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. 45 Based on these findings, we predicted that hematopoietic progenitors expressing gain-of-function SHP2 mutants would display reduced proliferation in response to GM-CSF when treated with 9. We compared the effect of 10 \u00a5\u00ecM compound 9 on GM-CSF-stimulated hypersensitivity of wild-type SHP2, SHP2/E76K-, and SHP2/D61Y-expressing hematopoietic progenitors using 3H-thymidine incorporation assays in response to increasing concentrations of GM-CSF. As previously found, expression of SHP2/E76K and SHP2/D61Y induced GM-CSF-stimulated hyperproliferation compared to cells expressing wild-type SHP2 (Figure 5A and 5B). In the presence of 10 \u00a5\u00ecM compound 9, the hyperproliferation of mutant SHP2-expressing progenitors in response to GM-CSF was substantially reduced, to levels similar to that observed with wild-type SHP2-expressing progenitors (Figure 5A and 5B). These studies demonstrate that 9 is effective at significantly reducing GM-CSF-stimulated hyperproliferation induced by activating SHP2 mutations. Collectively, the results described above indicate that 9 is highly efficacious in cell-based assays and capable of blocking SHP2 activity inside the cell. Molecular Basis of SHP2 Inhibition by Compound 9. To provide insight into the molecular basis for SHP2 inhibition by 9 and to aid the design of SHP2 inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity, we determined the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of SHP2 (residues 262-528) in complex with 9. The SHP2?9 complex crystallized in space group P2 1 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The crystals of the SHP2?9 complex diffracted to 2.0 A resolution and the structure was solved by molecular replacement, using the apo-form of SHP2 catalytic domain (PDB accession 3B7O) 46 as the search model. The three-dimensional structure of SHP2?9 was refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 19.1% (R free 25.1%), and the statistics for the data collection and refinement are shown in Table 3. The atomic model includes SHP2 residues 262-312, 324-527, and all atoms of the inhibitor (Figure 6). Unambiguous electron densities are observed for all surface loops, including the PTP signature motif or the P-loop (residues 458-465, which harbors the active site nucleophile C459 and R465 for recognition of the phosphoryl moiety in the substrate), the pTyr recognition loop (residues 277-284, which confers specificity to pTyr), the WPD loop (residues 421-431, which contains the general acid-base catalyst D425), and the Q-loop (residues 501-507, which contains the conserved Q506 required to position and activate a water molecule for hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate). 47 The overall structure of SHP2?9 is similar to the ligand-free SHP2 structure used for molecular replacement, with the root-mean-square-derivation (RMSD) for all \u00a5\u00e1-carbon positions between the two being 0.5 A. The major difference between the two structures is electron density in SHP2 active site corresponding to 9, which was confirmed by analyzing the |F o| - |F c| difference map contoured at 3.0 \u00a5\u00f2 (Figure 6B). This represents the first three-dimensional structure of SHP2 in complex with a small molecule ligand. As expected, the salicylic acid moiety of 9 is found in the SHP2 active-site pocket and forms extensive interactions with residues in the P-loop, the pTyr recognition loop, and the WPD loop (Figure 7). Specifically, the phenolic oxygen atom O 1 within the salicylic acid core makes a hydrogen bond with the main chain amide of R465 in the P-loop; the carboxylate O 2 forms two polar interactions with the side chains of R465 and Q510; and O 3 contributes two H-bonds with the side-chains of R465 and W423 respectively. Additional, the salicylic acid moiety also engages in five more polar interactions with SHP2, mediated by two water molecules (W1 and W2) in the active site (Figure 7). Thus, O 3 also participates in a W2-mediated H-bond network with the backbone carbonyls of P424, D425, and G427 in the WPD loop whereas O 1 is hydrogen-bonded to W1, which makes a H-bond with the main chain amide of S460 in the P-loop and a polar interaction with the side chain of K366. In addition to these polar interactions, there are also Van der Walls contacts between SHP2 and the salicylic acid core portion of 9. For example, the indole ring of 9 interacts with the side chains of S460 and R465; the methyl group immediately attached to the indole ring has hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of Y279 and A461. Although the salicylic acid core occupies the active site, the manner by which it interacts with SHP2 differs significantly from those observed between pTyr and PTP1B (Figure 8). Binding of pTyr or nonhydrolyzable pTyr mimetics to the PTPs usually accompanies the closure of the flexible WPD loop, 27 , 48 , 49 which harbors the catalytically essential general acid/base D425. 52 A strong stacking interaction between R465 in the P-loop and W423 of the WPD loop is found in the pTyr-bound PTP structures, which plays an important role in stabilizing the closed conformation. Interestingly, the WPD loop in SHP2 adopts an open conformation when 9 is bound. Compared to pTyr in PTP1B, the salicylic acid core moves \u00a1\u00ad3.5 A toward the WPD loop (Figure 8). As a result, the carboxylate of the salicylic acid core makes direct polar contacts with the guanidinium group of R465 and the side chain of W423, precluding a favorable interaction between R465 and W423 to enable WPD loop closure. In addition, the W2-mediated interactions between O 3 and the backbone carbonyls of P424, D425, and G427 further prevent WPD loop closure. Molecular modeling suggests that substrate pNPP can still be accommodated by SHP2's active site in the presence of 9. Since the WPD loop open conformation is catalytically incompetent, our structural observation that 9 binds SHP2 in the WPD loop open conformation is consistent with 9 being a noncompetitive inhibitor. Further inspection of the structure of the SHP2?9 complex revealed that, in addition to the salicylic acid core-dependent interactions, the distal phenyl ring P 4 in the biphenyl diversity element is sandwiched between the side chains of R362 and K364 in the \u00a5\u00e2 5-\u00a5\u00e2 6 loop (residues 362-365) (Figure 7). Interestingly, the \u00a5\u00e2 5-\u00a5\u00e2 6 loop is highly divergent among the PTPs (Figure 9), and has been implicated in substrate recognition by SHP1. 50 These additional non-polar interactions between P 4 and residues R362 and K364 are likely responsible for the enhanced potency and selectivity of 9. To directly show the involvement for these peripheral site interactions in SHP2 binding, we prepared and analyzed several compounds structurally related to 9 (Table 4). Consistent with the observed binding mode, 9 binds SHP2 with a 38.5-fold higher affinity than that of the salicylic acid core 1 alone (Table 4). Moreover, when the distal P 4 ring was removed from 9, the IC 50 value for the resulting compound 14 increased 15.6-fold. The importance of the interactions between P 4 and R362/K364 was further manifest by the observation that either a decrease or an increase in the linker size by one methylene unit led to a \u00a1\u00ad2-fold reduction in the IC 50 values for II-A08 (9a) and II-C08 (9b), respectively (Table 4). These results are in excellent agreement with the structural observation, supporting the conclusion that interactions between P 4 and R362/K364 contribute to the enhanced potency of 9 for SHP2. To determine whether the interactions between P 4 and R362/K364 also play a role in controlling compound 9 selectivity, we studied two SHP2 mutants bearing substitutions at residue K364, which corresponds to an Arg in SHP1 and a Ser in PTP1B (Figure 9). Substitutions at K364 are expected to perturb the interactions with the distal end of 9. Kinetic analysis yielded an IC 50 of 9.0 \u00a1\u00be 0.3 \u00a5\u00ecM for SHP2/K364R and of 10.8 \u00a1\u00be 0.2 \u00a5\u00ecM for SHP2/K364S. These IC 50 values are 1.6 and 2.0-fold higher than that of wild-type SHP2, in accord with K364 playing a contributing role to compound 9 selectivity. They are also slightly lower than those determined for SHP1 and PTP1B, indicating that additional variable residues in SHP2 may also be involved in controlling compound 9 selectivity. Collectively, the structure and activity data plus results from mutational experiments are consistent with the structural observation that 9 achieves its potency and specificity by directly targeting regions that are structurally divergent in PTPs. In summary, we describe here a salicylic acid-based combinatorial library approach designed to target both the PTP active site and a unique nearby sub-pocket for enhanced affinity and selectivity. High throughput screening of the library led to the identification of a SHP2 inhibitor 9 with promising potency and selectivity. More importantly, 9 possesses highly efficacious cellular activity and is capable of blocking growth factor stimulated ERK1/2 activation as well as blocking SHP2 gain-of-function mutant-induced hematopoietic progenitor hyperproliferation in response to GM-CSF. The results suggest that the bicyclic salicylic acid pharmacophore chemistry platform may provide a potential solution to overcome the bioavailability issue that has plagued the PTP drug discovery field for many years. X-ray crystallographic analysis of compound 9-bound SHP2 structure reveals that the salicylic acid core occupies the PTP active site, while the distal biphenyl ring makes hydrophobic contacts with a region highly divergent among the PTPs. The atomic-level information on SHP2?9 together with studies of compound 9 derivatives and SHP2 mutants furnish a solid foundation for the design of more potent and selective SHP2-based small molecule therapeutics. Given the ease and versatility of the click chemistry based library construction methodology described in this report, it is expected that cell permeable, salicylic acid-based small molecule inhibitors will become available for other PTPs as well.

HRMS (ESI): mass calculated for C 34H 30N 5O 4 [M + H] +, 572.2298, found [M + H] +, 572.2274. SHP2 cloning, expression and purification. A PCR-based strategy was used to amplify the sequence coding for the catalytic domain of SHP2 (residues 262-528) from the full length construct. The PCR products were gel purified, digested with Nde I and Xho I restriction enzymes (Invitrogen) and ligated to the linearized pET-21a(+) vector (Novagen). The ligation products were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) plys competent cells (Novagen). Gene sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing carried out by the DNA Sequencing Facility at Indiana University School of Medicine. For protein expression, transformed E. coli cells were grown at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C in Luria broth (LB) containing 100 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL ampicillin for 4 h to an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm, and then induced for protein production with 0.4 mM IPTG overnight at 20 \u00a1\u00c6C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6500 rpm for 15 min at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C), and the cell pellets from 1 L LB medium were suspended in 30 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 5 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.05 mg/mL trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1 mM PMSF. The suspensions were passed twice through a French Press at 1200 psi, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C for 45 min at 16,000 rpm. The supernatants were mixed with 2 ml Ni-NTA Agarose (His*Bind Resin) (Qiagen) at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C for 50 min, washed by 200 mL binding buffer (5 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)), followed by 20 mL washing buffer (20 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)), and then eluted with 20 mL elution buffer (200 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)). The elute was dialyzed for 6 h at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C against 1 L buffer A (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM MES (pH 6.0), 1 mM EDTA), and then loaded onto a Mono S column equilibrated at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C with buffer A. The column was washed with 10 mL buffer A and then eluted with a 40 mL linear gradient of 0 to 1 M NaCl in buffer A. SHP2 was eluted at 0.35 M NaCl. The column fractions were analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and by carrying out SDS-PAGE analysis. The fractions were combined, dialyzed against 1 L buffer A and concentrated at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C to 7 mg/mL using an Amicon concentrator and then stored at -80 \u00a1\u00c6C. The SHP2 protein was shown to be homogeneous by SDS-PAGE analysis. Kinetic analysis of SHP2 inhibition by the salicylic acid-based library. The phosphatase activity of SHP2 was assayed using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as a substrate at 25\u00a1\u00c6C in 50 mM 3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mM EDTA with an ionic strength of 0.15 M adjusted by NaCl. The salicylic acid based library was screened in a 96-well format at 10 \u00a5\u00ecM compound concentration. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 \u00a5\u00ecl of the enzyme to 195 \u00a5\u00ecl of reaction mixture containing 10 \u00a5\u00ecM test compound and various concentrations of pNPP, and quenched after 5 min by the addition of 50 \u00a5\u00ecl of 5N NaOH. The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of pNPP was corrected by measuring the control without the addition of enzyme. The amount of product p-nitrophenol was determined from the absorbance at 405 nm detected by a Spectra MAX340 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) using a molar extinction coefficient of 18,000 M -1cm -1. Compounds exhibiting more than 50% of inhibitory activity against SHP2 were selected for IC 50 measurement. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 \u00a5\u00ecl of the enzyme to 195 \u00a5\u00ecl of reaction mixture containing 2.9 mM (the K m value) of pNPP and various concentrations of the inhibitor. The reaction was quenched after 5 min by the addition of 50 \u00a5\u00ecl of 5N NaOH, and then 200 \u00a5\u00ecl of reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well plate. The absorbance at 405 nm was detected by a Spectra MAX340 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). IC 50 values were calculated by fitting the absorbance at 405 nm versus inhibitor concentration to the following equation: where A I is the absorbance at 405 nm of the sample in the presence of inhibitor; A 0 is the absorbance at 405 nm in the absence of inhibitor; and [I] is the concentration of the inhibitor. For selectivity studies, the PTPs, including PTP1B, SHP1, FAP1, Lyp, HePTP, VHR, LMWPTP, Cdc14, LAR, PTP\u00a5\u00e1, and CD45 were expressed and purified from E. coli. The inhibition assay for these PTPs were performed under the same conditions as SHP2 except using a different pNPP concentration corresponding to the K m of the PTP studied. Inhibitor concentrations used for IC 50 measurements cover the range from 0.2 to 5\u00a1\u00bf of the IC 50 value. To evaluate potential nonspecific promiscuous inhibition, we first determine whether the compound displays time-dependence inhibition by measuring the IC 50 values with and without enzyme preincubation with the inhibitor. We also determine the effect of bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) on IC 50 values. Finally, we also assess whether the IC 50 values can be influenced by the presence of detergents such as 0.1% of Triton X-100. A well-behaved classical and reversible active site directed inhibitor should not exhibit any dependence on time, BSA, and detergents. K i Measurement. The SHP2-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP in the presence of 9 was assayed at 25 \u00a1\u00c6C and in the assay buffer described above. The mode of inhibition and K i value were determined in the following manner. At various fixed concentrations of inhibitor (0-3 K i), the initial rate at a series of pNPP concentrations was measured by following the production of p-nitrophenol as describe above, ranging from 0.2- to 5-fold the apparent K m values. The data were fitted to appropriate equations using SigmaPlot-Enzyme Kinetics to obtain the inhibition constant and to assess the mode of inhibition. Retroviral Vectors and Retroviral Transduction. The wild-type SHP2 cDNA was mutated at nucleotides 226 (G>A) or 181 (G>T) using QuikChange\u00a2\u00e2 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to yield amino acid changes E76K or D61Y, respectively. 45 Each cDNA was subcloned into the murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-based bicistronic retroviral vector, pMIEG3, in tandem with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Ecotropic retroviral supernatants (pMIEG3-Wild-Type SHP2, pMIEG3-SHP2/E76K, and pMIEG3-SHP2/D61Y) were prepared using Eco-Phoenix packaging cells. Bone marrow low density mononuclear cells from C57Bl/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were purified using a Ficoll gradient. Cells were pre-stimulated at a concentration of 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells/mL in IMDM, 20% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mM glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and thrombopoietin (Tpo) all at 100 ng/mL (growth factors from Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 24 hours. Cells were then transferred to retroviral supernatant on plates coated with fibronectin fragments (Retronectin, Takara, Madison, WI) with SCF, G-CSF, and Tpo 100 ng/mL for an additional 48 hours. Transduced cells were collected using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for EGFP positive cells. 3H-Thymidine Incorporation. Proliferation was assessed by conducting thymidine incorporation assays on EGFP-sorted Wild-Type SHP2-, SHP2/D61Y-, or SHP2/E76K-expressing hematopoietic progenitors. Briefly, cells were washed and starved in 0.2% BSA with or without any growth factors for 4 hours. 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 cells were cultured in 96-well plates in various concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the absence or presence of 9. Cells were cultured for 16 h and subsequently pulsed with 1.0 \u00a5\u00ecCi of [ 3H] thymidine for 6 to 8 hours. Cells were harvested using an automated 96-well cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) and thymidine incorporation was determined as counts per minute (CPM). Cell Culture and Immunoblot Analysis. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum. 4\u00a1\u00bf10 5 cells were plated into each well of 12-well plates and cultured for 24 h. For biochemical studies, cells were serum-deprived for 16 h followed by treatment with vehicle, compound 9, or 14 for 3 hours. The cells were then stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF, 2 ng/mL) for indicated time followed by preparation of total cell protein lysates. Lysates (30 \u00a5\u00ecg) were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Crystallization of SHP2 with 9 and X-ray Data Collection. All crystallization experiments were carried out at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. For co-crystallization, 100 \u00a5\u00ecL of SHP2 stock (7.0 mg/mL) in 20 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 3.0 mM DTT was mixed with 1 \u00a5\u00ecL of compound 9 stock solution (50 mM in DMSO). Crystals of SHP2?9 complex were obtained at room temperature by vapor diffusion in hanging drops. Protein drops were equilibrated against a reservoir solution containing 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mM magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, and 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.7). The space group of the crystals is P2 1 (Table 3). For X-ray data collection, the crystals were transferred into 5 \u00a5\u00ecL of cryoprotectant buffer containing 30% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mM NaCl, and 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.7), and were allowed to soak for 30 min. The crystals were then flash-cooled by liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected at 23 ID beamline at APS (Argonne, IL). Data were processed using the program HKL2000, 51 and the statistics are provided in Table 3. Structural Determination and Refinement. The structure of SHP2?9 was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe. 52 The structure of SHP2 (PDB entry code 3B7O), 46 without the solvent molecules and the first 16 residues, was used as a search model. The resulting difference Fourier map indicated some alternative tracing, which was incorporated into the model. The map revealed the density for the bound 9 in the active site of SHP2. The structure was refined to 2.0 A resolution with the program CNS, 53 first using simulated annealing at 2,500 K, and then alternating positional and individual temperature factor refinement cycles. The progress of the refinement was evaluated by the improvement in the quality of the electron density maps, and the reduced values of the conventional R factor (R = \u00a5\u00d2 h?F o| - |F c?/\u00a5\u00d2 h|F o|), and the free R factor (3.8% of the reflections omitted from the refinement). 54 Electron density maps were inspected and the model was modified on an interactive graphics workstation with the program O. 55 Finally, water molecules were added gradually as the refinement progressed. They were assigned in the |F o| - |F c| difference Fourier maps with a 3\u00a5\u00f2 cutoff level for inclusion in the model. Supplementary Material. 1_si_001. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Efficacy of the JAK2 inhibitor INCB16562 in a murine model of MPLW515L-induced thrombocytosis and myelofibrosis\tThe discovery of JAK2 and MPL mutations in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) provided important insight into the genetic basis of these disorders and led to the development of JAK2 kinase inhibitors for MPN therapy. Although recent studies have shown that JAK2 kinase inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in a JAK2V617F murine bone marrow transplantation model, the effects of JAK2 inhibitors on MPLW515L-mediated myeloproliferation have not been investigated. In this report, we describe the in vitro and in vivo effects of INCB16562, a small-molecule JAK2 inhibitor. INCB16562 inhibited proliferation and signaling in cell lines transformed by JAK2 and MPL mutations. Compared with vehicle treatment, INCB16562 treatment improved survival, normalized white blood cell counts and platelet counts, and markedly reduced extramedullary hematopoeisis and bone marrow fibrosis. We observed inhibition of STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in vivo consistent with potent inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling. These data suggest JAK2 inhibitor therapy may be of value in the treatment of JAK2V617F-negative MPNs. However, we did not observe a decrease in the size of the malignant clone in the bone marrow of treated mice at the end of therapy, which suggests that JAK2 inhibitor therapy, by itself, was not curative in this MPN model. Introduction. Polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are classified as BCR-ABL ? myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), typified by clonal proliferation of 1 or more myeloid lineages. 1,2 There are approximately 130000 to 150000 patients with MPN in the United States, which makes these disorders among the most common hematopoietic malignancies. 3 Patients with MPN are at high risk for several disease-related complications, including bleeding, thrombosis, splenomegaly, progressive bone marrow failure, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Current therapies for PV and ET are largely empiric, and include antiplatelet therapy, phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, anagrelide, and IFN-\u00a5\u00e3. 4 For patients with PMF or with post-PV/ET myelofibrosis, treatment options are limited, with the notable exception of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for the subset of patients in which age and/or comorbidities do not exclude transplantation as a therapeutic option. 5,6 There is therefore a need for novel therapies for patients with these disorders. Although previous studies had demonstrated the clonal stem cell origin of these disorders, 7,8 the genetic basis of these disorders was not known until several groups reported the identification of a recurrent somatic mutation in JAK2 (JAK2V617F) in approximately 90% to 95% of patients with PV and in approximately 50% to 60% of patients with ET and PMF. 9?14 Expression of JAK2V617F in vitro transforms hematopoietic cells to cytokine-independent growth and leads to constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways. 9,15 In addition, expression of JAK2V617F in vivo using the murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) assay results in a short latency, fully penetrant MPN notable for marked polycythemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and variable progression to myelofibrosis. 16?19 These data demonstrate the importance of JAK2V617F to the pathogenesis of JAK2V617F-positive MPN. Although the discovery of JAK2V617F mutations in almost all patients with PV and approximately half of those with ET and PMF provided important insight into the molecular basis of these MPNs, the etiology of JAK2V617F ? MPN remained unknown. Investigators subsequently identified somatic activating mutations in exon 12 of JAK2 in patients with JAK2V617F ? PV; 20 however, alternate JAK2 mutations were not identified in JAK2V617F ? ET and PMF. Based on the observation that the JAK2V617F kinase requires expression of a type I homodimeric cytokine receptor (EPOR, MPL, GCSFR) to efficiently transform hematopoietic cells, 15 investigators sequenced these cytokine receptors in patients with MPN and identified somatic mutations at codon 515 of the thrombopoietin receptor (MPLW515L) in ET and PMF. 21 Subsequent to the initial identification of the MPLW515L allele, additional somatic mutations at codon 515 (MPLW515K, MPLW515A) 22,23 and at codon 505 (MPLS505N) 24 have been identified in patients with ET/PMF. Analysis of large patient cohorts suggests that somatic MPL mutations are present in approximately 3% of patients with ET and 8% of patients with PMF. 24,25 Expression of MPLW515L transforms murine and human hematopoietic cell lines to cytokine-independent growth, and results in constitutive activation of several downstream molecules, including STAT3, STAT5, ERK, and PI3K/Akt pathways. 21 More importantly, overexpression of MPLW515L in the murine BMT assay results in development of an acute myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by features of human ET and PMF, including marked thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and the rapid development of extramedullary hematopoeisis and reticulin fibrosis in all mice expressing this mutant allele. 21 Based on the identification of activating JAK2 and MPL mutations in these MPNs, many groups have initiated efforts aimed at developing small-molecule inhibitors of JAK2 signaling for the treatment of MPN. 26 These compounds inhibit growth and signaling in cell lines transformed by JAK2V617F and MPLW515L 27 and in primary MPN patient samples, 28 and have demonstrated efficacy in a murine BMT model of JAK2V617F-induced PV. 29 Based on these data, different JAK2 inhibitors have entered early-stage clinical trials for patients with PMF and post-PV/ET PMF, 30 and at this early stage it is difficult to ascertain whether JAK2 inhibition will lead to significant hematologic and molecular responses in the different MPNs, and if responses will differ based on mutational context. Given that previous in vivo studies have focused on the effects of JAK2 inhibition in a JAK2V617F-dependent model of PV, we sought to ascertain whether JAK2 inhibition would improve thrombocytosis, myelofibrosis, and survival in a MPLW515L-dependent model of ET/PMF. Methods. Reagents. INCB16562 was synthesized by Incyte Corporation. A total of 1mM stock solutions were prepared and stored in DMSO and diluted in RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) just before use. Antibodies used for Western blotting included phosphorylated and total JAK2, STAT3, STAT5, and MAPK (Cell Signaling), and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Luminex assay kits (mouse cytokine 32-plex) were used to quantify plasma cytokine levels (Millipore). The hMPL wild-type plasmid was generously provided by K. Kaushansky (University of California San Diego) and cloned into the MSCV-IRES-EGFP retroviral vector. The MPLW515L mutation was generated using site-directed mutagenesis (Quickchange-XL; Stratagene) and confirmed by full-length DNA sequencing. The MSCV-mJAK2-GFP, MSCV-mJAK2V617F-GFP and MSCV-mJAK2K539L-GFP plasmids have been previously described. 16,20 Cell lines. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco-modified Eagle medium with 10% FBS. Transient cotransfection of 293T cells and generation of retroviral supernatant were performed using Fugene (Roche) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Ba/F3 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS and 1 ng/mL murine IL-3 (R&D Systems). Ba/F3 cells expressing the murine EPOR (BaF3-EPOR) 31 were grown in RPMI medium with 10% FBS and 1 U/mL EPO. Ba/F3 cells were transduced with viral supernatant containing MSCV-hMPLW515L-GFP, whereas Ba/F3-EPOR cells were transduced with retroviral supernatant containing MSCV-mJAK2-GFP or MSCV-mJAK2V617F-GFP and MSCV-mJAK2 K539L-GFP vectors, respectively, sorted for green fluorescent protein (GFP) positivity by flow cytometry or by growth in the absence of cytokines. The human leukemic cell lines THP-1, NOMO-1, and HEL were cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, whereas SET-2 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 with 20% FBS. UKE-1 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% horse serum and 1\u00a5\u00ecM hydrocortisone. In vitro inhibitor assays and Western blot analysis. A total of 10000 viable cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates in 200 \u00a5\u00ecL of RPMI media with different concentrations of INCB16562 in triplicate. The 48-hour proliferation was assessed using the Cell Viability Luminescent Assay Kit (CellTiter-Glo; Promega). Results were normalized to growth of cells in media containing an equivalent volume of DMSO. The concentration at which 50% inhibition in proliferation occurred was determined using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. For Western blot analysis of signaling pathways, cell lines were exposed to different concentrations of INCB16562 or to DMSO for 4 hours. Cells were then collected and lysed in lysis buffer and separated by electrophoresis as described previously. 32 Nitrocellulose membrane was blocked in TBST/5% milk and incubated with antibodies as described in \u00a1\u00b0Reagents.\u00a1\u00b1 Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described previously. 13 Murine model and analysis of mice. The MPL wild-type and W515L murine BMT assay was performed as described previously. 21 Briefly, bone marrow cells from 5FU-treated male donors were harvested and transduced with viral supernatants containing either MSCV-hMPLW515L-GFP or MSCV-hMPLWT-GFP, and 750000 bone marrow cells of each type were injected into the tail veins of lethally irradiated female BALB/c mice. Nonlethal bleeds were performed 11 days after transplantation to assess disease severity in all mice. MPLW515L mice were then randomized to receive once-daily treatment with INCB16562 (20 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg) or with vehicle by oral gavage beginning 12 days after transplantation. We also observed 5 MPLW515L mice not treated with either vehicle or drug to study the course of the disease. MPL wild-type (MPLWT) mice were randomized to receive either vehicle (n = 5 mice) or INCB16562 (60 mg/kg) per day. With the exception of mice killed at specific time points for flow cytometric analysis, all mice were treated for 28 days or until any one of several criteria for killing were met, including severe lethargy, more than 10% body weight loss, and palpable splenomegaly that extended across the midline in accordance with our Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee?approved animal protocol. Animal care was in strict compliance with institutional guidelines established by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academy of Sciences 1996), 33 and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Differential blood counts were assessed by mandibular bleeds before the trial, after 14 days of therapy/vehicle, and at study endpoints. Cytokine levels in mouse serum were determined using the Luminex multiplex bead-based assay system and the Millipore Mouse Cytokine 32-plex kit on a Luminex 200 following the manufacturer's protocols. Data analysis included with the Luminex 200 was used to conduct a 5-parameter logistic fitting method to determine cytokine concentrations. Bone marrow and spleen samples were subjected to Gordon and Sweeds stain for reticulin fibers (ammoniacal silver procedure). For histopathology, tissues were fixed in formalin and then embedded in paraffin for analysis as previously described. 15 Immunohistochemistry for pSTAT3 was performed as previously described. 34 We performed blinded immunohistochemical analysis of slides from 5 different mice in each group and counted the number of cells with positive-nuclear staining for pSTAT3 at \u00a1\u00bf20 magnification in cohorts of 5 mice treated with vehicle, 60 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg, respectively. Tissue sections were examined with a 2\u00a1\u00bf/0.6, 10\u00a1\u00bf/0.6, 20\u00a1\u00bf/0.6, or 40\u00a1\u00bf/0.6 objective. Photomicrographs were examined using a Zeiss Axio2 imaging microscope. Final images were assembled using a Zeiss Miramax scanner viewer. Flow cytometry. For surface flow cytometry of mouse bone marrow and spleen, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 1% BSA and stained with monoclonal antibodies in PBS plus 1% BSA for 20 minutes on ice. Antibodies used were CD41a (PE), CD11b (PECy7), Gr1 (APCCy7), CD71 (PE), and Ter119 (PECy7; all from BD Pharmingen). Cells were gated for viability after incubation with 7-amino-actinomycin (7AAD) and GFP positivity, and more than 100000 events were analyzed from this subset for marker expression using a FACSCalibur. For phospho-flow analysis, freshly isolated bone marrow from animals that had received transplants of hMPLW515L was harvested and exposed ex vivo to either DMSO or INCB16562 (1\u00a5\u00ecM) at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 2 hours. After this, cells were stimulated with rhGCSF (375 ng/mL; R&D Systems), rhTPO (1250 ng/mL; R&D Systems), or vehicle for 10 minutes. Cells were then fixed immediately with 2% paraformaldehyde (BD Pharmingen) and permeabilized with 90% ice-cold methanol. Briefly, cells were incubated with CD11b (APCCy7) and CD61 (PE) in combination with anti?phospho-STAT3Y705 (Ax647), anti?phospho-STAT3S727 (Ax647), or anti?phospho-STAT5Y694 (Ax647; BD Pharmingen). For progenitor sorts, bone marrow cells and splenocytes were stained with the following antibodies for 20 minutes on ice: CD34 (PE), Fc\u00a5\u00e3R (Pacific Blue), CD117 (APCH7), Sca1 (PECy7), CD127 (biotin), CD4 (biotin), CD5 (biotin), CD8a (biotin), and CD19 (biotin; all from BD Pharmingen). Cells were then washed and restained with streptavidin (PerCP; BD Pharmingen) and propidium iodide. After a final wash, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSAria to enumerate the common myeloid progenitor (CMPs), granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMPs), and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor populations (MEPs) as previously described. 35 The gates for defining various subsets were set in the following manner using (1) unstained controls, (2) \u00a1\u00b0fluorescence-minus one\u00a1\u00b1 (FMO) controls for experiments when more than 2 surface markers were used simultaneously, and (3) by the use of gating on discrete cell populations, when present, and then application of this exact gate to other groups stained with the same fluorophore. Also, all fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) data presented is gated on living cells followed by gating for GFP + cells. All data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). Statistical analyses. Pooled data were displayed as means plus or minus SD. Statistical significance between 2 groups was assessed using the nonparametric exact 1-tailed (Wilcox?Mann-Whitney) test. Results. Effects of INCB16562 on proliferation of hematopoietic cell lines. INCB16562 is an orally bioavailable, selective small-molecule inhibitor of JAK2 with a cell-free half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of approximately 0.3nM. In enzyme assays, INCB16562 shows maximal inhibitory activity against JAK2, followed by JAK1 (2.2nM) and then JAK3 (10nM). Activity of the compound was evaluated in a variety of Ba/F3 isogenic cell lines and human leukemic cell lines (Figure 1; supplemental Figure 1, available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). We first evaluated the ability of INCB16562 to inhibit the proliferation of Ba/F3 isogenic cell lines expressing the Tel-JAK1/2/3 fusion proteins. Ba/F3 cells expressing Tel-JAK2 were most sensitive to INCB16562 with an IC 50 of 168nM, whereas Ba/F3 cell lines expressing Tel-JAK1 (IC 50 = 2310nM) and Tel-JAK3 (IC 50 = 2494nM) were much less sensitive (supplemental Figure 1A). INCB16562 inhibited the proliferation of Ba/F3-EPOR cells expressing JAK2V617F (IC 50 = 177nM) or the exon 12 mutant JAK2K539L (IC 50 = 406nM) and of Ba/F3 cells expressing hMPLW515L (IC 50 = 600nM), but Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL were much less sensitive, with an IC 50 of 2840nM (Figure 1A). Similar results were observed in leukemic cell lines; the JAK2V617F + cell lines SET-2 (IC 50 = 46nM) and UKE-1 (573nM) were sensitive to growth inhibition by INCB16562, whereas the JAK2-wild-type cell lines THP-1 (IC 50 = 3460nM) and NOMO-1 (IC 50 > 3000nM) were much less sensitive (supplemental Figure 1B). Effects of INCB16562 on signal transduction. We investigated the effects of INCB16562 on signal transduction pathways in sensitive and resistant hematopoietic cell lines. Treatment with INCB16562 markedly reduced phosphorylation of JAK2 in Ba/F3-EPOR-JAK2V617F, Ba/F3-EPOR-JAK2K539L, and Ba/F3-MPLW515L cells (Figure 1B). We also observed dose-dependent inhibition of downstream signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5, and MAPK at doses comparable with those required for growth inhibition (250nM-1000nM). In contrast, signaling in Ba/F3-BCR-ABL cells was not affected, with persistent STAT5 and MAPK phosphorylation seen in the presence of 2000nM INCB16562 (Figure 1C). We observed similar results in JAK2V617F + and JAK2V617F ? human leukemia cell lines, with potent inhibition of downstream signaling pathways in JAK2V617F + SET-2 and UKE-1 cells but not in JAK2V617F ? NOMO-1 cells (supplemental Figure 1C). INCB16562 improves survival in the MPLW515L model of ET/PMF. We have previously shown that expression of MPLW515L using the murine BMT assay induces a rapid and lethal myeloproliferative disease in mice that recapitulates many features of human ET and PMF, including marked thrombocytosis, myelofibrosis, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. 21 Given the in vitro efficacy of INCB16562 in JAK2-dependent cell lines, we assessed the efficacy of INCB16562 in the MPLW515L retroviral model of ET/PMF (supplemental Figure 2). We assessed engraftment and disease severity by measuring blood counts in all mice 11 days after tail vein injection; at this time point, all mice had evidence of myeloproliferation with leukocytosis (110.7 \u00a1\u00be 64.8 K/\u00a5\u00ecL) and thrombocytosis (1595 \u00a1\u00be 556.4 K/\u00a5\u00ecL). Animals were then randomized to begin treatment with vehicle or with 20 mg/kg per day, 60 mg/kg per day, or 120 mg/kg per day of INCB16562 administered by oral gavage beginning on day 12. All mice receiving vehicle died within 21 days of treatment initiation, consistent with previous transplantation experiments with MPLW515L. The survival, body weight, liver/spleen weight, and blood counts of mice treated with or without vehicle were not significantly different (supplemental Figure 3), arguing against an adverse effect of vehicle on disease severity. Although all mice receiving 20 mg/kg per day died soon thereafter, all mice randomized to receive 60 mg/day or 120 mg/kg per day were alive on day 28 of drug therapy (P < .001; Figure 2A). We noted a rapid decline in the weight of mice treated with vehicle (or untreated W515L mice), whereas mice receiving 60 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg INCB16562 regained weight lost after transplantation and maintained their weight throughout the rest of the trial. This difference in weights was statistically significant starting at 17 days of treatment with 120 mg/kg per day (P = .007) and after 18 days of treatment with 60 mg/kg per day (P = .004; Figure 2B). This observation is consistent with the improvement in body weight and constitutional symptoms of patients with PMF who have received JAK2 inhibitors in early clinical trials. 36 INCB16562 improves thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and extramedullary hematopoeisis in MPLW515L model. To assess the effects of INCB16562 on MPLW515L-induced thrombocytosis and leukocytosis, we performed peripheral blood analyses of all mice on the day that they were randomized to receive treatment (day 0), 14 days after treatment initiation (day 14), and at the end of treatment (day 28). Mice receiving INCB16562 had a dose-dependent reduction in leukocytosis and thrombocytosis over time (Figure 2C). Specifically, mice receiving INCB16562 60 mg/kg per day had a 50% reduction in white blood cell (WBC) counts compared with their counts before therapy, and their platelet counts were unchanged, whereas platelet counts in vehicle-treated mice increased by more than 100% by day 14 of the trial. Mice receiving INCB16562 120 mg/kg per day had a 98% reduction in WBC counts compared with before therapy, and their platelet counts were normalized by day 14 of drug therapy. By day 28, platelet counts in mice treated with 60 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg INCB16562 increased compared with levels at 14 days after treatment, but still remained within normal limits (Figure 2C). In contrast, drug treatment of mice who received transplants of MPLWT cells did not result in any difference in weights (supplemental Figure 4A), blood counts (supplemental Figure 4B), or in liver/spleen weights (supplemental Figure 4C) at time of death. These data demonstrate that expression of MPLW515L, but not MPLWT, results in marked leukocytosis and thrombocytosis that is reversed by JAK2 inhibitor therapy. Planned killing of a subset of mice 12 days after treatment initiation allowed us to assess the effects of INCB16562 on extramedullary hematopoeisis and on histology in target organs. We observed a dose-dependent decrease in spleen and liver weights of W515L mice receiving 60 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg INCB16562 compared with vehicle-treated mice (P < .001; Figure 2D). Histologic evaluation of bone marrow revealed a decrease in overall cellularity compared with vehicle-treated mice (Figure 3A). In addition to the reduction in spleen size (Figure 2D), INCB16562 therapy was associated with partial normalization of splenic histology and periarteriolar lymphatic sheaths, whereas vehicle-treated mice showed neutrophilic infiltration of the spleen with complete effacement of normal splenic architecture (Figure 3B). There was a dose-dependent decrease in the number of megakaryocytes in treated mice versus vehicle (P < .01; Figure 3F). We also noted marked infiltration of neutrophils in the livers of vehicle-treated mice which greatly distorted the normal hepatic architecture; in contrast, hepatic histology was preserved in mice receiving 60 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg INCB16562 (Figure 3C). Histopathologic analysis of lung tissue revealed neutrophilic and megarkyocytic extramedullary infiltrates in the lungs of vehicle control but not INCB16562-treated mice (data not shown). Mice that received transplants of MPLWT-transduced cells, regardless of their assigned treatment (vehicle or INCB16562) had bone marrow, spleen, and liver histopathology similar to that seen in INCB16562-treated MPLW515L mice (Figure 3A-D; first panel). Most importantly, reticulin-staining of bone marrow and spleen from mice treated with 60 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg INCB16562 showed a marked reduction in fibrosis compared with vehicle-treated mice (Figure 3D-E). We also assessed bone marrow fibrosis in MPLW515L mice killed just before treatment initiation (day 11) and found that all MPLW515L mice had at least moderate bone marrow and spleen fibrosis at this early time point. These data suggest that fibrosis in hMPLW515L mice is reduced, and not merely prevented, by INCB16562 treatment (Figure 3D-E; supplemental Figure 5). A minimum of 6 reticulin slides (each from bone marrow and spleen) taken from at least 3 different animals per treatment group was reviewed. In addition to improving body weight and reducing WBC and platelet counts, treatment with INCB16562 produced profound decrements (\u00a1\u00c3 2 log 2) in inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic growth factors, many of which have been associated with the hypercatabolic state and constitutional symptoms observed in patients with MPN, including IL-6, TNF\u00a5\u00e1, interleukin 1\u00a5\u00e2 (IL-1\u00a5\u00e2), and VEGF (Figure 4). 37 Flow cytometric analyses of INCB16562-treated mice versus vehicle control MPLWT and MPLW515L mice. Consistent with histopathologic analyses, we noted a decrease in myeloid cell burden in the spleens and bone marrows of INCB16562-treated MPLW515L mice by surface flow cytometry (supplemental Figure 6). We noted a reduction in the proportion of Gr1/Mac-1 double-positive population in the spleen, but not bone marrow, of drug-treated mice (supplemental Figure 6A), and noted a decrease in the proportion of CD41 + megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and spleen of drug-treated MPLW515L mice (supplemental Figure 6C). We also observed a decrease in the proportion of early erythroid precursors (CD71 single-positive and CD71/Ter119 double-positive cells) in mice treated with 60 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg INCB16562 compared with vehicle-treated mice (supplemental Figure 6B). No differences were seen in the proportion of B-cell populations in mice treated with 60 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg INCB16562 compared with vehicle-treated mice (data not shown). MPLWT mice treated with 60 mg/kg per day INCB16562 did not show any significant differences in the granulocyte, neutrophil, or erythroid populations between vehicle-treated or drug-treated samples either in the bone marrow or spleen (supplemental Figure 7A-C). To further determine whether the decrease in myelopoiesis in bone marrow and spleens of treated MPLW515L mice could be attributed to a decrease at the level of the myeloid precursors, we performed multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of stem and progenitor populations on bone marrow and spleen from MPLW515L mice treated with 60 mg/kg INCB16562 compared with vehicle-treated MPLW515L mice. First, compared with control Balb/C mice and mice transduced with MPLWT bone marrow cells, we noted a marked increase in the proportion of megakaryocyte-erythroid precursor cells (MEPs) in vehicle-treated MPLW515L mice such that they accounted for the majority of progenitor cells in the spleens of diseased mice (supplemental Figure 8A). In contrast, mice treated with 60 mg/kg INCB16562 demonstrated a distribution of cells within the GMP, CMP, and MEP gates in the spleen consistent with normalization of the size of the MEP compartment (supplemental Figure 8A). We consistently observed a significant decrease in the size of the GFP + spleen MEP compartment with INCB16562 treatment of MPLW515L mice: the average proportion of GFP + spleen MEPs in 3 independent experiments was 0.0117 plus or minus 0.009 in drug-treated mice compared with 0.155 plus or minus 0.035 in vehicle-treated mice (P = .04, Mann-Whitney U test; supplemental Figure 8B). In contrast to the marked effects seen in the spleen MEP population, the absolute number of GFP + MEP cells in bone marrow was not statistically significant after 12 days of INCB16562 treatment at 60 mg/kg per day (supplemental Figure 8B). We also assessed the percentage of GFP + cells within the MEP population in bone marrow and spleen of vehicle and treated mice. The average percentage of GFP + MEP cells without treatment was 68.0% with vehicle treatment compared with 31.3% with INCB16562 (P = .043, Mann-Whitney U test). This suggests that although the effects of INCB16562 on the bone marrow MEP population are modest compared with the spleen MEP population, there is a relative decrease in the relative proportion of mutant MEPs in bone marrow and spleen relative to wild-type MEPs. We did not observe significant differences in the bone marrow or splenic MEP population of MPLWT vehicle-treated or MPLWT INCB16562-treated mice (supplemental Figure 9), and stem/progenitor populations of mice that received transplants of MPLWT 12 days after transplantation, regardless of vehicle/drug treatment, were similar to control BALB/c mice. Inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling with INCB16562 treatment in vivo. To investigate the effects of INCB16562 on signal transduction in vivo, we performed Western blotting and phosphoprotein-specific flow cytometry on spleen and bone marrow cells from mice treated with INCB16562 or with vehicle. Western blot analysis demonstrated marked reduction of STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in splenocytes from mice treated with 60 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg INCB16562 compared with mice treated with vehicle or with 20 mg/kg INCB16562 (Figure 5A). We observed a near-complete or complete inhibition of STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in vivo in 3 of 4 60 mg/kg-treated mice and in all 3 120 mg/kg-treated mice; in contrast, we observed persistent, marked STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in all vehicle-treated mice and in mice treated with 20 mg/kg INCB16562. Of note, pMAPK levels did not differ between vehicle-treated and drug-treated mice consistent with persistent activation of the MAPK pathway in vivo in the setting of JAK2 inhibition. We then asked whether INCB16562 treatment of mouse hematopoietic cells inhibited JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 in specific myeloid cell subsets by phospho-flow cytometry. A total of 2 hours of ex vivo INCB16562 treatment resulted in inhibition of phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 in response to stimulation by rhGCSF and rhTPO in CD11b + and CD61 + cells (Figure 5B). These results were representative of 3 separate experiments, and we consistently observed a greater effect of INCB16562 on inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation compared with STAT5 phosphorylation in purified megakaryocyte and neutrophil populations. In addition, immunohistochemical staining for pSTAT3Y705 in mice spleen revealed a significant decrease in pSTAT3Y705 with INCB16562 therapy compared with vehicle-treated mice (Figure 5C). Specifically, the average number of pSTAT3-stained positive nuclei was 14.8 plus or minus 5.2 in the vehicle-treated group compared with 4.2 plus or minus 1.5 and 3.8 plus or minus 1.9 in the 60 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg INCB16562-treated groups, respectively (P < .05, Mann-Whitney U test). Twenty-eight days of therapy with INCB16562 does not eradicate MPLW515L-expressing cells. Once-daily therapy with INCB16562 improved survival, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, extramedullary hematopoeisis, and myelofibrosis in MPLW515L mutant mice. We then asked if INCB16562 therapy resulted in a reduction in the relative size of the mutant clone by assessing the GFP percentage of different hematopoietic subsets in drug-treated mice. We did not note a decrease in the proportion of GFP + peripheral neutrophils in drug-treated mice over time (supplemental Figure 10B). Treatment with INCB16562 did not result in a significant decrease in the percentage of GFP + bone marrow lineage-negative, Sca-1 +, c-Kit + (LSK) cells (P = .9). There was a nonsignificant reduction in the proportion of GFP + LSK cells in the spleen with INCB16562 treatment (P = .06, Mann-Whitney U test; supplemental Figure 10A). We have also observed 3 mice after discontinuation of INCB16562 (60 mg/kg) treatment after 28 days of treatment and found that these mice survived an average of 20 days after discontinuation of INCB16562 treatment. These data suggest that once-daily therapy with INCB16562 for 28 days at efficacious doses does not eradicate the mutant clone in this model of ET/PMF. Discussion. Mutations in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway are the most common somatic genetic events in PV, ET, and PMF, and MPL mutations are the most frequent class of disease alleles encountered in patients with MPN after JAK2V617F. 17,18 This has led to the development of small-molecule inhibitors of JAK2 for the treatment of PV, ET, and PMF, and several of these agents are in late preclinical studies or in early-phase clinical trials. The agent with the most extensive clinical experience to date is INCB18424, a selective JAK1/2 inhibitor that is currently in phase 1/2 clinical trials for patients with PMF or with post-PV or ET MF. 36 Most patients treated to date have experienced rapid reductions and marked improvements in constitutional symptoms; however, it remains to be seen whether INCB18424 therapy will allow more than the occasional patient to become transfusion independent and whether there will be reductions in JAK2V617F allele burden over time. Based on preclinical data in JAK2V617F + patient samples and preclinical models, several other JAK kinase inhibitors are currently being evaluated in phase 1/2 studies for patients with MPN. 28,29 However, there remain several important questions regarding the use of JAK kinase inhibitors in patients with MPN: (1) Do the existing JAK2 inhibitors completely abrogate JAK2 kinase activity and downstream signaling at clinically achievable doses? (2) Do different JAK inhibitors have similar efficacy/side effects, or will differences in selectivity or pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics alter activity of different compounds? (3) Will JAK inhibitors demonstrate efficacy regardless of JAK2/MPL mutational status? and (4) Will these agents offer more significant benefit to patients with PV and ET compared with patients with PMF or with post-PV or ET MF? In this report, we evaluate the effects of INCB16562, a selective, small-molecule JAK2 kinase inhibitor, on a mouse model of MPLW515L-induced thrombocytosis and myelofibrosis. Both INCB16562 and INCB18424, the clinical compound used in PMF patient trials, inhibit JAK2 most potently, followed by JAK1 (INCB16562 is 5-fold less potent against JAK1 compared with JAK2 in enzyme-based assays versus 2-fold for INCB18424), TYK2 (14-fold less potent versus 7-fold for INCB18424), and then JAK3 (30-fold less potent versus 150-fold for INCB18424). We believe therefore that the observations made regarding the effects of JAK2 inhibition with INCB16562 in our in vitro and in vivo studies are relevant to clinical experiences with INCB18424 (and Li and colleagues 38) and with other JAK2 inhibitors (TG101348, CEP701). 28,29 We demonstrate that treatment once daily with doses of INCB16562 that inhibit JAK-STAT signaling in vivo, markedly improve survival in the MPLW515L murine model. Moreover, we found that INCB16562 therapy resulted in dose-dependent improvement in leukocytosis and thrombocytosis with normalization of WBC counts and platelet counts in all mice treated with 60 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg once daily. We also observed marked improvements in extramedullary hematopoeisis, including reductions in liver and spleen size and marked improvement in liver and spleen architecture. Treatment with INCB16562 also resulted in normalization of multiple inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors elevated in MPLW515L-mutant control mice and in patients with MPN. Mice receiving INCB16562 gained weight consistent with what has been observed in the initial clinical trials with INCB18424 in patients with PMF. We also noted a significant effect of INCB16562 therapy on the proliferation of specific myeloid progenitor populations, including normalization of the size of the MEP compartment in spleens of INBC16562-treated mice. Most importantly, INCB16562 therapy led to significant, dose-dependent reduction of reticulin fibrosis in bone marrow and spleen of all mice treated with doses of INCB16562 that inhibited signaling in vivo. We were able to demonstrate that INCB16562 specifically abrogated JAK-STAT signaling induced by constitutively activated JAK2 and MPL alleles. In vitro studies demonstrated that INCB16562 inhibited proliferation, JAK2 phosphorylation, and downstream signaling pathways in cell lines transformed by JAK2/MPL mutations, but not in hematopoietic cell lines without activating JAK2/MPL alleles. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate potent, dose-dependent inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling in vivo, including potent inhibition of STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in primary tissues from MPLW515L mice treated with INCB16562. The observation that INCB16562 potently inhibits JAK2 activity and downstream signaling in vitro and in vivo provides important insights into the effects of potent JAK2 inhibition in a model of MPN based on a human disease allele. Moreover, we did not see significant benefit on blood counts, histopathology, and survival until we used INCB16562 doses sufficient to inhibit JAK-STAT signaling in vivo, suggesting more attention should be paid to the degree of target inhibition achieved with JAK2 inhibitors in the clinic, potentially using flow cytometric analysis of phosphorylated signaling intermediates to assess pathway inhibition in specific myeloid cell subsets. Although INCB16562 improved survival and reduces myeloproliferation in the MPLW515L murine BMT model, we did not observe a reduction in the proportion of GFP + cells in peripheral blood or in the LSK population with 28 days of treatment. Furthermore, all previously treated mice developed fatal thrombocytosis/leukocytosis within 2 to 3 weeks after cessation of therapy. These data demonstrate INCB16562 does not fully eradicate the MPN clone in our murine model despite in vivo evidence of pathway inhibition and improvements in clinical signs of disease. This may in part reflect the acute nature of the myeloproliferation induced by MPLW515L in the retroviral BMT assay, compared with the chronic myeloproliferation seen in human ET/PMF. However, our experience with INCB16562 in vivo parallels the observations seen thus far in the initial clinical trials of JAK2 inhibitors, where there has been improvement in hematologic parameters and organomegaly with JAK2 inhibition but minimal decrease in allele burden with JAK2 inhibitor therapy. This may reflect the relatively short duration of therapy, insufficient pathway inhibition, insensitivity of the stem cell compartment to targeted therapies, or the possible emergence of resistant/persistent clones over time due to JAK2-dependent or -independent mechanisms. The preclinical and clinical experience with these compounds suggest that treatment with JAK2 inhibitors alone may not be truly curative for these MPNs, and preclinical studies combining JAK2 inhibitors with other existing and novel therapeutic approaches are warranted. Of note, we did not observe in vivo inhibition of MAPK signaling with INCB16562 therapy, and future studies into the basis for persistent in vivo MAPK activation in the setting of JAK2 inhibition and into the potential efficacy of combined JAK2/MAPK inhibition are warranted in MPN models and in MPN patient samples. Taken together, our data show that JAK2 inhibitor therapy offers significant efficacy and limited toxicity in a MPL-mutant model of ET/PMF, and suggest that JAK2 inhibitors may offer significant clinical benefit to patients with JAK2V617F ? ET/PMF, particularly those with MPL mutations. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Differential sensitivity of melanoma cell lines with BRAF V600E mutation to the specific Raf inhibitor PLX4032\tBlocking oncogenic signaling induced by the BRAF V600E mutation is a promising approach for melanoma treatment. We tested the anti-tumor effects of a specific inhibitor of Raf protein kinases, PLX4032/RG7204, in melanoma cell lines. PLX4032 decreased signaling through the MAPK pathway only in cell lines with the BRAF V600E mutation. Seven out of 10 BRAF V600E mutant cell lines displayed sensitivity based on cell viability assays and three were resistant at concentrations up to 10 \u00a5\u00ecM. Among the sensitive cell lines, four were highly sensitive with IC 50 values below 1 \u00a5\u00ecM, and three were moderately sensitive with IC 50 values between 1 and 10 \u00a5\u00ecM. There was evidence of MAPK pathway inhibition and cell cycle arrest in both sensitive and resistant cell lines. Genomic analysis by sequencing, genotyping of close to 400 oncogeninc mutations by mass spectrometry, and SNP arrays demonstrated no major differences in BRAF locus amplification or in other oncogenic events between sensitive and resistant cell lines. However, metabolic tracer uptake studies demonstrated that sensitive cell lines had a more profound inhibition of FDG uptake upon exposure to PLX4032 than resistant cell lines. In conclusion, BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell lines displayed a range of sensitivities to PLX4032 and metabolic imaging using PET probes can be used to assess sensitivity. Background. Improved knowledge of the oncogenic events in melanoma indicates that a majority of mutations activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [1,2]. The most frequent mutation in the MAPK pathway is in the BRAF gene, present in 60-70% of malignant melanomas [3]. NRAS mutations occur in approximately 15% of melanomas [1,4,5] and are mutually exclusive with BRAF mutations [6,7]. The majority of mutations in BRAF are accounted for by a single nucleotide transversion from thymidine to adenosine leading to a substitution of valine by glutamic acid at position 600 (termed BRAF V600E) [3,4,8], which leads to a 500-fold increase in activity compared to the wild type protein kinase [8]. PLX4032 (also known as RG7204) was developed as a specific inhibitor of Raf. It is an analogue of the pre-clinically tested PLX4720 [9]. PLX4720 inhibits the mutated B-Raf kinase at 13 nM, while the wild type kinase requires tenfold higher concentration (160 nM) [9], thus predicting high specificity for BRAF V600E mutant cell lines. The basis of this specificity for the mutated kinase is thought to be the preferential inhibition of the active conformation of B-Raf. In addition, its access to a Raf-selective pocket accounts for the selectivity against most other non-Raf kinases, which require concentrations 100 to 1000 times higher for kinase inhibition. The only exception is the breast tumor kinase (BRK), which is inhibited at 130 nM, a one-log difference compared to the V600E mutated B-Raf kinase [9]. In the current studies we analyzed a panel of human melanoma cell lines with defined oncogenic alterations for sensitivity to PLX4032. In addition, with a view to development of a biomarker to indicate response to targeted therapy, we investigated a non-invasive method of imaging resistance versus sensitivity in vivo. We describe that PLX4032 works differentially in melanoma cell lines with BRAF V600E mutations and that the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) can be used in non-invasive PET imaging to distinguish between sensitive and resistant cell lines. Materials and methods. Reagents and cell lines. PLX4032 (also known as RG7204 or RO5185426) was obtained under a materials transfer agreement (MTA) with Plexxikon (Berkeley, CA) and dissolved in DMSO (Fisher Scientific, Morristown, NJ) to a stock concentration of 10 mM. SKMEL28 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD), and the remaining human melanoma cell lines (M series) were established from patient's biopsies under UCLA IRB approval #02-08-067. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine (Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA) containing 10% (unless noted, all percentages represent volume to volume) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA) and 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin (Omega Scientific). All cell lines were mycoplasma free when periodically tested using a Mycoalert assay (Lonza, Rockland, ME). BRAFV 600E mutation analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted using FlexiGene DNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the 200 bp region flanking the mutation site was amplified by PCR using Invitrogen online primer design (Invitrogen, Calsbad, CA) as described [10]. The PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), sequenced (Laragen Inc., Los Angeles, CA) and aligned with the BRAF gene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NT_007914\",\"term_id\":\"224514812\",\"term_text\":\"NT_007914\"}}NT_007914). Oncomap 3 core mass-spectrometric genotyping. Samples were run through OncoMap 3 which interrogates 396 somatic mutations across 33 genes. Whole genome amplified DNA at 5 ng/\u00a5\u00ecl was used as input for multiplex PCR as described previously [11]. Single-basepair primer extension (iPLEX) was performed in a 2 \u00a5\u00ecl reaction volume using iPLEX Gold single base extension enzyme (Sequenom, San Diego, CA). Products were resined and transferred to SpectroCHIPs for analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry [11]. All mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing of the relevant gene fragment. SNP array analysis. DNA extracted from the full panel of 13 human melanoma cell lines was hybridized onto Illumina Beadchip Human Exon 510S-Duo (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). DNA copy number was calculated using PennCNV (*) as described [12]. Eight of the cell lines (M202, M207, M229, M249, M255, M257, M263, M308) were additionally analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip \u00a2\u00e7 Human Mapping 250K Nsp Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Cell proliferation and viability assays. Melanoma cell lines were treated in triplicates with PLX4032 and parallel vehicle control in the given concentrations for 120 hours. Viable cells was measured using a tetrazolium compound [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS)-based colorimetric cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell line doubling time were determined from cell numbers measured in duplicates every 24 hours for a period of 9 to 12 days using a Vi-CELL series cell viability analyzer (Beckman Coulter). The doubling time in 24 hours was calculated by the formula 1/{[((logC2)-(logC1))\u00a1\u00bf3.32]/T}, where C1 = the initial cell number, C2 = the final cell number, and T = 24 hours. The average of day 3, 4, 5 was used as the optimal doubling time for the given experimental condition. Phosphoflow staining. Cells were plated and treated with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4032 or vehicle control for 1 or 20 hours, fixed in 1.6% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA), permeabilized in 4\u00a1\u00c6C 100% methanol (Fisher Scientific) and stained with Alexafluor 647-conjugated human anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (T202/Y204, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) in sterile PBS (Mediatech Inc.) containing 0.5% albumin bovine serum and 0.01% sodium azide (both from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Flow cytometry was performed on FACSCalibur or FACScan (BD Biosciences) and data was analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star Inc, Asland, OR). Cell cycle analysis. Cells were treated with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4032 and parallel vehicle control for 20 to 120 hours, fixed in 70% ethanol (Pharmco-Aaper, Shelbyville, KY), and then resuspended in sterile PBS containing 0.5% albumin bovine serum, 180 \u00a5\u00ecL/ml propidium iodide staining solution (BD Biosciences) and 50 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL ribonuclease A from bovine pancreas (Sigma-Aldrich). Flow cytometry was performed on FACSCalibur or FACScan and data was analyzed using FlowJo. Apoptosis analysis. Melanoma cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations of PLX4032, DMSO vehicle control, or 1 \u00a5\u00ecM of staurosporine as a positive control, for 120 hours. Cells were trypsinized and transferred to FACS tubes and stained with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide following the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry using FACSCalibur as described [13]. Western Blotting. Western blotting was performed as previously described [14]. Primary antibodies included p-Akt Ser473 and Thr308, Akt, p-S6K, S6K, p-S6 Ser235/236, S6, PTEN, p-ERK Thr204/205, ERK, p-AMPK, AMPK (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and \u00a5\u00e1-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). The immunoreactivity was revealed by use of an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences Co, Piscataway, NJ). In vitro metabolic tracer uptake assay. 10 4 cells/well were plated on 0.001% poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) pre-incubated filter bottom 96-well plates (multiscreen HTS GV 0.22 \u00a5\u00ecm opaque, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and rested for 24 hours. 1 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4032 and parallel vehicle control were added in triplicates for 20 hours. Cells were incubated for 1 hour with 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecCi with one of the three metabolic tracers with analogues used as PET tracers: 2-FDG [5,6- 3H] (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO) in glucose-free DMEM (Invitrogen), or 2'-Deoxy-2'-fluoroarabinofuranosylcytosine-[ 3H], and thymidine [methyl- 3H] (FAC and thymidine, Moravek Biochemicals Inc., Brea, CA) in RPMI 1640. Extracellular metabolic tracer was washed off using a multiscreen HTS vacuum manifold system (Millipore). 100 \u00a5\u00ecL scintillation fluid (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) was added to each well and tritium count was measured on a 1450 microbeta trilux microplate (Perkin Elmer). In vivo microCT and microPET studies. Mice with established subcutaneous human melanoma xenografts were treated for 3 days with 100 mg/kg PLX4032 in corn oil or vehicle control twice daily by oral gavage. The last treatment was given one hour prior to intraperitoneal injection of 200 \u00a5\u00ecCi [ 18F]-FDG, which was allowed to distribute in the tissues for 1 hour before microPET scanning as previously described [15]. Statistical analysis. Continuous variables were compared using a paired Student's t-test with two-tailed P values. Results. PLX4032 specifically blocks the MAPK pathway in melanoma cell lines with the BRAF V600E mutation. We tested the ability of PLX4032 to differentially block MAPK pathway signaling in a panel of human melanoma cell lines (Table ?(Table1)1) by quantitating the inhibition of phosphorylated Erk (pErk), a downstream target of B-Raf activity, using intracellular phosphospecific flow cytometry (Figure ?(Figure1A).1A). As expected, cell lines with BRAF V600E mutation had a fast (detectable at 1 hour) and sustained (persistent at 20 hours, Figure ?Figure1B)1B) inhibition of pErk, although one of the cell lines (M263) had lower inhibition of pErk than the rest. There was no pErk inhibition in two cell lines with NRAS Q61L mutation (M202 and M207) and a cell line wild type for both oncogenes (M257). In fact, there was a markedly increased pErk signal in one NRAS Q61L mutated cell line (M207), an observation consistent with data from others that has been attributed to loss of negative regulatory pathways [16,17] and enhanced signaling through C-Raf [18,19]. Therefore, PLX4032 inhibits MAPK pathway signaling specifically in cell lines that harbor the BRAF V600E mutation. Differential sensitivity to PLX4032 in BRAF V600E mutated melanoma cell lines. Melanoma cell lines with different NRAS/BRAF mutational status were treated in vitro with a range of concentrations of PLX4032 for 5 days. The three cell lines without BRAF V600E mutation were resistant to PLX4032. Seven BRAF V600E mutant cell lines were sensitive to PLX4032, including four highly sensitive cell lines with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values below 1 \u00a5\u00ecM. Surprisingly, in three cell lines with BRAF V600E mutation we could not determine an IC 50 with increasing concentrations of PLX4032 up to 10 \u00a5\u00ecM, suggesting that these cell lines are resistant to this agent in a 5-day exposure in vitro (Figure ?(Figure1C).1C). Similar results have been obtained in 3-day viability assays and when PLX4032 is added daily to the cultures or just at the beginning of the experiment (data not shown). PLX4032 has similar inhibitory effects on cell cycle in sensitive and resistant BRAF V600E mutant cell lines. To study effects of PLX4032 on cell cycle progression downstream of B-Raf signaling we used propidium iodide flow cytometric staining. As expected, PLX4032 had no effect on cell cycle progression in melanoma cell lines without a BRAF V600E mutation (Figure ?(Figure2A).2A). In contrast, PLX4032 exposure for one (data not shown) or 20 hours (Figure ?(Figure2B2B and ?and2C)2C) led to a similar and profound G1 arrest in all BRAF V600E mutant cell lines regardless of their in vitro sensitivity to PLX4032. PLX4032 leads to apoptotic death in sensitive BRAF V600E but not in resistant BRAF V600E mutated melanoma cell lines. We then analyzed the ability of PLX4032 to differentially induce apoptotic effects against melanoma cell lines with the BRAF V600E mutation. Using a BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell line with a good response to PLX4032 (M249) and another one that was poorly responsive to PLX4032 (M233) based on cell viability assays, we analyzed apoptotic induction using flow cytometry based on the incorporation of propidium iodide and Annexin V. After PLX4032-treatment, the increase in Annexin V positive cells, with or without being double positive for propidium iodide, was greater in the PLX4032-responsive M249 cells compared to the poorly responding M233 cells (Figure ?(Figure2D2D and ?and2E).2E). Similar results were obtained with M238 and M263 (data not shown). Taken together with the data on cell cycle inhibition, these data suggest that PLX4032 has cytostatic effects in BRAF V600E mutant cell lines with a poor response, while it has cytostatic and cytotoxic effects in cell lines with a good response to PLX4032 in cell viability assays. Functional and genomic characterization of BRAF V600E mutated cell lines with different sensitivity to PLX4032. We tested if the differences in sensitivity to PLX4032 were due to markedly different doubling times. Resistant BRAF V600E mutated cell lines tended to have a slower doubling time compared to the sensitive BRAF V600E mutated cell lines (P = 0.24, Table ?Table1).1). The lack of significance was due to outliers in a small group, most notably the highly sensitive cell line M262 having a doubling time close to 50 hours. Interestingly, all cell lines homozygous for the BRAF V600E mutation were moderately to highly sensitive to PLX4032, and cell lines resistant to PLX4032 were all heterozygous for BRAF V600E (P = 0.16). However, there were also two highly sensitive heterozygous cell lines with IC 50 values below 1 \u00a5\u00ecM of PLX4032, and the sensitivity of homozygous cell lines spreads through one-log differences in PLX4032 concentrations (Table ?(Table1).1). We then used high throughput analysis of over 500 gene mutations using mass-spectrometry based genotyping [11] and high-density SNP arrays to explore other genomic alterations. Two different platforms (Illumina and Affymetrix) gave highly concordant results (data not shown) demonstrating that out of the 10 cell lines with BRAF V600E mutation, four have amplification of the BRAF locus (Table ?(Table1).1). There was no clear relationship between these amplification events and the BRAF V600E zygosity or the sensitivity to PLX4032. There were very few secondary mutations in this group of cell lines, with one cell line having a mutation in EGFR, and one cell line with a mutation in AKT (Table ?(Table1).1). In addition, the M257 cell line, which is wild type for both NRAS and BRAF and is highly resistant to PLX4032, was found to have 3 copies of wild type BRAF and a point mutation in CDKN2A. The distribution of amplification events in MITF and EGFR were also spread among the cell lines. Of note, there was no clear trend regarding the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway based on activating mutations, or amplifications of AKT1/2 segregating the resistant and sensitive cell lines. Supervised hierarchical clustering comparing SNP array data from PLX4032-resistant and -sensitive BRAF V600E mutant cell lines did not point to specific genomic areas with concordant alterations differentiating the two groups of cell lines. Modulation of MAPK and PI3k/Akt signaling pathways in sensitive and resistant cell lines. To further explore how cell lines with BRAF V600E mutation respond differently to PLX4032 we chose two extreme examples of cell lines with similar growth kinetics to perform an extended analysis of signaling pathways (Figure ?(Figure3).3). M229 is one of the two most sensitive cell lines, while M233 proved to be very resistant despite having a short in vitro doubling time (Table ?(Table1).1). Exposure to PLX4032 resulted in a marked decrease in pErk in both cell lines, but this was more prominent and durable in the sensitive M229 compared to the resistant M233. M229 has a heterozygous PTEN deletion by SNP array analysis, and had a detectable band for PTEN protein by Western blot that did not change with PLX4032 exposure. The resistant M233 cell line has a homozygous PTEN deletion and has no PTEN protein by Western blot. This correlates with baseline pAkt detectable in M233 but not M229, as well as increase in pAkt upon PLX4032-exposure in the resistant M233 but not in the sensitive M229 cell line. Interestingly, pS6 decreased in both cell lines upon PLX4032 exposure. Finally, we explored if there was modulation of AMPK, which has been recently described as a downstream modulator of glucose metabolism in BRAF V600E mutants [20]. There was a low level of induction of pAMPK. These studies demonstrate that PLX4032 has complex effects on MAPK and PI3k/Akt signaling pathways that may be dependent on secondary oncogenic events beyond B-Raf. Non-invasive imaging of PLX4032 anti-tumor activity. We analyzed the uptake profile of three different metabolic tracers that can be used in PET scans: two nucleoside analogs (thymidine and FAC [21]) and FDG, a glucose analog widely used as a PET tracer. As expected, BRAF wild type cell lines had no significant change in uptake of thymidine or FAC upon PLX4032-exposure. Conversely, all BRAF V600E mutated cell lines, irrespective of their sensitivity to PLX4032, had markedly decreased uptake of these two nucleoside analogues (Figure ?(Figure4a4a and ?and4b).4b). The greatest difference between PLX4032-sensitive and -resistant BRAF V600E mutants was in FDG uptake. The percentage decrease in FDG uptake was roughly double in PLX4032-sensitive BRAF V600E mutants compared to PLX4032-resistant cell lines (P = 0.009, Figure ?Figure4c).4c). Finally, we tested if [ 18F]-FDG uptake could be used as a pharmacodynamic marker of B-Raf V600E inhibition by PLX4032 in vivo. Mice with established subcutaneous M249 melanoma xenografts, a cell line highly sensitive to PLX4032 in vitro, were treated for 3 days with PLX4032 twice daily by oral gavage, and then analyzed by combined microPET and microCT using [ 18F]-FDG as PET tracer. There was a 32% decrease in [ 18F]-FDG uptake compared to the vehicle control mice, even though tumor sizes were not different at this early time point (Figure ?(Figure4d).4d). In conclusion, inhibition of [ 18F]-FDG uptake can be used as an early marker of effective B-Raf V600E inhibition by PLX4032. Discussion. The BRAF V600E mutation is one of the most common kinase domain mutations in human cancer with a particularly high incidence in malignant melanoma [3,7]. The Raf-inhibitors PLX4720 and PLX4032 have the preclinical characteristics of functioning as specific inhibitors of the BRAF V600E mutated kinase with a favorable profile compared to wild type kinases [9,22]. Understanding the patterns of sensitivity and resistance in melanomas with different oncogenic events is of high importance for clinical translation. Our studies confirmed the high specificity of PLX4032 for a subset of BRAF V600E mutant cell lines [22]. Surprisingly, we noted differences in the sensitivity to PLX4032, with some BRAF V600E mutants demonstrating resistance to the cytotoxic effects of PLX4032. In most cases, these cells had a tendency towards slower growth kinetics and being heterozygous for BRAF V600E. This differential response to PLX4032 in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell lines may be explained by several mechanisms. It may be that there is preferential MAPK pathway-addiction in sensitive cell lines, and cells with lower sensitivity are less dependent on the BRAF V600E oncogenic signaling, relying on the co-activation of other signaling pathways including the PI3K/Akt pathway. We explored this possibility with SNP arrays and high throughput oncogene sequencing with a particular interest in looking at this pathway. The genomic analysis revealed that alterations in PI3K/Akt, including deletions of PTEN, amplifications of AKT and activating mutations in AKT were distributed throughout the cell line list with no clear pattern of correlation with sensitivity or resistance to PLX4032. However, in two cell lines phospho-specific Western blot staining suggested that the resistant cell line had increased Akt signaling upon PLX4032 exposure. Another possibility is that PLX4032-resistant BRAF V600E mutants have alternative signaling at the level of Raf, as has been described for cell lines with acquired resistance to a different Raf-inhibitor, AZ628, which show increased signaling through C-Raf [23]. The increase in pErk in an NRAS Q61L mutant cell line could be explained by abrogation of negative feedback loops mediated mainly by dual specificity phosphatases (MKPs/DUSPs), as reported with Mek inhibitors [17,24], and the recent description of increased C-Raf signaling when heterodimerizing with inhibited B-Raf in BRAF wild type cells [18,19]. Therefore, the modulation of feed-back loops and alteration of Raf dimerization upon treatment with Raf inhibitors may also have a role in the differential sensitivity to PLX4032 in BRAF V600E mutant cell lines. Finally, differences in expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules like Bim and Bad [25] may allow some BRAF V600E mutant cell lines to undergo growth arrest but not die from apoptosis upon exposure to PLX4032. Studies are ongoing to further explore these possibilities. We explored the use of PET imaging as a mean to non-invasively detect PLX4032-sensitivity. In vitro we found that any of the three PET tracers FDG, FLT and FAC could be used to distinguish between melanomas with a NRAS or a BRAF V600E mutation based on the differential effects of PLX4032 on cell cycle and metabolism. FDG could furthermore be used to distinguish between BRAF V600E mutant melanomas with high or low sensitivity to PLX4032. The PI3K/Akt pathway has been widely regarded as having a role in the regulation of glucose metabolism through mTOR, but recently the LKB1-AMPK pathway has been found to be regulated by oncogenic BRAF V600E signaling [20], which together may explain the marked and rapid effects of PLX4032 on inhibiting FDG uptake. We explored this possibility in two cell lines. Our data suggests a minor increase in pAMPK upon PLX4032 exposure, which may be in line with the proposed hypothesis [20]. Conclusions. These studies in melanoma cell lines may allow to better interpret the results of a recently reported phase I clinical trial with PLX4032 [26], with an objective response in excess of 70% of patients with BRAF V600E positive metastatic melanoma. The characterization of PLX4032-sensitive and -resistant BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell lines may provide information about the molecular mechanisms that dictate sensitivity and resistance to PLX4032. In addition, molecular imaging with [ 18F]FDG PET scans may help in providing an early readout of complete or incomplete pharmacodynamic effects of PLX4032 and therefore predict lesions that may or may not respond to therapy.

                "text": "Targeting tissue factor on tumour cells and angiogenic vascular endothelial cells by factor VII-targeted verteporfin photodynamic therapy for breast cancer in vitro and in vivo in mice\tBackground. The objective of this study was to develop a ligand-targeted photodynamic therapy (tPDT) by conjugating factor VII (fVII) protein with photosensitiser verteporfin in order to overcome the poor selectivity and enhance the effect of non-targeted PDT (ntPDT) for cancer. fVII is a natural ligand for receptor tissue factor (TF) with high affinity and specificity. The reason for targeting receptor TF for the development of tPDT is that TF is a common but specific target on angiogenic tumour vascular endothelial cells (VEC) and many types of tumour cells, including solid tumours and leukaemia. Methods. Murine factor VII protein (mfVII) containing a mutation (Lys341Ala) was covalently conjugated via a cross linker EDC with Veterporfin (VP) that was extracted from liposomal Visudyne, and then free VP was separated by Sephadex G50 spin columns. fVII-tPDT using mfVII-VP conjugate, compared to ntPDT, was tested in vitro for the killing of breast cancer cells and VEGF-stimulated VEC and in vivo for inhibiting the tumour growth of breast tumours in a mouse xenograft model. Results. We showed that: (i) fVII protein could be conjugated with VP without affecting its binding activity; (ii) fVII-tPDT could selectively kill TF-expressing breast cancer cells and VEGF-stimulated angiogenic HUVECs but had no side effects on non-TF expressing unstimulated HUVEC, CHO-K1 and 293 cells; (iii) fVII targeting enhanced the effect of VP PDT by three to four fold; (iii) fVII-tPDT induced significantly stronger levels of apoptosis and necrosis than ntPDT; and (iv) fVII-tPDT had a significantly stronger effect on inhibiting breast tumour growth in mice than ntPDT. Conclusions. We conclude that the fVII-targeted VP PDT that we report here is a novel and effective therapeutic with improved selectivity for the treatment of breast cancer. Since TF is expressed on many types of cancer cells including leukaemic cells and selectively on angiogenic tumour VECs, fVII-tPDT could have broad therapeutic applications for other solid cancers and leukaemia. Background. Accumulating evidence suggests that the receptor tissue factor (TF) is expressed on endothelial cells of pathological blood vessels associated with solid tumours [1-6], wet macular degeneration (wMD) [7,8], and endometriosis[9] but not on endothelial cells of normal blood vessels [1-5,10-13], providing an accessible and specific therapeutic target for these diseases. Because its natural ligand, factor VII (fVII), binds TF with exceptionally high specificity and affinity (up to 10 -12 M) [14], we constructed an antibody-like immunoconjugate (Icon) by fusing two fVII peptides to an IgG1 Fc to target TF for the development of a novel immunotherapy [2-4]. Since the binding of fVII to TF would initiate an extrinsic coagulation cascade [15], we introduced a single mutation (K341A) to fVII peptide to reduce its coagulation activity while retaining its binding activity to TF [2,4]. The choice of mutation was based on a previous report [16], in which Dickinson et al. showed that the TF binding activity of K341A mutated fVII was indistinguishable from wild-type fVII, whereas its coagulation function was reduced about eight fold [16]. Delivery of the Icon cDNA by an adenoviral vector, or injection of the Icon protein, resulted in a cytolytic immune attack against the pathological vessels in mouse models of cancer [2-5], wMD [7,8], and endometriosis [9]. Here, we test the use of monomeric fVII peptide to target a laser-activatable photosensitiser to TF for the development of ligand-targeted photodynamic therapy (tPDT) of cells expressing TF, particularly for the angiogenic vascular endothelial cells (VECs) in solid tumours and the choroidal neovasculature of wMD. In the case of cancer, many types of cancer cells (including breast cancer cells) also over-express TF, providing additional target cells for fVII-targeted therapies. A widely used procedure for non-targeted PDT (ntPDT) of wMD involves intravenous injection of the photosensitiser Visudyne followed by irradiation of the eye with a laser emitting 689 nm light, in which Visudyne is activated by the laser light to generate singlet oxygen, resulting in cytoxicity and apoptosis of cells [17]. However, because the non-targeted photosensitiser could be absorbed by normal cells as well as by pathological cells, side effects may be associated with this procedure [18,19]. To improve the safety and efficacy of PDT, tPDT has been proposed and tested by conjugating the photosensitisers to antibodies or ligands for targeting to cells expressing the cognate antigen or receptor [20-23]. In this paper, we target the receptor TF by covalently conjugating its ligand, fVII protein, to VP for the development of a novel and effective fVII-tPDT for the treatment of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. Recently, we showed that this fVII-tPDT using the fVII-VP conjugate was also efficacious and safe for the treatment of wMD in a rat model [24]. In the course of the development of TF-targeted therapeutics, Hu and Garen have previously developed fVII(K341A)/IgG1 Fc (Icon) immunoconjugates for immunotherapy of cancer [2-5], wMD [7,8], and endometriosis[9]. Recently, Shoji and co-workers used an active site-inactivated recombinant human fVII (fVIIa) to target EF24, a synthetic curcumin analog, for TF-targeted cancer therapy [25]. To the best of our knowledge, this paper describes, for the first time, the use of fVII to target its cognate receptor TF for the development of ligand-tPDT, which has broad potential for the treatment of cancer and wMD [24]. Methods. Cell lines. Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 (CHO-K1, ATCC) cells were grown in F12 medium, murine breast cancer EMT6 and human embryonic kidney 293 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Albert Deisseroth during his tenure at Yale University) in DMEM and human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and 1:100 antibiotics (Sigma). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) purchased from Yale Vascular Biology and Transplantation Group were grown in M199 (Invitrogen) with 20% heat inactivated FBS, 1:100 antibiotics, and 1:100 Endothelial Cell Growth Supplement solution (ECGS, BD Biosciences). Construction of plasmid containing the mfVII cDNAs. The plasmid vector encoding mouse fVII peptide was constructed by PCR amplifying the mouse fVII cDNA with a K341A mutation from a previously constructed Icon (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF272773\",\"term_id\":\"9837149\",\"term_text\":\"AF272773\"}}AF272773) pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid vector as a DNA template [2] and by using high-fidelity Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and the following primers: 5'-primer 5'-ACGATCTTAAGCTTCCCCACAGTCTCATCATGGTTCCA-3' and 3'-primer 5'-AGTTTAGCGGCCGCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGGAGTTCATGTGCTGCCGCTCAAACTTGGCTGCTGCAGTTTCCTTGGATC CCAGTAGTGGGAGT-3'. The amplified mfVII (mfVII-Sp-His) cDNA contains the coding sequence for mfVII (K341A), a BamHI site, ribonuclease S-peptide [Sp (D14N), the first 15 amino acids at the N-terminus of bovine ribonuclease S [26]] and eight histidines (His tag), with a Hind III site at the 5'-end and a Not I site at the 3'-end. The S peptide (Sp or S tag) and polyhistidines (His tag) were designed to be included at the C-terminus of the fVII protein for protein purification and detection. The reason for using the Sp mutant (D14N) instead of wild-type Sp in the fVII protein is that Kim JS and Raines RT showed that Sp (D14N) had a higher affinity for S protein than wild-type Sp [26]. The PCR-amplified cDNAs were sequentially digested with Hind III and Not I and ligated into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). Production and purification of the mfVII protein. The mfVII plasmid was transfected into CHO-K1 cells using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen), and the transfectant clones were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Individual clones were isolated using Cloning Discs (Sigma) and grown in CHO serum-free medium (SFM) Excel 301 (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with a final concentration of 1 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml Vitamin K1 (Sigma) (for posttranslational modifications, particularly vitamin K-dependent \u00a5\u00e3-carboxylation of fVII protein) [2-4,27], and the SFM was collected every three to four days. The clone with the highest expression of mfVII protein was selected by Western blotting using anti-His tag antibody (Sigma) and expanded to 10 T175 flasks in F12-complete growth medium with a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Gibco). When the cells reached about 90% confluence, the cells were washed three times with PBS and switched to SFM with Vitamin K1 as described above. The SFM was collected twice a week. After centrifugation to remove the suspended cells, the SFM was pooled and stored at -20\u00a1\u00c6C until affinity purification. The mfVII was affinity purified using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). The purified protein was dialysed against PBS pH7.4 and concentrated to 1 mg/ml using a Millipore Centrifugal device (MWCO 10,000). The affinity-purified mfVII protein was characterised by SDS-PAGE for purity and molecular weight. The mfVII protein was conjugated with photosensitiser as described below or aliquoted and stored at -20\u00a1\u00c6C for future conjugation. Extraction and conjugation of Verteporfin to mfVII protein. Chemically pure form of Verteporfin (Benzoporphyrin derivative-monoacid ring A, BPD-MA, molecular weight 718.8) was not available at the time of the study so it was extracted from clinic-leftover liposomal Visudyne (QLT Inc) using an outlined procedure [28] with modifications as follows. Five \u00a5\u00ecl of 6 M HCl was added and mixed by vortexing to 300 \u00a5\u00ecl of Visudyne aqueous solution of clinically reconstituted liposomal formulation, in which the VP concentration was 2 mg/ml. Then, 500 \u00a5\u00ecl of dichloromethane (CH 2Cl 2) (Sigma) was added and mixed by vortexing, followed by centrifugation for 5 min. After centrifugation, the organic (VP, lower phase) and aqueous (liposome, upper phase) layers were visibly separated. The VP in the lower phase was carefully transferred to a glass tube and loaded to a freshly prepared silica gel column (Sigma) equilibrated in CH 2Cl 2/methanol (3:1). The VP was eluted using CH 2Cl 2/methanol (3:1), and the green fractions containing VP were collected, pooled in a glass beaker, aliquoted in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and dried in a SpeedVac. The weight of the VP powder was determined by subtracting the weight of the Eppendorf tube after dissolving and removing VP in dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma). The VP was adjusted to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml in DMF. A standard curve of VP dye was generated by serially diluting a known concentration of VP in DMF into de-ionised and distilled H 2O starting from 1000 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml. The equation was y = 0.00005 x - 0.0008 (R 2 = 0.9995), where y is the OD689 nm at a 1:50 dilution and x is the concentration of VP (\u00a5\u00ecg/ml). VP was conjugated to mfVII protein by EDC (N'-3-dimethylaminopropyl-N-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, Sigma) as a cross-linker, as previously described [29] but with modifications. VP was activated by mixing 6 \u00a5\u00ecl of DMF, 2 \u00a5\u00ecl of 10 mg/ml VP and 2 \u00a5\u00ecl of a 25-mg/ml solution of EDC in DMF. The 10-\u00a5\u00ecl reaction mixture was incubated at RT for 30 min, followed by the addition of 80 \u00a5\u00ecl of 1 mg/ml mfVII protein in PBS and incubation at RT for 1 hr. For the control, 80 \u00a5\u00ecl of PBS was added to a separate 10 \u00a5\u00ecl-reaction tube. The mfVII-VP conjugate was separated from unconjugated VP on a Sephadex G50 spin column (Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions. After separation, the mfVII-VP conjugate was scanned on a spectrophotometer (Beckman) from 200 nm to 800 nm to measure the protein absorbance at 280 nm and the absorbance at 689 nm for the VP concentration. Flow cytometry and cell ELISA for the binding activity of mfVII, mfVII-VP and mfVII/hIgG1 Fc Icon to human and mouse breast cancer cells. TF expression on breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and EMT-6 cells and the non-cancerous CHO-K1 cell line as a normal cell line control was determined by flow cytometry, using mouse Icon (mfVII/hIgG1 Fc) at a concentration of 10 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml followed by a 1:50-diluted anti-human IgG Fc secondary antibody FITC conjugate (Sigma), sorted on a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences) as described [2-4]. The binding activity of the mfVII and the mfVII-VP conjugate was determined by flow cytometry, similarly as described [2-4], and by cell-ELISA using MDA-MB-231 cells as described below. Briefly, after non-enzymatic dissociation, the cancer cells were blocked in HBSS/10 mM CaCl 2/1% BSA/0.05% NaN 3 (FACS buffer as wash and binding buffer), incubated with 20 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml (protein concentration) of mfVII or mfVII-VP conjugate, washed once, incubated with 20 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml goat IgG anti-murine fVII (R & D Systems), washed once, and then incubated with 20 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml secondary anti-goat IgG FITC (Vector Laboratories). After a final wash, the cells were resuspended in HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES pH7.3, 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl 2) supplemented with 2 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml propidum iodide (to distinguish live cells from dead cells) and analysed on a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences). The control was the same except for omitting the addition of mfVII proteins. Cell-ELISA was done as follows. MDA-MB-231 cells were grown overnight in 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells per well. Then the cells were washed once with pre-warmed TBS-Ca-T (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl 2, 0.1% Tween 20), fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (J.T. Baker) for 10 min at room temperature, washed three times with TBS-Ca-T buffer, and then blocked with 2% BSA at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 1 hr. After one wash, the cells were incubated with 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml mfVII or mfVII-VP conjugate diluted in TBS-Ca-T at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 1 hr. After three washes, 2 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml goat anti-mfVII (R & D Systems) was added to detect mfVII bound to the cancer cells. After three times washes, 100 \u00a5\u00ecl of OPD substrate solution (Sigma) was incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 min for color development and then was stopped by adding 50 \u00a5\u00ecl 4.5 N H 2SO4, and A490 nm was read using a microplate reader (Gemini). Binding activity was presented as A490 nm after being subtracted from average A490 nm of 0 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml control wells). Confocal imaging of TF expression on HUVECs with or without VEGF stimulation. HUVECs were grown on glass coverslips in growth medium with ECGS in six-well plates. After washing four times with PBS, Human Endothelial SFM (Invitrogen) was added to starve the cells overnight in order to eliminate TF expression due to stimuli in FBS and/or ECGS. A final concentration of 1.1 nM VEGF (BD Biosciences) in the SFM was incubated with the starved HUVECs for four hours to induce TF expression [30,31]. Unstimulated HUVEC controls were also starved but were not incubated with VEGF. Then, both the stimulated and unstimulated HUVECs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT, washed three times with HBSS-T (HBSS, 0.1% Triton-X 100, 10 mM CaCl 2), blocked with 1% BSA in HBSS-T at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for one hour, and then incubated with 10 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml monoclonal anti-human TF (American Diagnostica) or 10 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml mouse Icon, followed by an incubation with 1:50 anti-mouse or human IgG FITC (Sigma). To make sure these cells were of endothelium origin, the cells were stained with anti-human CD31 PE conjugate after staining for TF. The coverslips were mounted with anti-fade medium (Molecular Probes) on glass slides and observed and photographed under a confocal microscope (Zeiss L510). In vitro PDT. Cells were seeded with 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plates and grown overnight in growth medium. The next morning, the cells were incubated with VP, either in unconjugated form or as mfVII-VP conjugate, in HBSS supplemented with 10 mM CaCl 2, 1% BSA for 90 min at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and 5% CO 2. The cells were washed once, and 100 \u00a5\u00ecl of complete growth medium was added to each well. The cells were irradiated with a 689 nm laser at various energies (J/cm 2, 689 nm laser with adjustable power 0-300 mW/cm 2, B&W Tek Inc). Controls included laser light alone, no treatment and maximal killing control. The cells in the maximal killing control were the same as the no treatment control except that the cells were completely lysed by the addition of a 1/10 volume of 9% Triton X-100 for 45 min prior to the cell viability assay. Duplicate wells were used in all experiments. Cell viability by staining with crystal violet and reading absorbance at 595 nm (A595 nm) for loss of monolayer adherence to determine the effect of PDT in vitro. The choice of the cell viability assay using crystal violet staining was based on a previous work [32] with modification of reading A595 nm. Mickuvience et al. [32] compared several non-clonogenic assays for determining the effect of PDT on adherent cells in vitro and found that crystal violet staining for measuring the loss of monolayer adherence was the most sensitive assay, as compared to other non-clonogenic assays including [ 3H]-thymidine incorporation, LDH-release, MTT, trypan blue exclusion and CyQUANT. The viability assay by crystal violet staining was usually carried out at two to three days after PDT, when the cells in control wells reached 95% confluence. Briefly, the cells were washed once with PBS, then fixed with 3:1 mixed methanol: acetic acid at RT for 5 min. The plates were air-dried, and the cells were stained with 0.05% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 20 min at RT. After staining, the extracellular dye and background were removed by thoroughly rinsing the plates with tap water. The remaining cell-attached dye was dissolved in a 0.1% acetic acid solution in 50% ethanol. The dissolved dye solution was transferred into another 96-well plate, and the A595 recorded on a microplate reader. Blank acetic acid/ethanol solution was added to the 96-well plates as a blank control. Since the A595 nm readings in the maximal killing control wells were always greater than those in the medium alone control well due to crystal violet staining of the remained cell membrane debris, the percent of surviving cells (%) based on the A595 nm was calculated using the formula: Percent of surviving cells (%) = (experimental-maximal killing average)/(no treatment control average-maximal killing average) \u00a1\u00bf 100%. Killing mechanisms of VP PDT. After the cancer cells in 96-well plates were treated by tPDT or ntPDT as described above, the plates were centrifuged and half of the culture supernatant in each well was transferred to another 96-well plate for assaying cytotoxicity, while the original plate with the cells containing the other half of the culture supernatant was assayed for cell apoptosis. The Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 assay (Promega) was used for measuring caspase-3/7 activity and presented relative fluorescent units (relative fluorescent units = experimental fluorescent units - average fluorescent units in no treatment control wells) as evidence of apoptosis, and the CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) was used for measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; a stable cytosolic enzyme that is released upon cell lysis and can be used as an indicator of necrosis) in the culture supernatants as evidence of cytotoxicity in the PDT-treated cancer cells following the manufacturer's instructions. The percent of cytotoxicity (%) based on the OD490 nm was calculated using the following formula: Percent of cytotoxicity (%) = (PDT treated cells-no treatment control average)/(maximal killing control average-no treatment control average) \u00a1\u00bf 100%. Animal models of mouse and human tumour xenografts and PDT in vivo. The animal study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Yale University. To generate the subcutaneous xenograft model, mouse breast cancer EMT6 cells were subcutaneously injected into female 4-6-week-old Balb/c mice (Taconic Farms Inc) with 1 or 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells per mouse as described in the figure legends. When the tumour size reached about 100 mm 3, mfVII-VP or unconjugated VP was intravenously injected into mice at a final concentration of 2 \u00a5\u00ecM VP by an estimate of 1 ml of circulating blood per mouse at a body weight of 20 grams. Control mice were i.v. injected with sterile saline. After 90 min, the tumours were irradiated with 689 nm laser light at 105 J/cm 2 while the mice were under anaesthesia with intraperitoneal injection of Ketamine and Xylazine. There were five mice in each group in all animal experiments. The PDT treatment was done a total of four or six times, as indicated in the figure legends. The tumour size was measured in two dimensions with a calliper, and the tumour volume was calculated by the formula: (width) 2 (length)/2, as described previously [2-4]. The percentage of tumour growth was calculated by the formula: each individual tumour/its initial volume on day 0 \u00a1\u00bf 100%. Statistical analyses. The data on in vitro and in vivo effects were presented as mean values \u00a1\u00be standard deviations using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software) and were analysed for significance between the treated group and the control group using the ANOVA (single factor, one-way with Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test or two-way ANOVA) methods. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. For analyses of statistical significance, duplicate wells in each group were used for all in vitro PDT experiments in tissue culture plates and five mice per group were used for the in vivo animal studies, unless specified. The equations for half-maximal effective concentrations (EC 50) were generated and calculated using Microsoft Excel and Prism 5 software. Results. Characterisations of extracted VP, mfVII, and mfVII-VP conjugate. After extraction, the spectrum of VP is different from that of visudyne before extraction, and the peak at 280 nm disappeared in the spectrum of VP (Figure ?(Figure1A).1A). More importantly, we observed that free VP dye extracted from visudyne was held in Sephedex G-50 spin columns, whereas visudyne passed the spin columns into collection tubes, indicating that the extraction of VP made the downstream separation of free dye from the conjugated dye possible by Sephedex G-50 spin columns. The molecular weight of mfVII was about 52.8 kDa, as calculated based on the migration in SDS-PAGE (Figure ?(Figure1B).1B). After conjugation of mfVII-VP, conjugated VP could be separated from the unconjugated free dye using Sephadex G-50 spin columns. Green solution (VP) was only present in the collection tubes in the reactions containing both VP and protein. In contrast, the green dye was held in the resin of the spin columns in the PBS control reaction, indicating that the VP in the collection tubes was successfully attached to mfVII. Spectrum scanning analyses (Figure ?(Figure1C)1C) confirmed that the mfVII-VP conjugate had absorbance peaks at both 280 nm (protein peak) and 689 nm (Q-band of VP peaks), whereas free dye and mfVII had a single absorbance peak at 689 nm or 280 nm, respectively. These results indicate that VP was not only successfully conjugated to mfVII but also that free VP was separated from the conjugate. The molar ratio of VP to mfVII protein was 13.1 \u00a1\u00be 2.6 (mean \u00a1\u00be SD from 15 separate conjugation reaction experiments). The flow cytometry (Figure ?(Figure1D)1D) and cell ELISA (Figure ?(Figure1E)1E) results showed that both the VP-conjugated mfVII and unconjugated mfVII had similar binding activity to breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (P = 0.096 by paired t test in Figure ?Figure1E),1E), indicating that attaching the dye did not reduce the binding activity of mfVII to the cancer cells. TF expression on breast cancer cells and HUVECs. As shown in Figure ?Figure2,2, human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and murine breast cancer EMT6 cells express TF, but CHO-K1 cells do not (Figure ?(Figure2A).2A). The reason for the choice of a Hamster cell line (CHO-K1) as a TF-negative cell control is because there were very few immortalised normal human cells for potential use as the TF-negative control, one of which used in this study was human embryonic kidney 293 cell line provided by Dr. Albert Deisseroth. In addition, TF expression was only detected by both mfVII/hIgG1 Fc Icon and anti-TF antibody on VEGF-stimulated HUVECs but not on unstimulated HUVECs (Figure ?(Figure2B),2B), indicating that TF is specifically expressed on angiogenic VECs, such as those in the tumour neovasculature of human breast cancer from patients [1] and human melanoma tumor xenografts from mice [2]. fVII-targeting improved the selectivity for VP PDT. We first optimised the incubation time and showed that the strongest killing effect of fVII-tPDT (2 \u00a5\u00ecM VP and 60 J/cm 2) on human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells occurred when the incubation time with fVII-VP conjugate was 90 min (Figure ?(Figure3A).3A). Therefore, we decided to use 90 min as the drug (fVII-VP conjugate)-laser light interval. Then, we showed in Figure ?Figure3B3B that 2 \u00a5\u00ecM VP with fVII-tPDT had no effect on non-TF expressing CHO-K1 cells (Figure ?(Figure2A),2A), as an example of a normal cell line, whereas ntPDT had the side effect of killing CHO-K1 cells even at 1 \u00a5\u00ecM VP concentration (P < 0.001 for fVII-tPDT vs. ntPDT at each VP concentration by two-way ANOVA). Furthermore, fVII-tPDT (60 J/cm 2) even at 5 \u00a5\u00ecM did not have any side effects on a non-TF expressing 293 cell line (Figure ?(Figure3C)3C) (P > 0.05 vs. controls by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test), whereas ntPDT (60 J/cm 2) had significant effect on 293 cells even at 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecM (Figure ?(Figure3C)3C) (P < 0.05 or < 0.001 for 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecM and 5 \u00a5\u00ecM ntPDT as compared to controls and 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecM fVII-tPDT, respectively, by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test). Note that VP and laser alone did not have any toxicity to the cancer cells (Figure ?(Figure3A)3A) and normal 293 cells (Figure ?(Figure3C).3C). We conclude that fVII targeting significantly improves the selectivity of VP PDT. To determine the effect and selectivity of tPDT for tumour angiogenic VEC, we used HUVEC as normal VEC control, which does not express TF until being stimulated with VEGF (Figure ?(Figure2B),2B), a potent angiogenic growth factor. We showed that fVII-tPDT at 2 \u00a5\u00ecM VP and a light dose of 36 J/cm 2 killed almost 90% of VEGF-stimulated HUVEC cells (Figure ?(Figure3D),3D), which represent angiogenic tumour VECs in pathological angiogenesis, but had no effect on unstimulated HUVEC cells (Figure ?(Figure3D)3D) (P < 0.001 at all three VP concentrations for VEGF-stimulated vs. unstimulated by two-way ANOVA), which do not express TF and represent normal VECs (Figure ?(Figure2B).2B). In contrast, ntPDT even at 1 \u00a5\u00ecM VP and the same light dose (36 J/cm 2) killed both the VEGF-stimulated and the unstimulated HUVEC cells without any selectivity (Figure ?(Figure3E)3E) (P > 0.05 for VEGF-stimulated vs. unstimulated by two-way ANOVA), suggesting that fVII targeting indeed improved the PDT selectivity between normal and pathological vascular endothelial cells. Since 2 \u00a5\u00ecM VP in fVII-tPDT did not have any effect on killing normal cell lines in both cases of CHO-K1 and unstimulated HUVEC cells, the VP concentration of 2 \u00a5\u00ecM was chosen in the efficacy tests of fVII-tPDT in vitro and in vivo thereafter. Taken together, these results indicate that tPDT by fVII to TF could not only distinguish tumour cells from normal cells but could also distinguish tumour angiogenic VECs from normal quiescent VECs. Improved effect of fVII-targeted PDT as compared to ntPDT. The PDT results with breast cancer cell lines showed that the effect of tPDT was stronger than those of ntPDT on killing both human and mouse breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and EMT6 cells with a VP concentration-dependent response and that fVII targeting decreased by about three to four fold the EC 50 concentration of VP (Figure 4A-B), indicating that fVII targeting improved the effect. Moreover, when the VP concentration was 2 \u00a5\u00ecM, the EC 50 of the laser energy in tPDT was about half of that in ntPDT (Figure ?(Figure4C),4C), further indicating that fVII targeting could also reduce laser exposure, which could decrease the risk of side effects of ntPDT. As shown in Figure ?Figure4D,4D, the effect of fVII-tPDT, presented as percent of surviving cells, was partially inhibited at a ratio of 1:1 (unconjugated mfVII: VP-conjugated mfVII) (59.4 \u00a1\u00be 0.4%) and almost completely inhibited at ratios of 10:1 and 50:1 (90.6 \u00a1\u00be 5.9% and 94.8 \u00a1\u00be 4.7%, respectively), as compared to no addition of mfVII (cell survival percent was 37.4 \u00a1\u00be 14.8% at the ratio of 0:1) (P > 0.05, < 0.05 and < 0.01 for 0:1 vs. 1:1, 10:1 and 50:1, respectively, by one-way ANOVA), indicating that the effect was mediated by mfVII binding to TF. Killing mechanisms induced by VP PDT. The results in Figure ?Figure55 show that both apoptosis and cytotoxicity were induced in the MDA-MB-231 cancer cells treated by tPDT and ntPDT, but tPDT induced significantly stronger apoptosis (Figure ?(Figure5A)5A) and cytotoxicity (Figure ?(Figure5B)5B) than ntPDT (P < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test), which was consistent with the results of therapeutic effect as determined by clonogenic assay (Figure ?(Figure5C)5C) (P < 0.0001). The Caspase 3/7 activity was the highest at 12 hrs compared to those at 8 and 16 hrs after PDT, and the LDH activity in the cytotoxicity assays was higher at 1 hr than that at 4 hrs after PDT. Effect of tPDT on cancer in vivo in mice bearing mouse breast cancer. As shown in Figure ?Figure6A,6A, fVII-tPDT at 2 \u00a5\u00ecM of VP was effective in inhibiting the tumour growth of murine breast cancer in mice (P < 0.01 vs. control by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test) (3-4 mice per group in Figure ?Figure6A).6A). In contrast, ntPDT did not have any effect (P = 0.979 by ANOVA single factor). Moreover, the results in Figure ?Figure6B6B show that tPDT with either 2 \u00a5\u00ecM or 4 \u00a5\u00ecM VP had significant therapeutic effects as compared to controls (P < 0.001 vs. control by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test). However, increasing the VP concentration from 2 \u00a5\u00ecM to 4 \u00a5\u00ecM did not significantly further enhance the efficacy (P = 0.744 by ANOVA single factor) (five mice per group in Figure ?Figure6B),6B), indicating that tPDT with 2 \u00a5\u00ecM VP in the mfVII-VP conjugate reached the optimal therapeutic potential under the experimental conditions (Figure ?(Figure6B),6B), probably due to the saturation of the binding of the target cells by fVII in the fVII-VP conjugate. The mice were observed for any signs of toxicities during the experiments and examined morphologically at the time of euthanisation. All of the mice, including the controls and the PDT-treated mice, in the experiment in Figure ?Figure6A6A were normal, and no metastases were found in any of the mice. In the experiment in Figure ?Figure6B,6B, all of the control mice had enlarged spleens and one mouse had liver and peritoneal metastases. All of the mice treated by fVII-tPDT had no enlarged spleens, but one mouse in the 4 \u00a5\u00ecM fVII-tPDT group had peritoneal metastases, although its subcutaneous tumour responded to the fVII-tPDT treatment, suggesting that fVII-tPDT as a localised therapy had a limited ability to penetrate and therefore had no effect on metastatic or internal tumours located beyond the penetration ability of the 689 nm laser light. No other signs of side effects were observed in these mice. In addition, whole mouse body weights were measured during the period of the experiments, and no differences and no losses of body weight between the control groups and the treatment groups were observed, indicating that the tPDT procedure under the studied conditions was not toxic to mice. Discussion. Photodynamic therapy is a treatment involving three key components: a photosensitiser, light, and tissue oxygen. It can be used as a stand-alone modality or in combination with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or anti-angiogenic therapy [33] for cancer. However, ntPDT can cause severe side effects due to the poor selectivity of photosensitisers [18,19]. To overcome the poor selectivity and improve the effect, targeting of the photosensitisers with antibody and ligand has been tested [20-24,34-36], with the hope of specifically targeting the diseased cells and then internalising the photosensitisers into the target cells. In this paper, we target the receptor TF for the development of a novel fVII-targeted verteporfin PDT. The reason for targeting TF is based on its over-expression in many types of cancer cells, including solid cancers [1-6,12,25,37] and leukaemia [38-40], and very importantly its selective expression in pathological neovascular endothelial cells in cancer [1,2,4], choroidal neovasculature [7,8] and endometriosis [9] but not on normal VECs [1,2,4,7,8]. Garen and Hu have targeted TF using its natural ligand fVII for the development of Icon (fVII/IgG1 Fc) immunotherapy [2-4], which showed dramatic efficacy for treatment of several types of cancer [2-5], wMD [7,8] and endometriosis [9] in animal models. The results in Figure ?Figure2B2B confirmed that TF expression was only detected on VEGF-stimulated angiogenic HUVECs but not on unstimulated quiescent normal HUVECs. The results in Figure ?Figure2B2B also showed that fVII-containing mouse Icon could bind to angiogenic HUVECs but not normal resting HUVECs, providing the basis and rationale that fVII-tPDT that could selectively kill angiogenic VECs but have no side effects on unstimulated HUVECs (Figure ?(Figure3D),3D), whereas ntPDT could not distinguish angiogenic VECs from normal VECs for killing (Figure ?(Figure3E).3E). The reasons for using fVII instead of making antibodies to TF are that: (i) the affinity (Kda) of fVII to TF (10 -12 M) [14] is far higher than that of antibodies to TF (10 -8 to 10 -9 M)[41,42], and (ii) therapeutic and diagnostic fVII-containing proteins can be made in human sequence by DNA recombinant technologies for future clinical trials and usages in murine sequence for tests in preclinical studies. To develop fVII-tPDT, we first tested and conjugated dimeric Icon protein (fVII/IgG1 Fc, molecular weight ~210 kDa, unpublished data) with various photosensitisers in our preliminary studies. For better penetration into tumour tissues, we decided to make a smaller monomeric fVII protein fused with S-tag [26] and His-tag (molecular weight = 52,800 daltons, Figure ?Figure1B).1B). Both the S-tag and His-tag can be used for purification and detection. In addition, since the conjugation of photosensitisers to targeting antibodies or ligands could possibly reduce or even abolish the binding activity of targeting proteins, Alan Garen and Zhiwei Hu proposed to use S protein/S peptide [26] as a delivery system for the development of targeted PDT, in which S peptide is synthesised with the targeting protein molecules, e.g., mfVII in this case, by a recombinant DNA technique and then commercially available S protein is conjugated with the photosensitisers (unpublished data). Since conjugation of VP to mfVII did not affect the fVII binding activities to cancer cells (Figure 1D-1E), it was not necessary to use the S protein/S peptide system as the two components delivery system for the development of VP tPDT in this paper. Nevertheless, this S protein/S peptide system could be useful for those targeting molecules if their binding activities are reduced or abolished after direct conjugation with photosensitisers for tPDT. Visudyne is approved for the treatment of wet macular degeneration in clinical settings and is being tested as ntPDT for cancer in preclinical studies [43]. In our pilot studies, we first conjugated fVII protein with Visudyne using EDC, which had been used in combination with NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) to conjugate a scFv antibody to SnCe6 [29]. We observed that free Visudyne could not be separated from the conjugated dye by Sephadex G50 spin columns. This indicated that the other components in the liposomal formulation of VP could interfere with the separation of unconjugated VP from the conjugated dye. Therefore, it was necessary to extract the active component of benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD-MA) from Visudyne, which is referred to here as VP. When using the extracted VP, free VP was held in the size exclusion Sephadex G50 spin columns when PBS buffer alone was added to the EDC-activated VP reaction (PBS-VP control in Figure ?Figure1C).1C). This was the reason for the lack of a Q-band absorbance peak in the PBS-VP control after being separated by the spin column (Figure ?(Figure1C).1C). A better source of VP for the conjugation reaction, of course, is a chemically synthesised pure formulation of VP (BPD-MA), which was not available to us at the time when we carried out the experiments reported here. Nevertheless, VP either extracted from Visudyne or synthesised in pure formulation has been targeted with homing peptide for VEGF receptor or single chain Fv antibodies for treatment of wMD [28] and cancer [34,36], respectively. Although those previous papers used a different conjugation procedure, the molar ratio of VP to scFv was 14.1:1 [34,36], which is similar to the ratios of VP to mfVII (13.1 \u00a1\u00be 2.6:1, mean \u00a1\u00be SD from 15 separate conjugation reactions). However, Bhatti et al. noticed that there was 30% of non-covalent binding VP present in the final conjugates [36], possibly due to inefficient separation of free dye by the use of a dialysis procedure. Considering that the molecular weight of mfVII protein (52.8 kDa) is bigger than that of scFv (30 kDa) [36], our results of VP-to-fVII ratios were not surprising. Bhatti et al. also found that the IC50 of VP (1.4 \u00a5\u00ecM) in anti-HER2 C6.5 scFv-targeted VP PDT was about four-fold less than that (5.4 \u00a5\u00ecM) in free VP PDT for the HER 2+ SKOV-3 ovarian cancer line, indicating that scFv targeting improved the effect of VP PDT for that cancer line in vitro by about four fold. Their observations were similar to our results, although the EC 50 of VP in fVII-tPDT (0.25 \u00a5\u00ecM for human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and 0.33 \u00a5\u00ecM for murine breast cancer EMT6 in Figure 4A-4B) was about one fifth or one third of that (1.4 \u00a5\u00ecM) in the previous paper [36]. In vivo studies were not done with scFv-VP or free VP PDT in the previous papers [34,36]. In this paper we showed that fVII-tPDT had a significantly stronger effect than ntPDT for the treatment of breast cancer in mice (Figure ?(Figure6A).6A). The reason that ntPDT did not have the effect in vivo but had the effect in vitro is probably because liposomal components had been removed, so that the transportation of liposome-free VP to the tumour mass by intravenous injection was not as efficient as that of the liposomal formulation of Visudyne, although there was no problem for transportation because VP was directly incubated with the test cells. Further increasing the VP concentration in the fVII-VP conjugate did not further increase the effect of fVII-tPDT in the current setting, probably because fVII even at the lower concentration had reached the saturation binding to the tumour vasculature. Therefore, it is possible to get stronger effect by increasing the laser light fluence (but not VP concentration) in future experiments. Taking the in vitro and in vivo results reported in this paper together with the major findings in our recent paper on fVII-tPDT for wMD [24], we conclude that this novel fVII-targeted VP PDT improves the selectivity and efficacy of free VP PDT for the treatment of breast cancer and wMD and induces apoptosis and necrosis as the underlining mechanisms of action. For future clinical trials, we have constructed human fVII proteins with a lys341Ala mutation, similarly by recombinant DNA technology, for fVII-tPDT for patients with cancer or wMD. To establish additional proof of principle, our laboratory has developed and tested another fVII-tPDT using another potent photosensitiser, Sn(IV) chlorin e6, and the results showed that fVII-targeted SnCe6 PDT was more selective and also safe for the treatment of breast and lung cancer in vitro and in vivo in mice (Hu et al. Breast Cancer Research and Treatment. In press). Conclusions. In this paper we describe for the first time the development of a novel and effective ligand-targeted PDT for breast cancer by conjugating fVII, a natural ligand with high affinity and specificity for TF, with the US FDA-approved photosensitiser veterporfin. Since TF is specifically expressed on angiogenic tumour VECs [1-5] and is also overexpressed by many types of cancer cells including solid cancers [1-6,12,25,37] and leukaemia [38-40], and since fVII-targeted VP PDT showed a stronger effect and better selectivity than free VP PDT for breast cancer in vitro and in vivo, we anticipate that this fVII-VP tPDT could have broad therapeutic potential for primary and metastatic tumours, not only for breast cancers but also for other tumours, as long as these tumours are laser light-accessible and express TF on their tumour cells and/or tumour VECs.

In this study, we aimed to further understand how SHP1 interacts and regulates NPM-ALK. We employed an in vitro model in which GP293 cells were transfected with various combinations of NPM-ALK (or mutants) and SHP1 (or mutants) expression vectors. We found that SHP1 co-immunoprecipitated with NPM-ALK, but not the enzymatically inactive NPM-ALK K210R mutant, or the mutant in which all three functionally important tyrosine residues (namely, Tyr 338, Tyr 342, and Tyr 343) in the kinase activation loop (KAL) of ALK were mutated. Interestingly, whereas mutation of Tyr 338 or Tyr 342 did not result in any substantial change in the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding (assessed by co-immunoprecipitation), mutation of Tyr 343 abrogated this interaction. Furthermore, the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding was readily detectable when each of the remaining 8 tyrosine residues known to be phosphorylated were mutated. Although the expression of SHP1 effectively reduced the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of NPM-ALK, it did not affect that of the NPM-ALK Y343F mutant. In soft agar clonogenic assay, SHP1 expression significantly reduced the tumorigenicity of NPM-ALK but not that of NPM-ALK Y343F. In conclusion, we identified Tyr 343 of NPM-ALK as the crucial site for mediating the NPM-ALK/SHP1 interaction. Our results also support the notion that the tumor suppressor effects of SHP1 on NPM-ALK are dependent on its ability to bind to this oncogenic protein. Introduction. ALK 2-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK +ALCL) is a distinct type of aggressive lymphoma of T/null cell immunophenotypes (1). Approximately 80% of these neoplasms have the chromosomal translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35), which brings the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene at 5q35 in juxtaposition with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene at 2p23, leading to the formation of NPM-ALK (2,?5). ALK is normally a receptor-tyrosine kinase expressed exclusively on the cell surface of embryonic neuronal cells (6). It has been shown that the oligomerization domain of the NPM portion in this fusion gene protein induces dimerization of ALK, which results in autophosphorylation and constitutive activation of the ALK tyrosine kinase (7, 8). By virtue of its constitutively active tyrosine kinase, it is believed that NPM-ALK promotes tumorigenesis by aberrantly phosphorylating various tyrosine residues of a host of cellular signaling proteins, thereby deregulating a large number of cellular signaling pathways (9). In addition to the expression of NPM-ALK, recent studies also revealed the existence of multiple coexisting biochemical defects in NPM-ALK-expressing lymphomas (10,?15). The loss of SHP1, a cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase, serves as an example (14). SHP1 is normally expressed at the highest level in hematopoietic cells and it is known to act as a negative regulator of various cell signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT pathway and that of the T-/B-cell receptor (16). The biological importance of SHP1 is highlighted by the phenotype of the so-called \u00a1\u00b0moth-eaten\u00a1\u00b1 mice; specifically, homozygous mutations of the SHP1 gene, which results in a complete loss of SHP1 expression, are associated with severe dysregulation of the leukocyte development and systemic autoimmunity (17, 18). SHP1 also has been shown to have tumor suppressor functions. Specifically, loss of SHP1 has been demonstrated in a proportion of T-cell lymphomas, including the majority of the ALK +ALCL cases (10, 12, 19). Importantly, restoration of SHP1 expression has been shown to decrease the growth of ALK +ALCL cells in vitro. In another study, decreased expression of SHP1 has been shown to be associated with the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (20). Previous studies have shown that SHP1 is physically associated with NPM-ALK, and SHP1 dephosphorylates NPM-ALK (14, 21). However, the molecular details underlying the physical and functional interaction between SHP-1 and NPM-ALK are incompletely understood. Because NPM-ALK is known to interact with its binding partners via the phospho-Tyr/SH2 motif (7, 22,?24), one of the main objectives of this study was to identify the exact tyrosine residue of NPM-ALK involved in mediating its interaction with SHP1. We focused our search on the 11 tyrosine residues of NPM-ALK that have been previously found to be phosphorylated (25). Similarly, because SHP1 is known to interact with its substrates via one or both of its two SH2 domains, commonly termed N-SH2 (i.e. close to the N terminus) and C-SH2 (i.e. close to the C terminus) (26), we focused our studies on the roles of these two domains of SHP1 in the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding. After we identified the exact tyrosine residue of NPM-ALK that is important for the physical interaction between NPM-ALK and SHP1, we examined the functional importance of this physical interaction in SHP1-mediated suppression on NPM-ALK. MATERIALS AND METHODS.  An ALK +ALCL cell line, Karpas 299, was used. These cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 2 mm l-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)(Invitrogen). GP293, a human embryonic kidney cell line, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 4 g/liter of glucose supplemented with 10% FBS.  The wild-type SHP1 plasmid has been previously described (14). SHP1 mutants with Arg \u00a1\u00e6 Lys mutation of one or both of the two functionally important arginine residues (Arg 32 and Arg 138) located in the N-terminal and C-terminal SH2 domains, respectively, were kind gifts from Dr. F. Bohmer (Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany) (27). Phosphatase inactive SHP1 (SHP1 C445S) that has a point mutation (Cys \u00a1\u00e6 Ser) at the critical cysteine residue in the phosphatase domain was a kind gift from Dr. Zhenbao Yu (National Research Council of Canada, Montreal, Canada) (28). The NPM-ALK expression vector, a kind gift from Dr. S. Morris (St. Jude's Children Research Hospital, Memphis, TN), was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). The use of the \u00a1\u00b0kinase-dead\u00a1\u00b1 NPM-ALK (NPM-ALK K210R) has been previously described (29). The NPM-ALK FFF mutant, which was generated by mutating all three tyrosine residues in the kinase activation loop of ALK (Tyr 338, Tyr 342, and Tyr 343) in a pcDNA3.1(+)/His-tagged NPM-ALK backbone, has also been described (25). Similarly, the single Tyr \u00a1\u00e6 Phe mutants of NPM-ALK (i.e. site-directed mutagenesis of Tyr 138, Tyr 152, Tyr 156, Tyr 191, Tyr 419, Tyr 567, Tyr 644, and Tyr 664) were constructed on a pcDNA3.1(+)/NPM-ALK backbone. The coding sequences of NPM-ALK and all mutants were confirmed to ensure that no artificial mutations were acquired.  GP293 cells were plated in a 100-mm cell culture dish 24 h before gene transfection to obtain cell confluence of \u00a1\u00ad70%. Gene transfection of NPM-ALK alone or in combination with SHP1 were done using TurboFect TM in vitro Transfection Reagent (Fermentas, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transient transfection of Karpas 299 cells (4 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells) with 10 \u00a5\u00ecg of DNA of wild-type SHP1 or different SHP1 mutants were performed using the Electro square electroporator, BTX ECM 800 (San Diego, CA) at 225 V (8.5 ms, 03 pulses).  Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after gene transfection. For immunoprecipitation, a standard protocol was used as previously described (30). Briefly, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using Cell Lytic Buffer M (Sigma) supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), a protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Inc., San Diego, CA), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany). After incubating the lysate on ice for 30 min, it was centrifuged at 15,000 \u00a1\u00bf g for 15 min. Two micrograms of the primary antibody was added to 500 \u00a5\u00ecg of protein lysate and rotated overnight at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C. Negative control samples with the primary antibody omitted were included. 50 \u00a5\u00ecl of protein (A/G Plus-agarose) beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to both the test and control lysates and rocked for 2 h at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C. The beads were then washed 3 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the final wash was done using cold cell lysis buffer. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the final wash was done using RIPA buffer. Proteins were then eluted from the beads in 20 \u00a5\u00ecl of SDS protein loading buffer by boiling for 5 min at 100 \u00a1\u00c6C. The complex was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, and the proteins were visualized using enzyme chemiluminescence (Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting: goat polyclonal anti-ALK, rabbit polyclonal anti-SHP1 (both were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-ALK (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), mouse anti-SHP1 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ALK (Tyr 1604), anti-phosphotyrosine (both were from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and anti-\u00a5\u00e2-actin (Sigma). Western blot analysis is described as follows: cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cellular proteins were precipitated using RIPA buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), which was supplemented with 40 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml of leupeptin, 1 \u00a5\u00ecm pepstatin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentration of the samples was determined using the BCA Protein assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Cell lysates were then electrophoresed on 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, the membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween buffer for 1 h (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) and then incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C. After 3 washes with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, the membranes were incubated with the isotype-specific secondary antibody conjugated with the horseradish peroxidase (Cedarlane Laboratories, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by 3 washes with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, and the protein was detected using the chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce).  The soft agar consisted of two layers, both of which were prepared from a stock 1.2% Bacto-agar (Difco, Detroit, MI) dissolved in distilled water and autoclaved. For the bottom layer, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to the stock agar to achieve a 0.6% agar concentration. For the top layer, cell suspension (20,000 cells in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS) was mixed with the stock agar to achieve a final agar concentration of 0.3%. Cells in the agar were fed with 200 \u00a5\u00ecl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS every 2 days. Colonies were stained and visualized with 0.05% crystal violet after 4 weeks of culture.  The association between SHP1 and the number of colonies formed in soft agar was evaluated using Student's t test. A p value \u00a1\u00c2 0.05 is considered statistically significant. RESULTS.  Based on a number of previously published studies (23, 29, 31, 32), the binding between NPM-ALK and partners is typically dependent on the autophosphorylation and activation status of NPM-ALK. Thus, we asked if the activation status of NPM-ALK is important to the physical interaction between SHP1 and NPM-ALK. To address this question, we co-transfected GP293 cells with SHP1 and NPM-ALK or the enzymatically inactive NPM-ALK K210R mutant. As shown in Fig. 1, SHP1 co-immunoprecipitated with NPM-ALK (lane 2); it did not bind the NPM-ALK K210R mutant (lane 3). We performed similar experiments using another NPM-ALK mutant, in which all three functionally important tyrosine residues in the kinase activation loop (KAL) of ALK have been mutated (labeled as FFF) (25, 33). As shown in lane 4, SHP1 also did not associate with the FFF mutant.  We have previously shown that mutations of one or more of the three tyrosine residues in the KAL of ALK result in a dramatic decrease in the number of phosphorylated tyrosine residues on NPM-ALK, its ability to phosphorylate substrates and its tumorigenicity (25). Our previously published data showed that Tyr 338 is the first tyrosine residue in the KAL to be phosphorylated and it appears to be functionally more important than Tyr 342 and Tyr 343 (25). With this background, we assessed how mutation of each one of these three tyrosine residues in the KAL affects the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding. As shown in Fig. 2, mutation of Tyr 338, which was previously shown to dramatically decrease the overall level of tyrosine phosphorylation of NPM-ALK and the ability of NPM-ALK to phosphorylate various downstream targets, did not result in any substantial change in the binding between NPM-ALK and SHP1 (lane 2). Similarly, a relatively strong SHP1 binding was evident with the Tyr 342 mutant (lane 3). In contrast, mutation of Tyr 343 resulted in a complete loss of SHP1 binding detectable by our co-immunoprecipitation experiments (lane 4). Double mutation of Tyr 342 and Tyr 343 also abrogated the binding (lane 5), highlighting the importance of the Tyr 343 residue in mediating the NPM-ALK/SHP1 interaction.  To explain why mutation of Tyr 343 results in the dramatic loss of SHP1 binding, we performed peptide sequence analysis, and assessed if Tyr 343 falls into any of the known consensus sequences that can be recognized by SHP1. In this regard, we found a consensus sequence, (XXpY(Y/F)K/R) (34), present in a segment spanning Tyr 343 (namely ASY 342Y 343R). In contrast, Tyr 338 of NPM-ALK was not found to fall into any specific consensus sequences recognizable by SHP1. This finding further supports that Tyr 343 represents the crucial binding site between NPM-ALK and SHP1, and explains why mutation of Tyr 343, but not Tyr 338 or Tyr 342, results in a dramatic change in the binding between NPM-ALK and SHP1.  We then asked if the loss of SHP1 binding can be seen in mutations outside the KAL of ALK. Because our recent mass spectrometry studies revealed only 11 tyrosine residues (including the three in the KAL of ALK) that are phosphorylated (25), we performed site-directed mutagenesis of each of the remaining 8 tyrosine residues outside the KAL, including Tyr 138, Tyr 152, Tyr 156, Tyr 191, Tyr 419, Tyr 567, Tyr 644, and Tyr 664. Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that mutations of all of these 8 tyrosine residues resulted in readily detectable binding between NPM-ALK and SHP1 (Fig. 3a), and these findings are in sharp contrast with that for the Tyr 343 mutant (Fig. 2). We also examined one randomly chosen tyrosine residue of NPM-ALK that is not involved in the phosphorylation, namely Tyr 67; no loss of SHP1 binding was detected (Fig. 3b).  Because we identified Tyr 343 of NPM-ALK as the crucial binding site for SHP1, we then asked if the SHP1-mediated tyrosine dephosphorylation of NPM-ALK is dependent on their physical interaction. A dependence on the physical interaction suggests that SHP1 directly dephosphorylates NPM-ALK. On the other hand, an independence could suggest that SHP1 dephosphorylates NPM-ALK indirectly (i.e. involves another mediator). As shown in Fig. 4a, the expression of SHP1 and NPM-ALK resulted in a 50% reduction of the tyrosine phosphorylation level of NPM-ALK. This level of tyrosine dephosphorylation induced by SHP1 is similar to that seen previously (14, 35). In contrast, SHP1 did not result in any detectable change in the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the Tyr 343 mutant (Fig. 4b). We repeated similar experiments using other NPM-ALK mutants, including (i) the Tyr 644 mutant, which is known to be phosphorylated and resides outside the KAL; and (ii) the Tyr 342 mutant, which is known to be phosphorylated and resides in the KAL. As shown in Fig. 4, c and d, SHP1 dephosphorylated these mutants as effectively as it did for NPM-ALK.  As shown in Fig. 5, in GP293 cells co-transfected with SHP1 and NPM-ALK, SHP1 co-immunoprecipitated with NPM-ALK (lane 2). In contrast, as shown in lanes 3-5, all three SHP1 mutants (i.e. with mutations in the N-SH2 domain, the C-SH2 domains, or both the N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains) had reduced binding to NPM-ALK. Thus, it is evident that both the N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains of SHP1 are important in mediating its binding to NPM-ALK. Reciprocal experiments using anti-ALK antibody for immunoprecipitation yielded similar conclusions regarding the importance of N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains of SHP1 in mediating the interaction between these two proteins (data not shown). Using the same experimental approach, we assessed whether the tyrosine phosphatase activity of SHP1 is important for the SHP1/NPM-ALK binding. As shown in Fig. 6, NPM-ALK co-immunoprecipitated with the SHP1 C445S mutant (lane 3), previously reported to be \u00a1\u00b0phosphatase-dead\u00a1\u00b1 (28).  We then asked if mutations of the SH2 domain of SHP1 also affect its ability to dephosphorylate NPM-ALK. To address this question, we transfected SHP1 or its double SH2 mutant into Karpas 299 cells, a SHP1-negative ALK +ALCL cell line (14). As shown in Fig. 7, mutations of both N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains of SHP1 resulted in a partial decrease in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of NPM-ALK, as compared with the parental SHP1 construct. This partial decrease was expected, as mutation of the SH2 domain of SHP1 did not completely abrogate the SHP1/NPM-ALK binding (Fig. 5).  Using a soft agar clonogenic assay, we assessed how the physical interaction between SHP1 and NPM-ALK affects NPM-ALK-driven tumorigenicity. As shown in Fig. 8, the tumorigenicity of NPM-ALK in cells co-expressing SHP1 was significantly less than that seen in cells co-expressing an empty vector (p value = 0.0032, Student's t test). In contrast, there was no significant difference between tumorigenicity of the Y343F mutant in cells coexpressing either empty vector or SHP1 (p > 0.05, Student's t test). DISCUSSION. In normal cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation status of various proteins is tightly regulated by interaction of a host of kinases and phosphatases (36, 37). SHP1, a cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase largely expressed in hematopoietic cells, is known to dephosphorylate and inhibit various proteins including cytokine receptors (38,?42) as well as cell-surface receptors involved in immune response (43,?47). By virtue of the two SH2 domains, SHP1 physically interacts with specific phosphotyrosine residues in its substrates. Upon binding to these substrates, SHP1 undergoes intramolecular changes that set its tyrosine phosphatase domain free from the hindering effects of its N-SH2 domain (48). The \u00a1\u00b0exposed\u00a1\u00b1 tyrosine phosphatase domain is able to dephosphorylate the substrates and thereby down-regulate their activities. Reduction or loss of SHP1 expression has been found in a number of hematopoietic neoplasms (12, 20, 49,?51). This loss of expression can be attributed to gene methylation, and restoration of SHP1 expression by 5-azathioprine has been shown in a number of hematopoietic cell lines (35, 50). In ALK +ALCL, the loss of SHP1 expression can be identified in up to 80% of these tumors, and this finding correlates with gene methylation of SHP1 (12). Its tumor suppressor function and inhibitory effects on NPM-ALK in these tumors have also been shown previously. Specifically, gene transfection of SHP1 down-regulated the activation/phosphorylation level of NPM-ALK and inhibits its cell growth-promoting effects (14, 21, 35). Although the molecular events underlying the interactions between SHP1 and various substrates in normal cells have been extensively studied, how SHP1 binds and regulates oncogenic tyrosine kinases is incompletely understood. To our knowledge, there are only 3 published studies in which the physical and/or functional interactions between SHP1 and different oncogenic tyrosine kinases were examined (52,?54). In the first study, Lim et al. (52) examined the effect of SHP1 on BCR-ABL and concluded that the physical binding between SHP1 and BCR-ABL is important for down-regulating the phosphorylation level and tumorigenicity of BCR-ABL. In contrast with our study, this study employed an artificially created fusion protein containing the catalytic domain of SHP1 and the ABL binding domain of RIN1 (a known binding partner of c-ABL). Thus, whether the SH2 domains of SHP1 are required for this physical interaction could not be determined. In addition, the tyrosine residue(s) of BCR-ABL involved in this interaction was not determined. In the second study, Hennige et al. (53) examined the inhibitory effect of SHP1 on Ret, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase expressed in medullary thyroid carcinoma. Although it is nicely demonstrated that SHP1 reduces the phosphorylation status of Ret and its oncogenic activity, details of the physical interaction of these two proteins and the importance of this interaction were not examined. Finally, Roccato et al. (54) identified the site of interaction between SHP1 and TRK-T3 (an oncogenic tyrosine kinase characteristic for papillary thyroid tumors) although the functional significance of the physical interaction between these two proteins was not addressed. The requirement for both SH2 domains of SHP1 for its optimal interaction with NPM-ALK is in contrast with the previous finding that only the C-SH2 domain is important for mediating the physical interaction between SHP1 and Fc\u00a5\u00e3RIIb1 (43). Nevertheless, the requirement for both SH2 domains of SHP1 has been described for the SHP1-epidermal growth factor receptor interaction (27). Thus, the relative roles of N-SH2 and C-SH2 of SHP1 appear to vary among different substrates. Because mutations of both SH2 domains of SHP1 did not completely abrogate its binding to NPM-ALK, it is likely that other portions of SHP1 may contribute to the binding. In this regard, it has been previously reported that SHP1 binds the insulin receptor via a unique sequence located in the C-terminal tail of SHP1 (55). Because ALK is a member of the insulin receptor subfamily, this portion of SHP1 may also contribute to the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding. A recent study from our laboratory revealed that only 11 tyrosine residues in NPM-ALK are phosphorylated (25). Three of these 11 tyrosine residues are found in the KAL (Tyr 338, Tyr 342, and Tyr 343). The other eight tyrosine residues were found to be confined to the ALK portion of the fusion protein, and they include Tyr 138, Tyr 152, Tyr 191, Tyr 156, Tyr 419, Tyr 567, Tyr 644, and Tyr 664. In the same study, we found that mutation of any of the three tyrosine residues in the KAL did not affect the phosphorylation status of the remaining two tyrosine residues. Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern outside the KAL is identical between the Tyr 338 mutant and the Tyr 343 mutant. These findings are relevant to this study, because we can conclude that, as compared with the Tyr 338 mutant, the dramatic loss of SHP1 binding seen in the Tyr 343 mutant is not because of a loss of phosphorylation in any tyrosine residue other than Tyr 343 itself. Because Tyr 343 is located in the KAL of ALK, one may have to consider the possibility that this loss of SHP1/NPM-ALK binding is related to the loss of the overall activity of NPM-ALK. We consider this possibility to be unlikely, because the Tyr 338 or Tyr 342 mutants, both of which have been shown to have significantly lower tumorigenicity than the Tyr 343 mutant (25), did not show a substantial loss of SHP1 binding. To further show that Tyr 343 is the specific binding site of SHP1, we found no substantial loss of SHP1 binding when we introduced mutations of each of the remaining 8 different tyrosine residues known to be involved in the phosphorylation of NPM-ALK. Of note, because the enzymatically inactive NPM-ALK K210R mutant resulted in abrogation of the SHP1/NPM-ALK binding, some degree of (but not full) phosphorylation and activation of NPM-ALK is required for its physical interaction with SHP1. The requirement for at least some degree of tyrosine phosphorylation is in keeping with the observation that SHP1 generally binds only the phosphorylated substrates (16). Based on the presented data, we have developed a hypothetical model to describe the SHP1/NPM-ALK interaction. We speculate that one of the two SH2 domains of SHP1 directly binds Tyr 343 of NPM-ALK, whereas the second SH2 domain of SHP1 is responsible for providing the optimal three-dimensional conformation for this interaction. This second SH2 domain may also interact with another specific tyrosine residue of NPM-ALK, although this interaction by itself is so weak that mutation of this specific tyrosine residue alone did not result in a dramatic effect in our co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This model explains why mutation of either SH2 domain of SHP1 resulted in a reduction in the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding. In conclusion, we identified Tyr 343 of NPM-ALK as the crucial binding site for SHP1. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of SHP1 on NPM-ALK require some degree of (but not full) activation of NPM-ALK. Their physical interaction is also partly dependent on the two SH2 domains of SHP1. Our results support the model that SHP1 exerts its inhibitory effects directly on NPM-ALK. To our knowledge, this is one of the most comprehensive studies of how SHP1 physically and functionally interacts with an oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "CYT387, a novel JAK2 inhibitor, induces hematologic responses and normalizes inflammatory cytokines in murine myeloproliferative neoplasms\tActivating alleles of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) such as JAK2 V617F are central to the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), suggesting that small molecule inhibitors targeting JAK2 may be therapeutically useful. We have identified an aminopyrimidine derivative (CYT387), which inhibits JAK1, JAK2, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) at low nanomolar concentrations, with few additional targets. Between 0.5 and 1.5\u00a5\u00ecM CYT387 caused growth suppression and apoptosis in JAK2-dependent hematopoietic cell lines, while nonhematopoietic cell lines were unaffected. In a murine MPN model, CYT387 normalized white cell counts, hematocrit, spleen size, and restored physiologic levels of inflammatory cytokines. Despite the hematologic responses and reduction of the JAK2 V617F allele burden, JAK2 V617F cells persisted and MPN recurred upon cessation of treatment, suggesting that JAK2 inhibitors may be unable to eliminate JAK2 V617F cells, consistent with preliminary results from clinical trials of JAK2 inhibitors in myelofibrosis. While the clinical benefit of JAK2 inhibitors may be substantial, not the least due to reduction of inflammatory cytokines and symptomatic improvement, our data add to increasing evidence that kinase inhibitor monotherapy of malignant disease is not curative, suggesting a need for drug combinations to optimally target the malignant cells. Introduction. An activating mutation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2; JAK2 V617F) is present in almost all patients with polycythemia vera (PV), 30% to 50% of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and smaller subsets of patients with other myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). 1?5 JAK2 V617F is thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Consistent with this, a PV-like disease with secondary myelofibrosis arises in mice that received transplants with bone marrow expressing JAK2 V617F, and mice transgenic for JAK2 V617F develop an ET- or PV-like MPN. 6?9 Based on the success of the breakpoint cluster region?Abelson leukemia virus (BCR-ABL) inhibitor, imatinib, for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), there is considerable interest in the development of small molecule JAK2 kinase inhibitors for the treatment of MPN, and several compounds are currently in clinical trials of myelofibrosis. 10?12 Here, we describe the in vitro and in vivo activity of CYT387, a specific small molecule inhibitor of wild-type and V617F mutant JAK2. Methods. Expression vectors. For stable cell lines, the retroviral vector MSCV-IRES-GFP (MIG) was used containing wild-type or V617F alleles of murine JAK2 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr James Ihle, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) or the murine erythropoietin receptor (EPOR; kindly provided by Dr Dwayne Barber, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, ON). Retrovirus production, cell culture, and immunoblotting. Retrovirus production, cell culture, and immunoblotting were performed as described. 6 For details, see supplemental Methods (available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). Mutagenesis screen. The selection for CYT387-resistant clones was performed as described. 13 Details are provided in supplemental Methods. Kinase assays. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)?tagged JAK kinase domains were cloned in gateway baculovirus vectors (Invitrogen) and expressed in SF9 insect cells. The fusion proteins were purified and used in a peptide substrate phosphorylation assay. Assays were performed in 384-well Optiplates using an Alphascreen Protein Tyrosine Kinase P100 detection kit (PerkinElmer) and a PerkinElmer Fusion Alpha instrument. Bone marrow transplantation. Standard techniques were used. All mouse work was performed with approval from the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For details, see supplemental Methods. CYT387 administration. On day 32 after bone marrow transplantation (when all mice exhibited severe leukocytosis and erythrocytosis), mice were assigned to 3 groups such that each group had equivalent average body weight and blood counts (see Figure 2, supplemental Figure 2A). CYT387 was dissolved in NMP (120 mg/mL final; 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, Chromasolv Plus; Sigma-Aldrich). Subsequently, the CYT387/NMP mix was diluted with 0.14M Captisol (Cydex Pharmaceuticals Inc) to a concentration of 6 mg/mL and further diluted with 0.1M Captisol to a final concentration of 4 mg/mL. All 3 groups of mice (n = 12 per group) were administered CYT387 by oral gavage twice daily at 10- to 12-hour intervals from day 34 after bone marrow transplantation to day 82 (end of experiment). Mice received NMP/Captisol without CYT387 (0 mg/kg group), 25 mg/kg CYT387, or 50 mg/kg CYT387. At day 82 after bone marrow transplantation, all mice were euthanized for analysis except for 2 mice each from the 50 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg groups, which were taken off CYT387 treatment and followed for 45 additional days. For assessment of the effects of CYT387 on normal blood counts, naive Balb/c mice were administered vehicle control, 50 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg CYT387 in an identical fashion as described for the bone marrow transplant experimental mouse cohort. Peripheral blood was drawn at day 14, 28, 42, and 56 and levels of red cells, white cells, reticulocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes were analyzed. Pathologic examination. Blood was collected from anesthetized mice by lethal inferior vena cava bleeding. Blood was incubated at 5\u00a1\u00c6C for 2 hours, centrifuged at 2000 rcf for 10 minutes, and serum was stored at ?80\u00a1\u00c6C. Organs were dissected and white blood cells from spleen and bone marrow were harvested by passing through a 70-\u00a5\u00ecm nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences), followed by red cell lysis. Histologic analysis. Samples from liver, spleen, and humerus were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde (Protocol) and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 \u00a5\u00ecm were stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E). Decalcified sections of humerus were stained with H&E and reticulin stain (American Master*Tech Scientific Inc). Reticulin-stained humerus sections were scored in a blinded fashion on a scale of 0 to 3 for degree of fibrosis with 0 indicating normal tissue and 3 indicating extreme fibrosis. 14 Flow cytometry. White cells from bone marrow and spleen were stained with conjugated monoclonal antibodies as described. 6 Quantitative PCR for GFP (allele) burden. Genomic DNA was isolated from mouse splenocytes or Ba/F3 cells and standardized to 10 ng/\u00a5\u00ecL. DNA was amplified with Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) on an MJ Research Opticon 2 thermal cycler using primers specific for green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the genomic mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) locus: GFP forward (F): 5\u00a1\u00c7-ACGTAAACGGCCACAAGTTC-3\u00a1\u00c7; GFP reverse (R): 5\u00a1\u00c7-AAGTCGTGCTGCTTCATGTG-3\u00a1\u00c7; GAPDH F: 5\u00a1\u00c7-AGCCTTAAAAGCCCTTGAGC-3\u00a1\u00c7; GAPDH R: 5\u00a1\u00c7-CTATAGGGCCTGGGTCAGTG-3\u00a1\u00c7. On each plate, a standard curve of Ba/F3 cell genomic DNA was included that comprised 100%, 50%, 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.1%, and 0% JAK2 V617F-GFP + cells with the remainder of the cells being parental Ba/F3 (GFP ?). The difference in cycle number between GFP and GAPDH (\u00a5\u00c4 cycle threshold [\u00a5\u00c4Ct]) was determined for each sample. Subsequently, the difference between the \u00a5\u00c4Ct of each well compared with the highest GFP value on the standard curve was calculated (\u00a5\u00c4\u00a5\u00c4Ct). The percent GFP by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was expressed as 2 ?\u00a5\u00c4\u00a5\u00c4Ct \u00a1\u00bf 100, such that the well with highest GFP value on the standard curve is set at 100% and all other wells are expressed relative to that point. Quantification of cytokines. Serum levels of 32 different cytokines were measured using a bead-based immunofluorescence assay (Luminex Inc), following the instructions of the manufacturer. CYT387 pharmacokinetics. CYT387 (25 and 50 mg/kg) was administered to Balb/c mice as described under \u00a1\u00b0CYT387 administration.\u00a1\u00b1 Groups of 4 mice were sacrificed after 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 hours and plasma was collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. CYT387 plasma concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS)/MS analysis of samples, referenced to an internal standard, using an Agilent liquid chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc) and an API3000 (triple-quadrupole) instrument from Applied Biosystems Inc with an electrospray ionization interface. Plasma samples (50.0 \u00a5\u00ecL) were mixed with 10 \u00a5\u00ecL of methanol and 250 \u00a5\u00ecL of internal standard solution (100 ng/mL). After vortexing for 1 minute and centrifuging for 5 minutes at 15 000 rpm, 100-\u00a5\u00ecL supernatants were analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Statistics. The SPSS statistics package was used for all statistical analyses. Continuous variables were compared by pairwise t test for 2 independent samples. Nonlinear regression was used to determine a best-fit curve for the GFP qPCR standard curve and generate an r 2 value. Results. Profiling of a JAK2 inhibitor. CYT387 was discovered by high-throughput enzyme and cell-based screening of small molecule libraries, with subsequent optimization of the lead compounds using structure-guided medicinal chemistry (Figure 1A). Details of the identification process and the results of x-ray diffraction analysis of CYT387 in complex with the kinase domain of JAK2 will be published in a separate manuscript. In vitro kinase assays performed in the presence of 80\u00a5\u00ecM adenosine triphosphate (ATP) revealed that CYT387 inhibited the activity of recombinant JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) kinase domains with 50% inhibition/inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of 11, 18, 155, and 17nM, respectively. To globally evaluate specificity, we tested CYT387 against a panel of 128 kinases, using the SelectScreen Profiling Service (Invitrogen). Significant activity (defined as an IC 50 < 100nM) was detected against CDK2/cyclin A, MAPK8 (JNK1), PRKCN (PKD3), PRKD1 (PKC\u00a5\u00ec), ROCK2, and TBK1 (supplemental Table 1). CYT387 selectively inhibits JAK2-dependent cell lines. We assessed the effects of graded CYT387 concentrations on a panel of cell lines, including hematopoietic lines transformed to growth factor independence by expression of JAK2 V617F, HEL cells with naturally acquired JAK2 V617F, and a variety of other leukemia and cancer cell lines (Table 1). Three groups of cell lines could be distinguished according to IC 50 values and involvement of JAK2 in their survival signaling. The first group is entirely composed of cell lines known to be dependent on JAK2 signaling for viability and proliferation. This group encompasses Ba/F3 and 32D cells engineered to express JAK2 V617F together with the EPOR, the parental lines transduced with empty vector or EPOR alone (which remain dependent on interleukin-3 [IL-3] or EPO), HEL cells, TF-1 cells (GM-CSF?dependent) and U266 myeloma cells (dependent on an autocrine IL-6 loop). 15 The IC 50 in these lines ranged between 500 and 1500nM. Although Ba/F3 cells expressing both JAK2 V617F and EPOR were slightly more sensitive to CYT387 than parental controls (Figure 1B), sensitivity was not consistently higher in cells dependent on JAK2 V617F versus wild-type JAK2. For a second group of cell lines, survival has not directly been linked to JAK2 signaling. Significant growth inhibition was observed in Molm14 cells, which carry an internal tandem duplication of FLT3. Furthermore, significant inhibition was observed in cell lines engineered to express BCR-ABL (Mo7e-p210 BCR-ABL, Ba/F3-p210 BCR-ABL-T315I, 32D-p210 BCR-ABL, 32D-p190 BCR-ABL). CMK cells, which are dependent on both JAK1 and JAK3 due to an activating mutation of JAK3 (JAK3 A572V) that signals through wild-type JAK1, 16 were also sensitive to CYT387. A third group of cell lines demonstrated higher IC 50 values, in most cases exceeding 5000nM (the maximum concentration tested). This group encompasses all 4 nonhematopoietic cell lines tested. In aggregate, these data are consistent with relatively selective growth inhibition of JAK2 and possibly JAK1/TYK2-dependent cell lines. To assess whether CYT387 induces apoptosis in some of these JAK2-dependent cell lines, we performed trypan blue exclusion in conjunction with immunoblot for cleaved caspase 3 and found a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis (Figure 1C). CYT387 inhibits JAK2 activity and signaling. To determine whether effects of CYT387 on proliferation and apoptosis correlate with inhibition of JAK2 signaling, we exposed Ba/F3 cells expressing JAK2 V617F and EPOR to graded concentrations of CYT387 for 16 hours and analyzed phosphorylation of JAK2 signaling components by immunoblot (Figure 1D). While a significant reduction of phospho-JAK2 was evident only at relatively high concentrations of CYT387 (> 2\u00a5\u00ecM), phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) was inhibited at 0.3\u00a5\u00ecM CYT387 and above. CYT387 is effective in a murine model of MPNs. We next tested whether CYT387 is efficacious in an in vivo model of JAK2 V617F-dependent MPN in which lethally irradiated Balb/c mice are transplanted with bone marrow transduced with a JAK2 V617F retrovirus. 6 Initially, we assessed the overall impact of this compound on the homeostasis of blood cells in naive mice. We found that CYT387 at twice the dose used in our subsequent disease model (50 and 100 mg/kg) had little to no effect on peripheral blood counts (supplemental Figure 1) over a period of 8 weeks. Next, we determined the plasma concentrations of CYT387 in Balb/c mice after a single dose of 25 and 50 mg/kg CYT387, the doses anticipated for use in our in vivo model. Median plasma peak concentrations were 7.1\u00a5\u00ecM with the lower dose and 32.1\u00a5\u00ecM with the higher dose, with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. Trough levels at 12 hours were 10nM for the 25 mg/kg and 900nM for the 50 mg/kg dose (Figure 2A, supplemental Table 2). In our murine MPN model, the animals develop PV-like MPN, with neutrophilic leukocytosis, erythrocytosis, and secondary myelofibrosis (Figure 2B-E). At day 34 after transplantation, the mean white blood cell counts and hematocrit values of the entire cohort exceeded the normal range for Balb/c mice by more than 1 SD. At this point, 6 mice were sacrificed and subjected to autopsy. In the remaining animals, treatment was initiated with 25 mg/kg CYT387, 50 mg/kg CYT387, or vehicle, administered twice daily by oral gavage (12 mice per treatment group). A rapid drop of the white cell counts was apparent in both dose cohorts as early as 6 days after initiation of treatment (Figure 2B) and a decline of the hematocrit was apparent after 20 days (Figure 2C). Complete normalization of hematocrit was achieved in the high-dose group, while slightly elevated values persisted in the low-dose group (Figure 2C). The drop in white blood cell counts was accompanied by a relative decrease in the granulocyte population and an increase to normal range of the lymphocyte cell population (Figure 2D-E, supplemental Figure 2C-D). In one single mouse in the high-dose group, both white blood cell count and hematocrit remained consistently above the normal range (data not shown). Thrombocytosis is not a feature of the murine MPN model used here, and platelet counts remained stable throughout the observation period (data not shown). No change in body weight was recorded in any of the 3 groups (supplemental Figure 2). In 4 mice (2 each in the low-dose and high-dose group), treatment was stopped on day 83 after transplantation. Repeat blood counts showed a recurrence of the elevated hematocrit in all mice and a recurrence of the elevated white blood cell counts in the 2 mice previously treated with 50 mg/kg CYT387 (supplemental Figure 3). At day 83 after bone marrow transplantation, all mice were subjected to autopsy (with the exception of the 2 low-dose and 2 high-dose mice that were monitored after drug discontinuation). Our previous analysis of 6 mice at the start of CYT387 treatment (day 34 after bone marrow transplantation) had revealed that all 6 mice exhibited enlarged spleens compared with naive mice (Figure 2F). Mice that were subsequently treated with vehicle and sacrificed at day 83 after transplantation demonstrated gross splenomegaly, which had increased compared with the mice analyzed before therapy (Figure 2F). Spleen size was significantly reduced in both the 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg groups compared with vehicle mice. In the 50 mg/kg treatment group, spleen weights were not significantly different from weights of naive, age-matched controls. Liver weights were not significantly different among the cohorts of mice (data not shown). There was no macroscopic evidence for organ involvement other than spleen as assessed by examination of liver, lung, and kidney. Staining of peripheral blood smears showed increased red blood cells and reticulocytes in the vehicle-treated controls. A significant reduction of reticulocytes in the low-dose (P = .007) and high-dose (P = .020) groups was observed compared with vehicle control (Figure 3A, supplemental Figure 2B). Histology of spleens from mice in the vehicle group showed extensive infiltration with extramedullary hematopoiesis and complete effacement of splenic architecture. Findings in mice from the low-dose group were similar, while there was partial restoration of splenic architecture in the high-dose group with intact follicles covering 30% to 50% of the area (Figure 3B). Liver histology revealed mild infiltration with extramedullary hematopoiesis, ranging from small periportal aggregates and scattered megakaryocytes to large perivascular and random aggregates of maturing granulocytes in vehicle and low-dose groups, but not in the high-dose group (Figure 3C). In all 3 groups, bone marrow histology was hypercellular with marked right-shifted granulocytic hyperplasia. Megakaryocytes were dysplastic in all samples with increases in cell and nuclear size and abnormal nuclear lobation and appeared to be substantially increased in the 50 mg/kg group (Figure 3D). Reticulin fibrosis was significantly reduced in high-dose?treated mice compared with the vehicle controls as determined by a blinded 0 to 3 scoring of femoral tissue sections of 6 animals from each group where 0 indicates normal tissue and 3 indicates extreme levels of fibrosis. The vehicle-control mice exhibited an average score of 1.5, while the 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg mouse group scores were reduced to an average of 1.0 and 0.5, respectively (Figure 3E, supplemental Table 3). CYT387 restores hematopoietic lineage composition, but JAK2 V617F-expressing cells persist. To determine the effects of CYT387 on the various hematopoietic cell compartments and differentiation stages, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of bone marrow and spleen cells (Figure 4, supplemental Figure 4, and supplemental Table 4). CYT387 therapy induced a decrease in granulocytes (Gr1 +) compared with vehicle-treated mice (Figure 4A), both in spleen (high-dose only) and bone marrow, which was accompanied by an increase of T cells (CD3 +) and B cells (CD19 +/B220 +; Figure 4B). Cells of the erythroid lineage showed divergent behavior between spleen and marrow. Splenic early erythrocyte progenitors (CD71 +) were significantly reduced in treated mice compared with vehicle-control mice, while mature erythrocyte progenitors (Ter119 +) were reduced to a lesser extent. In contrast, both populations increased in the marrows of mice treated with 50 mg/kg (but not 25 mg/kg) CYT387 (Figure 4C). Similarly, we saw a relative reduction of splenic lineage-negative (Lin-neg) KIT +/CD34 + cells (representing progenitor cells) and Lin-neg KIT +/CD34 ? cells (containing hematopoietic stem cells and early progenitors) in the 50 mg/kg group versus vehicle-control group while both of these populations were increased in the marrow (Figure 4D). Megakaryocytic lineage cells (CD41 +) were increased in spleen as well as bone marrow of treated mice (Figure 4E). Unexpectedly, flow cytometric analysis revealed minimal expression of GFP (< 1% in many cell compartments; data not shown). As previous studies have shown that the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)?GFP component of this transgene can become silenced and cells subsequently lose GFP expression, 17 we developed a new qPCR assay for quantification of GFP (and thus allele burden) in genomic DNA of cells, using amplification of the genomic GAPDH locus for normalization. In multiple independently performed amplifications, using genomic DNA from a standard dilution of graded ratios of parental (GFP-negative) and JAK2 V614F/GFP-positive Ba/F3 cells, we were able to demonstrate that this assay accurately quantifies GFP genomic DNA over a wide range (0.1%-100% GFP-positive cells) with an r 2 value of 0.9999 (Figure 5A). Application of this technique on splenic genomic DNA isolated from mice treated with vehicle or CYT387 showed a high overall level of GFP with a range of 23% to 90% (Figure 5B). Interestingly, we observed a significant reduction in GFP levels (allelic burden) in mice treated with 50 mg/kg CYT387 (Figure 5C). These observations suggest that JAK2 inhibitor therapy results in a selective reduction of JAK2 V617-expressing cells. However, even the high dose of CYT387 failed to eliminate the JAK2 V617F/GFP-positive population, consistent with persistence of MPN. Similar observations have been made in early clinical trials with JAK2 inhibitors in myelofibrosis. 18 Effects of CYT387 on plasma cytokines. Patients with myelofibrosis exhibit increased plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, which are thought to be responsible for the constitutional symptoms that characterize the disease. 19 We therefore hypothesized that responses to CYT387 may be associated with a normalization of abnormal cytokine expression. At the termination of the experiment, we collected plasma from the 2 CYT387 treatment groups, vehicle-treated controls (0 mg/kg) and untreated sex- and age-matched normal mice and measured the expression of a panel of 32 different cytokines and chemokines using a multiplex assay (supplemental Table 5). We found that the plasma levels of 13 pivotal inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, IL-1\u00a5\u00e2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-17, IP-10, LIF, MCP-1, MIG, VEGF, TNF-\u00a5\u00e1, and IFN-\u00a5\u00e3, were elevated in vehicle-treated MPN mice compared with normal naive mice (P \u00a1\u00c2 .1). Most of these cytokines and chemokines showed a dose-dependent reduction in mice treated with CYT387 to normal or almost normal levels, although to a variable degree. For example, the concentrations of IFN-\u00a5\u00e3, IL-3, VEGF, IL-17, IL-9, LIF, and IL-1\u00a5\u00e2 were identical or almost identical in mice treated with 50 mg/kg CYT387 and normal mice (Figure 6A-B). In contrast, the concentrations of TNF-\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure 6C), IL-6 (Figure 6D), IL-10, IP-10, KC, and MCP-1 (supplemental Table 5) remained elevated compared with normal mice. By contrast, 3 cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-12p40, and IL-1\u00a5\u00e1) were significantly reduced in vehicle-treated diseased mice compared with normal naive mice (supplemental Table 5). All 3 cytokines returned back to normal plasma levels with CYT387 treatment (supplemental Table 5). Interestingly, IL-10 and G-CSF concentrations were similar in vehicle-treated diseased mice compared with normal naive mice. However, IL-10 was significantly down-regulated with CYT387 treatment (Figure 6E) and G-CSF was significantly up-regulated compared with normal naive mice upon treatment with CYT387 (Figure 6F). Altogether, these data indicate that mice with JAK2 V617F-induced disease exhibit a complex perturbation of cytokine and chemokine expression that is at least partially normalized by CYT387. In vitro resistance to CYT387 by overexpression of JAK2 V617F. Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib or dasatinib in CML, or gefitinib in non?small cell lung cancer is frequently due to acquired point mutations in the kinase domain of the target kinases. 20,21 We have previously shown that resistance mutations in BCR-ABL are readily induced and selected by culture of ENU-treated Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL in the presence of inhibitors. 13 To determine whether point mutations in the JAK2 kinase domain can confer resistance to CYT387, we treated Ba/F3-EPOR cells expressing JAK2 V617F with ENU, followed by culture in the presence of 2 to 5\u00a5\u00ecM CYT387. Cell clones emerged that were resistant to CYT387 up to a concentration of 4\u00a5\u00ecM. Sequence analysis of the entire exogenous JAK2 DNA failed to reveal any mutations in over 200 single clones (data not shown). These data suggest that point mutations are an unlikely mechanism of clinical resistance to CYT387. Consistent with this, sequencing of spleen DNA from 1 mouse in the high-dose treatment group that failed to normalize the hematocrit showed only wild-type sequence (data not shown). However, 7 resistant cell clones derived from the 4-\u00a5\u00ecM cultures expressed 2- to 6-fold higher levels of the JAK2 protein compared with the parental cells, with even greater differences in pJAK2 (Figure 7A-B). To investigate the possibility that this elevated expression of JAK2 may be due to selection for cells with extra copies of the JAK2 V617F-IRES-GFP transgene, we applied our GFP qPCR technique to assess levels of GFP in the genomic DNA from these cells relative to a standard curve of Ba/F3 cells with a maximum of 100% (1 copy of the transgene). We investigated 6 of the 7 CYT387-resistant clones and found that 4 of 6 clones had levels of GFP equivalent to the top point on the curve (1 copy of the transgene), 1 of 6 clones exhibited 2-fold higher levels than the top point on the standard curve (2 copies of the transgene), and 1 of 6 clones exhibited GFP levels 3-fold of the top of the standard curve (3 copies of the transgene; Figure 7C). However, there was no correlation between the transgene copy number and the JAK2 protein expression. For example, the clone with 3 copies of the transgene did not exhibit the highest JAK2 expression. Hence, while one mechanism for increased JAK2 expression in this model may be selection for cells with extra JAK2 V617F copies, this is not a consistent finding and additional mechanisms must govern JAK2 overexpression in this model system. Discussion. More than 90% of patients with PV and 30% to 50% of patients with PMF and ET carry the JAK2 V617F allele. 22 Additional patients have activating mutations in exon 12 of JAK2 or in upstream signaling pathways, such as the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL), suggesting that JAK2 activation may be a universal feature of MPN, and as yet unknown mechanisms may be causal in patients without mutations in JAK2 or MPL. 23,24 Given the efficacy of BCR-ABL inhibitors such as imatinib in patients with CML, there is considerable interest in the development of JAK2 inhibitors for the treatment of patients with MPN. Here, we characterized CYT387, a novel aminopyrimidine inhibitor of JAK2 in a murine model of JAK2 V617F-driven MPN. In vitro kinase assays revealed CYT387 as a low nanomolar inhibitor of JAK2 JAK1, and TYK2, with very limited off-target effects (supplemental Table 1). Proliferation of JAK2 V617F cell lines was inhibited by CYT387, with IC 50 values ranging between 500 and 1500nM (Figure 2A, Table 1), and this correlated with inhibition of downstream signaling (Figure 2C) and induction of apoptosis (Figure 2B). The differential (\u00a1\u00ad 1.5-log) between the sensitivity in enzyme and cell proliferation assays presumably arises from the different concentrations of ATP in biochemical assays (typically 100\u00a5\u00ecM or less) and cellular assays (> 1mM), though may also be related to drug transport mechanisms or protein binding. Ba/F3 cells expressing JAK2 V617F and EPOR were slightly more sensitive to CYT387 than cells expressing EPOR alone (Figure 2A), but in general all cell lines dependent on JAK2 signaling were inhibited at CYT387 concentrations between 500 and 1500nM. Inhibition of JAK1 is the most likely explanation for the low IC 50 in CMK cells, which express an activated JAK3 allele that is dependent on wild-type JAK1 for downstream signaling, 16 whereas the growth inhibition of Molm14 cells (FLT3-ITD positive) remains mechanistically unexplained. Since the SelectScreen Profiling Service (Invitrogen) revealed the IC 50 of CYT387 for the FLT3 kinase domain to be 200nM, it is unclear whether this effect on Molm14 cells is due to an off-target, direct effect of the inhibitor on FLT3 kinase, or whether this may indicate involvement of JAK2 family members in signaling downstream of FLT3-ITD, although a previous study found no evidence for this. 25 In contrast, the IC 50 values for BCR-ABL?expressing cell lines were in a range from 1.5 to 5\u00a5\u00ecM. This may be explained by the fact that JAK2 is involved in signal transduction downstream of BCR-ABL. 26 Since the SelectScreen Profiling Service (Invitrogen) showed an IC 50 for ABL to be greater than 5000nM, this explanation of BCR-ABL signaling through JAK2 is a more likely explanation than direct effects of the inhibitor on BCR-ABL. Lastly, nonhematopoietic cell lines showed no significant inhibition at the highest concentration tested (5 \u00a5\u00ecM). Together, these data show that CYT387 selectively inhibits the proliferation of JAK2 and possibly JAK1/TYK2-dependent cell lines, irrespective of whether they express wild-type or mutant JAK2. Inhibition of STAT5 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurred at lower concentrations than of JAK2. This is presumably due to the binding of CYT387 to an open-phosphorylated form of JAK2 (C.J.B., E.F., manuscript in preparation). The competitive inhibition of ATP binding consequently blocks phosphorylation of multiple copies of STAT3 and ERK proteins, because JAK2 is a catalytic initiator of these signaling pathways. CYT387 showed in vivo activity in a murine MPN model, with normalization of white blood cell counts, white cell differential counts and hematocrit in mice treated with 50 mg/kg CYT387 (Figure 3). As expected, effects on the hematocrit were apparent only after several weeks, reflecting the 23-day half-life of erythrocytes in Balb/c mice. 27 Reticulocytes were reduced, however, elevated counts persisted despite CYT387 treatment. On autopsy, mice in the 50 mg/kg group showed almost normal spleen weight and greatly reduced extramedullary hematopoiesis, with a partial restoration of normal splenic architecture. In contrast, the effects of CYT387 on the bone marrow were less pronounced, with persistent hypercellularity even in the 50 mg/kg group. FACS analysis of spleen and bone marrow according to hematopoietic lineage revealed differential effects. The decrease of Gr1 + cells in spleen and bone marrow, the most dominant cell population in these organs (Figure 5A), was in line with the observed decrease of granulocytes in the peripheral blood of CYT387-treated mice (Figure 3D). The relative increase of lymphoid cells (CD3 + and CD19 +/B220 +) in spleen and bone marrow of CYT387-treated mice is in line with the observed increase of intact lymphoid follicles (Figure 4B) and the increase of lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood of CYT387-treated mice (Figure 3E). The increase of the CD41 + cells (megakaryocytic lineage; Figure 5E), especially in the high-dose 50 mg/kg group, is supported by the histologic finding of increased megakaryocytes in the marrow of 50 mg/kg mice (Figure 4D) and likely represents a relative increase due to an overall decrease in the cellularity of the bone marrow and spleen. An additional level of complexity is added by the profound effects of CYT387 on the levels of inflammatory and hematopoietic cytokines, which may differentially affect JAK2 WT versus JAK2 V617F cells. For example, TNF-\u00a5\u00e1 is a negative regulator of erythropoiesis and the reduction of TNF-\u00a5\u00e1 in CYT387-treated mice may contribute to the relative increase of erythropoietic cells in the bone marrow of these mice, 28 as observed by the increase of both early (CD71 +) and late (Ter119 +) erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow (of mice; Figure 5C). Despite the profound reduction of overall cell numbers, evidenced by the normalization of blood counts and spleen size, the persistence of GFP in the splenic DNA clearly shows that CYT387 fails to eliminate JAK2 V617F-expressing cells. Several explanations exist for this observation. First, while high peak levels are achieved, the drug half-life in mice is short, which is insufficient for continuously maintaining plasma concentrations above the IC 50, even with the 50 mg/kg dose (Figure 3A). This may be sufficient for inhibition of proliferation, but insufficient for induction of apoptosis. Second, microenvironmental JAK2-independent signals may promote survival of JAK2 V617F-expressing cells in the presence of CYT387. A third possibility is that the duration of therapy was insufficient and JAK2 V617F-expressing cells would continue to decrease with extended duration of treatment. Significant in vivo activity has also been observed with TG101348, another small molecule inhibitor of JAK2, in a murine model similar to the model used here as well as in xenografts. 10?12 Because no mice were followed after discontinuation of TG101348, it is unknown whether this compound may induce more durable responses. However, the data from our mouse model are strikingly similar to early reports from studies of JAK2 inhibitors in patients with advanced myelofibrosis. While these drugs induce a rapid reduction of spleen size in practically all patients, there was an equally rapid recurrence of splenomegaly upon interruption of dosing for toxicity. 18 All in all, these observations suggest that JAK2 inhibitors may be incapable of curing MPN, similar to imatinib's inability to eradicate CML. 29 Although this appears to be common to both disease entities, there are also important differences. For example, MPN patients appear to have persistent clonal cells in all stages of maturity in contrast to CML where this is limited to early stem/progenitor cells. It will be interesting to determine the biologic basis for the different responses of these 2 oncogenic tyrosine kinases to kinase inhibitor therapy. Possible mechanisms may include differences in the normal biologic role for these proteins as well as potential differences in the way each oncogene may contribute to malignancy. Nonetheless, the dramatic reduction of splenomegaly and the normalization of cytokine concentrations suggest that CYT387 will be effective in human MPN. Phase 1 clinical trials were expected to begin in early 2010. Moreover, the profound effects of CYT387 on inflammatory cytokines suggest that potent JAK2 inhibitors may have therapeutic benefit in disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, where such cytokines play a major pathogenetic role.

Here we report that Sulindac, an NSAID, induces apoptosis by binding to retinoid X receptor-\u00a5\u00e1 (RXR\u00a5\u00e1). We identified an N-terminally-truncated RXR\u00a5\u00e1 (tRXR\u00a5\u00e1) in several cancer cell lines and primary tumors, which interacted with the p85\u00a5\u00e1 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K). Tumor necrosis factor-\u00a5\u00e1 (TNF\u00a5\u00e1) promoted tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 interaction with the p85\u00a5\u00e1, activating PI3K/AKT signaling. When combined with TNF\u00a5\u00e1, Sulindac inhibited TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced tRXR\u00a5\u00e1/p85\u00a5\u00e1 interaction, leading to activation of the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway. We designed and synthesized a Sulindac analog K-80003, which has increased affinity to RXR\u00a5\u00e1 but lacks COX inhibitory activity. K-80003 displayed enhanced efficacy in inhibiting tRXR\u00a5\u00e1-dependent AKT activation and tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 tumor growth in animals. SIGNIFICANCE. Our results demonstrate that RXR\u00a5\u00e1 mediates NSAID Sulindac-induced apoptosis. We provide evidence that tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 detected in cancer cells acts nongenomically to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway and promote cancer cell growth and survival, which is inhibited by Sulindac. Our finding that Sulindac and TNF\u00a5\u00e1 synergistically induce apoptosis through activation of TNF\u00a5\u00e1-dependent apoptotic pathway offers therapeutic strategies to sensitize cancer cells to the killing effect of this cytokine. Our characterizations of RXR-selective Sulindac-derived analog K-80003 demonstrate that Sulindac\u00a1\u00afs anti-cancer effects can be dissociated from its COX inhibition and identify a RXR\u00a5\u00e1-based lead for cancer therapy. These findings should appeal to a broad audience of clinicians, cancer biologists, molecular biologists and drug designers. Highlights. INTRODUCTION. Sulindac sulfide (Sulindac hereafter) (Haanen, 2001) is one of the early non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) known to inhibit the activities of cyclooxygenases (COXs), of which COX-1 is constitutively expressed whereas COX-2 is induced by mitogenic and inflammatory stimuli. The discovery that regular use of aspirin, an NSAID, reduce the incidence of colon cancer has provided the impetus to develop NSAIDs for cancer prevention and treatment (Grosch et al., 2006; Thun et al., 2002). Sulindac has received extensive attention because of its potent induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cancer cell growth (Haanen, 2001; Yamamoto et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2000). NSAIDs are believed to exert their anti-cancer effects through inhibition of COX-2, which is often overexpressed in human premalignant and malignant tissues and plays a role in carcinogenesis. Compelling evidence however also indicates that NSAIDs can function through COX-2-independent mechanisms (Grosch et al., 2006; Yamamoto et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2000). For example, cells lacking COX-1, COX-2, or both show comparable sensitivity to NSAID-induced apoptosis, whereas NSAIDs that do not inhibit COX-2 also induce apoptosis and inhibit carcinogenesis. Recent evidence that COX-2 inhibition is associated with increased cardiovascular risk (Fitzgerald, 2004) underscores the importance in the identification of non-COX-2 targets, which may lead to strategies for developing improved anti-cancer drugs. Although several non-COX-2 targets for NSAIDs have been reported (Grosch et al., 2006), more efforts to identify additional targets and characterize their mechanism of action are needed in order to develop improved target-based drugs for cancer therapy. Retinoid X receptor-\u00a5\u00e1 (RXR\u00a5\u00e1), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, plays a role in many biological processes including carcinogenesis (Altucci and Gronemeyer, 2001; Dawson and Zhang, 2002). 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), several polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the NSAID Etodolac (Kolluri et al., 2005) can bind to RXR\u00a5\u00e1 to regulate different biological functions. Targretin, a synthetic RXR ligand, is currently used for treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Dawson and Zhang, 2002), demonstrating the suitability of targeting RXR\u00a5\u00e1 for cancer therapy. Consistently, the oncogenic potential of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 has been demonstrated. Genetic disruption of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 enhances tumorigenesis (Huang et al., 2002; Li et al., 2001), and RXR binding to PML/RAR is essential for the development of acute promeylocytic leukemia (Zeisig et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2007). In addition, the RXR\u00a5\u00e1 protein level is often reduced in cancer cells and tumor tissues (Picard et al., 1999; Takiyama et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2003), which is in part due to limited proteolytic processing of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 by calpain or cathepsin (Matsushima-Nishiwaki et al., 1996; Nagaya et al., 1998; Nomura et al., 1999; Takiyama et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2003). However, the biological function of the resulting truncated RXR\u00a5\u00e1 (tRXR\u00a5\u00e1) proteins remains unknown. The mechanisms by which RXR\u00a5\u00e1 regulates diverse biological functions remain to be fully determined and are expected to be complex (Kastner et al., 1995; Mangelsdorf and Evans, 1995). Like other nuclear receptors, RXR\u00a5\u00e1 is known to regulate the transcription of target genes by binding to DNA response elements. Accumulating evidence however indicates that RXR\u00a5\u00e1 may also have extranuclear actions. Thus, RXR\u00a5\u00e1 resides in the cytoplasm in certain cell types and at different stages during development (Fukunaka et al., 2001). It migrates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to differentiation (Katagiri et al., 2000), apoptosis (Cao et al., 2004), and inflammation (Ghose et al., 2004; Zimmerman et al., 2006). Interestingly, tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 resulted from limited proteolytic cleavage in tumor cells is also cytoplasmic (Zhong et al., 2003). Whether and how it acts in the cytoplasm to modulate carcinogenesis is currently unknown. In this study, we examined whether tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 serves as an intracellular target mediating the apoptotic effect of Sulindac. In addition, we investigated the mechanism by which cytoplasmic tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 acts to promote tumor growth. Furthermore, we explored the possibility to dissociate Sulindac\u00a1\u00afs anti-cancer effects from its COX inhibition activity. RESULTS. Sulindac Binds to RXR\u00a5\u00e1. We previously reported that R-Etodolac binds RXR\u00a5\u00e1 and induces a RXR\u00a5\u00e1-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro and in animals (Kolluri et al., 2005). During the course of identifying other NSAIDs as potential RXR\u00a5\u00e1 ligands, we found that Sulindac bound to RXR\u00a5\u00e1, but not RAR (Figure S1A), with an IC 50 of 80 \u00a5\u00ecM (Figure 1A), which is in its concentration range that induces apoptosis (Yamamoto et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2000). HPLC analysis showed a direct binding of Sulindac to RXR\u00a5\u00e1 protein but not other nuclear receptors such as RAR and Nur77 in cells (Figure 1B and Figure S1C). The binding was also illustrated by altered sensitivity of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 ligand-binding domain (LBD) or full-length (fl)-RXR\u00a5\u00e1 protein to chymotrypsin digestion by Sulindac in vitro (Figure 1C). Furthermore, we took advantage of the presence of fluorine atom in Sulindac and examined 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Figure 1D shows that the signal intensity of the fluorine spectrum of Sulindac was strongly suppressed by RXR\u00a5\u00e1 LBD but not by Nur77 protein, demonstrating a direct and specific binding. Sulindac binding inhibited transactivation of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 homodimers (Figure 1E) and certain heterodimers (Figure 1F and Figure S1B) in the reporter assays, demonstrating that Sulindac is a RXR\u00a5\u00e1 transactivation antagonist. Sulindac Induces RXR\u00a5\u00e1-dependent Apoptosis. To determine the role of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 in Sulindac-induced apoptosis, we examined its death effect in F9 cells and F9 cells lacking RXR\u00a5\u00e1 (F9-RXR\u00a5\u00e1 ?/?). Sulindac induced extensive apoptosis in F9 cells, but had little effect in F9-RXR\u00a5\u00e1 ?/? cells (Figure 2A?2C). Moreover, the apoptotic effect of Sulindac was reduced in cells with diminished RXR\u00a5\u00e1 level (Figures 2D, E), whereas it was enhanced in cells with ectopically expressed RXR\u00a5\u00e1 in RXR\u00a5\u00e1-negative CV-1 cells (Figure 2F). To address the role of Sulindac binding to RXR\u00a5\u00e1, we constructed the RXR\u00a5\u00e1/F313S/R316E mutant in which Phe 313 and Arg 316 essential for maintaining the functional integrity of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 ligand-binding pocket (LBP) (Bourguet et al., 2000) were substituted with Ser and Glu, respectively. The mutant failed to respond to ligand-induced homodimer or heterodimer transactivation (Figure S2) and showed reduced apoptotic responses to Sulindac (Figure 2G). Thus, RXR\u00a5\u00e1 is involved in Sulindac-induced apoptosis. Bax, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, is required for the apoptotic effect of Sulindac (Zhang et al., 2000). We therefore determined if RXR\u00a5\u00e1 was involved in activation of Bax by Sulindac. Sulindac induced cleavage of PARP (Figure 2H) and apoptosis (Figure 2I) in HCT116 colon cancer cells, but not HCT116 cells lacking Bax (Bax ?/?). The fact that HCT116 cells are deficient of COX-2 (Sheng et al., 1997) demonstrates that Sulindac-induced apoptosis can be COX-2-independent. Immunoblotting assays showed that Bax underwent extensive oligomerization on mitochondria in response to Sulindac, which was abrogated by RXR\u00a5\u00e1 siRNA (Figure 2J). In addition, immunostaining using anti-Bax antibody (Bax/\u00a5\u00c421) and a Bax conformation-sensitive antibody Bax/6A7 (Nechushtan et al., 1999) demonstrated that Sulindac-induced Bax conformational change and mitochondrial targeting were impaired by RXR\u00a5\u00e1 siRNA (Figure 2K). Together, these results demonstrate that RXR\u00a5\u00e1 can act as an intracellular target mediating the apoptotic effect of Sulindac. Sulindac Inhibits RXR\u00a5\u00e1-dependent AKT Activation by TNF\u00a5\u00e1. Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector, AKT, regulates the biological function of substrates such as Bax (Cantley, 2002). We therefore investigated whether Sulindac activated Bax through inhibition of AKT activation and found that Sulindac potently suppressed AKT activation in HCT116 and other cancer cell lines (Figure 3A). Transfection of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 siRNA significantly reduced AKT activation (Figure 3B), similar to the effect of Sulindac, raising the possibility that Sulindac might inhibit RXR\u00a5\u00e1-mediated AKT activation. Although Sulindac failed to inhibit AKT activation induced by epidermal growth factor (Figure S3A), it potently inhibited AKT activation induced by retinoic acid in a RXR\u00a5\u00e1-dependent manner (Figures S3B?C). TNF\u00a5\u00e1 could also activate PI3K/AKT signaling (Ozes et al., 1999; Pincheira et al., 2008). We thus examined whether RXR\u00a5\u00e1 played a role in AKT activation by TNF\u00a5\u00e1. Treatment of A549 lung cancer cells with TNF\u00a5\u00e1 led to strong AKT activation, which was potently inhibited by Sulindac (Figure 3C). Transfection of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 siRNA, which inhibited not only the expression of the 54-kDa fl-RXR\u00a5\u00e1 but also a 44-kDa tRXR\u00a5\u00e1, significantly impaired the ability of TNF\u00a5\u00e1 to activate AKT (Figure 3C), demonstrating that RXR\u00a5\u00e1 was critical for AKT activation by TNF\u00a5\u00e1. Although Sulindac showed little inhibitory effect on AKT activation in cancer cells with high basal AKT activation, such as ZR-75-1 breast cancer and PC3 prostate cancer cells, it completely inhibited AKT activation when used together with TNF\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure 3D), raising an intriguing possibility that TNF\u00a5\u00e1 can sensitize cancer cells to Sulindac by converting AKT activation from a RXR\u00a5\u00e1-independent to a RXR\u00a5\u00e1-dependent manner. TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced Interaction of tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 with p85\u00a5\u00e1 and Its Inhibition by Sulindac. Our observations that RXR\u00a5\u00e1 was required for AKT activation by TNF\u00a5\u00e1 and retinoic acid prompted us to examine whether RXR\u00a5\u00e1 interacted with p85\u00a5\u00e1. Our initial intensive attempts by co-immunoprecipitation assays using anti-RXR\u00a5\u00e1 antibody (D20) against sequences in the N-terminus of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure 3E) failed to detect a clear interaction, although the antibody effectively immunoprecipitated the RXR\u00a5\u00e1 protein (Figure S3E). As tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 proteins produced through limited proteolytic cleavage in cancer cells were cytoplasmic (Nagaya et al., 1998; Zhong et al., 2003), we asked whether the cytoplasmic tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 was responsible for binding to p85\u00a5\u00e1. For this purpose, we used another anti-RXR\u00a5\u00e1 antibody (\u00a5\u00c4N197) that recognizes the RXR\u00a5\u00e1 LBD (Figure 3F). Indeed, p85\u00a5\u00e1 was readily co-immunoprecipitated by the \u00a5\u00c4N197 antibody in a TNF\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure 3E) or RA (Figures S3D?E) dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation of p85\u00a5\u00e1 was accompanied with immunoprecipitation of tRXR\u00a5\u00e1, which was not detected by the D20 RXR\u00a5\u00e1 antibody (Figure S3E), indicating its lack of N-terminal sequences. Using the \u00a5\u00c4N197 antibody, we also observed that interaction of p85\u00a5\u00e1 with tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 in the presence of TNF\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure 3E) or 9-cis-RA (Figure S3D) was inhibited by Sulindac. These results suggested that tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 might bind to p85\u00a5\u00e1, leading to AKT activation. Regulation of tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 Production and Its Activation of AKT. We reported previously that cell density plays a critical role in determining the cytoplasmic localization of RAR\u00a5\u00e3 (Han et al., 2009). We similarly observed that the level of the 44-kDa tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 reduced as the density of cells increased, which was accompanied with appearance of a smaller RXR\u00a5\u00e1 fragment. Interestingly, the levels of the 44-kDa tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 protein correlated with AKT activation (Figure 4A), suggesting that cell density-dependent proteolytic cleavage of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 might be an important mechanism regulating AKT activation. Consistent with cytoplasmic localization of tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure S4A), immunostaining of MEFs with the \u00a5\u00c4N197 antibody revealed RXR\u00a5\u00e1 staining predominantly in the cytoplasm and occasionally on the plasma membrane (Figure 4B), likely due to the high levels of tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 in MEFs. Thus, deletion of the N-terminal sequences of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 could alter its subcellular localization, conferring its ability to interact with p85\u00a5\u00e1. In an effort to study the regulation of tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 production, we found that expression of the N-terminal region of RXR\u00a5\u00e1, RXR\u00a5\u00e1/1?134, enhanced the tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 level (Figure S4B). To study the biological function of the endogenous tRXR\u00a5\u00e1, we stably expressed RXR\u00a5\u00e1/1?134 in HeLa cells, which resulted in production of a significant amount of 44-kDa tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 protein. Comparing to parental HeLa cells, HeLa/RXR\u00a5\u00e1/1?134 stable clone had much higher AKT activation (Figure 4C) and were able to rapidly grow in soft agar (Figure 4D). Sulindac strongly reduced colonies formed by the stable clone in the colony formation assay (Figure 4E). Together, these results demonstrate that tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 may contribute to the growth and survival of cancer cells by activating AKT and that tRXR\u00a5\u00e1-mediated activities can be negatively regulated by Sulindac. To study the possible pathological function of tRXR\u00a5\u00e1, we examined its expression in tumor tissues. Immunoblotting of tissue samples showed the presence of tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 in breast and liver cancer tissues but not in tumor surrounding tissues or distant normal tissues from the same patients (Figure 4F). Previous studies revealed an extensive cytoplasmic RXR\u00a5\u00e1 immunostaining in malignant human prostatic tumor (Zhong et al., 2003) and thyroid tumor (Takiyama et al., 2004) specimens. Immunohistochemical analysis using the \u00a5\u00c4N197 antibody also revealed a strong cytoplasmic RXR\u00a5\u00e1 staining in liver tumor tissue but not the surrounding tissue (Figure 4G), confirming that tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 produced in tumor tissues is cytoplasmic. Together, these results suggest that tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 may play a role in the development of cancer through its ability to activate AKT. N-terminally Truncated RXR\u00a5\u00e1 Mediates TNF\u00a5\u00e1 Activation of the PI3K/AKT Pathway and Promotes Cancer Cell Growth and Survival. To directly address the role of N-terminally truncated RXR\u00a5\u00e1, we constructed a RXR\u00a5\u00e1 mutant lacking its N-terminal 80 amino acids (RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480) with a molecular weight similar to the endogenous tRXR\u00a5\u00e1. Also similar to tRXR\u00a5\u00e1, RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 interacted with p85\u00a5\u00e1, which was strongly enhanced by TNF\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure 5A). In contrast, the full-length RXR\u00a5\u00e1 did not interact with p85\u00a5\u00e1 either in the absence or presence of TNF\u00a5\u00e1, suggesting that the N-terminal sequences of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 prevented its binding to p85\u00a5\u00e1. Interestingly, RXR\u00a5\u00e1 mutant lacking the N-terminal 100 amino acids (RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c4100) was unable to interact with p85\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure 5A). This was consistent with the fact that RXR\u00a5\u00e1/1?134 but not RXR\u00a5\u00e1/223?462 could interact with p85\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure 5B). The role of RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 in AKT activation was demonstrated by that expression of RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 but not RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c4100 strongly activated AKT in different cell types (Figure 5C). Consistent with cytoplasmic localization of tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 (Figures 4B and S4A), RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 predominantly resided in the cytoplasm, with occasional punctate plasma membrane localization (Figure 5D). Thus, deletion of the N-terminal sequences of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 alters its subcellular localization and confers its ability to interact with p85\u00a5\u00e1. To determine how tRXR\u00a5\u00e1/p85\u00a5\u00e1 interaction induced AKT activation, we examined whether RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 immunocomplex possessed PI3K activity in vitro. The PI3K activity exhibited by the Myc-RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 immunocomplex was dramatically enhanced by TNF\u00a5\u00e1 treatment (Figures 5E and S5A?B), which correlated well with its ability to interact with p85\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure 5A) and activation of AKT (Figure 5C). Thus, TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced tRXR\u00a5\u00e1/p85\u00a5\u00e1 interaction can activate the PI3K/AKT signaling. To further study the role of tRXR\u00a5\u00e1, we stably expressed RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 in SW480 and HCT116 colon cancer cells. The resulting stable clones, SW480/RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 and HCT116/RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480, showed elevated AKT activation and induction of its downstream targets c-Myc and cyclin D1 (Figure 5F) and increased clonogenic survival than do the control cells (Figure 5G). We then examined the effect of RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 on the growth of cancer cells in animals by injecting the same number of RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 expressing cells and the control cells into different flanks of same nude mice. Our results showed that tumors formed by SW480/RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 and HCT116/RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 grew much faster than those formed by the control cells (Figures 5H?I). Together, these results demonstrate that the N-terminally truncated RXR\u00a5\u00e1 is a potent promoter of cancer cell growth. Sulindac Activates TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced Extrinsic Apoptotic Pathway. We next determined whether and how synergistic inhibition of AKT activation by Sulindac and TNF\u00a5\u00e1 induced apoptosis. Treatment of various cancer cell lines with Sulindac and TNF\u00a5\u00e1 effectively induced PARP cleavage and caspase-8 activation (indicated by cleaved caspase-8 products, p43/p41), while treatment of these cells with either Sulindac or TNF\u00a5\u00e1 alone had little effect (Figures 6A and S6). The apoptotic effect of Sulindac/TNF\u00a5\u00e1 combination was partially suppressed by RXR\u00a5\u00e1-selective ligand SR11237 (Figure 6A) or transfection of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 siRNA (Figure 6B). Our observation that Sulindac/TNF\u00a5\u00e1 activated caspase-8 suggested that apoptosis induction might be due to the activation of TNF\u00a5\u00e1-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway. To address this, we treated cells with the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk or with Caspase-8 siRNA and observed suppression of Sulindac/TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced PARP cleavage (Figures 6C, 6D and S6B?D). Thus, Sulindac/TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced apoptosis is mediated by the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. We also examined whether Sulindac/TNF\u00a5\u00e1 activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway resulted in Bax activation by immunostaining cells using conformation-sensitive Bax/6A7 antibody. Significant Bax staining was observed only when cells were treated with both TNF\u00a5\u00e1 and Sulindac (Figure 6E). Cross-talk between extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways can be linked through Bid cleavage and activation (Li et al., 1998). Indeed, we observed that Bid was significantly degraded in cells treated with TNF\u00a5\u00e1 and Sulindac (Figure 6A), suggesting that Sulindac/TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced Bax activation might be mediated through Bid activation. Our observation that Sulindac/TNF\u00a5\u00e1 combination synergistically induced apoptosis and inhibited AKT activation suggested that AKT activity might be critical for their induction of apoptosis. Indeed, Sulindac/TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced PARP cleavage was inhibited by the expression of a constitutive-active AKT (CA-AKT) and enhanced by the expression of a dominant-negative AKT (DN-AKT) (Figure 6F). Consistently, induction of apoptosis and activation of caspase-8 and Bax by Sulindac/TNF\u00a5\u00e1 combination was inhibited by CA-AKT (Figures 6G, 6H, and S6E). To study how Sulindac promoted apoptosis through its inhibition of AKT, we examined the expression of c-FLIP, a downstream target gene of AKT signaling (Panka et al., 2001), which acts as a potent inhibitor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway by inhibiting caspase-8 activation (Irmler et al., 1997). Treatment of cells with TNF\u00a5\u00e1 resulted in strong induction of both short form (c-FLIP S) and long form (c-FLIP L) of c-FLIP, which was inhibited by Sulindac (Figure 6I). Thus, Sulindac might induce apoptosis by suppressing the inducing effect of TNF\u00a5\u00e1 on c-FLIP expression. Design and Synthesis of RXR\u00a5\u00e1-selective Sulindac Analogs. Our finding that RXR\u00a5\u00e1 served as an intracellular target of Sulindac action provided an opportunity to design RXR\u00a5\u00e1-selective Sulindac derivatives for cancer therapy. Thus, we conducted docking of Sulindac to three-dimensional structures of the RXR\u00a5\u00e1 LBD to identify strategies for structural modifications of Sulindac in order to dissociate its COX inhibition from RXR\u00a5\u00e1-binding activity. Docking of Sulindac to RXR\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure 7A) showed that Sulindac bound in a mode where its carboxylate group was aligned with the carboxylate group found in all RXR\u00a5\u00e1 ligands examined (Figure 7B), interacting with Arg 316 in the RXR\u00a5\u00e1 LBP. The benzyl methyl sulfide portion of Sulindac bound to the hydrophobic region of the RXR\u00a5\u00e1 LBP, overlapping with the a-ionone ring of 9-cis-RA. In this binding mode, Van der Waals interaction of the ?SCH3 group at position 4 (Figure 7C) with the RXR\u00a5\u00e1 protein was not optimal and there was room around it for modification to improve the binding to RXR\u00a5\u00e1. The idea of making use of position 4 to design RXR\u00a5\u00e1-selective analogs was fully supported by the fact that sulindac prodrug, sulindac sulfoxide and the metabolite sulindac sulfone show no COX-inhibiting activity, whereas the metabolite sulindac sulfide (used in this study) is a potent COX inhibitor (Haanen, 2001). As shown in Figure 7A, the carboxylate group of Sulindac was positioned away from Arg 316 compared to the equivalent ones in RXR\u00a5\u00e1 ligands DHA, BMS649, and 9-cis-RA. Replacing ?CH2COOH at position D with a bulkier group such as ?CH2CH2COOH would help place the carboxylate group closer to Arg 316 to achieve good charge-charge interaction with RXR\u00a5\u00e1 as observed in 9-cis-RA. Our candidate compounds were also examined by docking to the crystal structure of COX-2 (Kurumbail et al., 1996) (Figure S7) to identify non-COX binders. Based on these considerations, five analogs were designed and synthesized (Figures 7C and S7). Their evaluation showed that all analogs retained RXR\u00a5\u00e1-binding activity, with K-80003 being the most potent, likely due to its iso-propyl (i-Pr) group at position 4, which has improved interaction with the hydrophobic residues on Helix7 of RXR\u00a5\u00e1. Significantly, K-80003 and K-80005 had no detectable inhibition of COX activities and failed to inhibit constitutive and TNF\u00a5\u00e1 or IL-1\u00a5\u00e2-induced prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) production (Figures 7C, D, and data not shown). The binding of K-80003 to RXR\u00a5\u00e1 was also confirmed by 19F NMR binding assays (Figure 7E). Thus, Sulindac\u00a1\u00afs RXR\u00a5\u00e1-binding can be dissociated from its COX-binding. RXR\u00a5\u00e1-selective Analog K-80003 is a Potent Inhibitor of AKT Activation and Cancer Cell Growth. Because of its much-improved affinity to RXR\u00a5\u00e1 and lack of COX inhibitory effect, K-80003 was chosen for further evaluation. Immunoblotting showed that K-80003 was much more effective than Sulindac in inhibiting RA- and TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced AKT activation (Figures 8A and S8). Figure 8B shows that the inhibitory effect of K-80003 on AKT activation in PC3 cells is largely impaired by reducing RXR\u00a5\u00e1, but not RAR\u00a5\u00e3, expression by siRNA. Thus, inhibition of AKT activation by K-80003 was also dependent on RXR\u00a5\u00e1 expression. The interaction of RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 with p85\u00a5\u00e1 either in the absence or presence of TNF\u00a5\u00e1 was more potently inhibited by K-80003 than by Sulindac (Figure 8C). K-80003 was also more effective than Sulindac in inducing PARP cleavage when used together with TNF\u00a5\u00e1 in ZR-75-1 cells (Figure 8D). Similar to Sulindac, K-80003 combination with TNF\u00a5\u00e1 synergistically induced PARP cleavage and caspase-8 activation (Figure 8E). In clonogenic survival assays, colony formation of HeLa/RXR\u00a5\u00e1/1?134 and RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 cells was almost completely suppressed by K-80003 (Figure 8F). Significantly, K-80003 exhibited much more potent inhibitory effect than Sulindac on the growth of RXR\u00a5\u00e1/\u00a5\u00c480 tumor in animals (Figure 8G). Together, the RXR\u00a5\u00e1-selective Sulindac analog K-80003 is a potent inhibitor of RXR\u00a5\u00e1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling and cancer cell growth. DISCUSSION. RXR\u00a5\u00e1 is an attractive molecular target for drug development. Here we report that Sulindac could bind to RXR\u00a5\u00e1 in the range of concentrations commonly used to study the anti-cancer effects of Sulindac. Conventional administration of Sulindac could result in about 10?15 \u00a5\u00ecM Sulindac in the serum of patients and up to approximately 50 \u00a5\u00ecM of Sulindac could be detected in the plasma of humans (Yamamoto et al., 1999). Sulindac could be also concentrated in epithelial cells at concentrations that are at least 20-fold higher than those in the serum (Duggan et al., 1980). Thus, the binding affinity of Sulindac to RXR\u00a5\u00e1 is relevant to in vivo cancer prevention by this drug. The facts that Sulindac can bind to RXR\u00a5\u00e1 and that the apoptotic effect of Sulindac largely depends on RXR\u00a5\u00e1 expression and its intact LBP strongly suggest that RXR\u00a5\u00e1 is an intracellular target of Sulindac. An important finding of this study is that the N-terminally truncated RXR\u00a5\u00e1 protein acts differently from the full-length RXR\u00a5\u00e1 protein. Cytoplasmic tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 interacted with p85\u00a5\u00e1 to activate the PI3K/AKT survival pathway and induce anchorage-independent cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in animals, implying that tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 may serve as an important tumor promoter. Our mutational analysis suggested that amino acids from 80 to 100 in RXR\u00a5\u00e1 are critical for tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 binding to p85\u00a5\u00e1. The region is enriched with proline resides, which can presumably form several polyproline helices (PPII helix) known to bind to the SH3 domain (Kaneko et al., 2008) that is present in p85\u00a5\u00e1. The p85\u00a5\u00e1-binding motif(s) in RXR\u00a5\u00e1 are likely masked by the N-terminal end sequences and regulated by phosphorylation. This is consistent with the regulation of tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 production and AKT activation by cell density. Regulated proteolysis is a key step in a number of different signaling pathways. Caspase-mediated cleavage of the BH3-only protein Bid into a truncated protein (tBid) and subsequent translocation of tBid to mitochondria are implicated in death receptor signaling (Li et al., 1998), whereas proteolytic processing of Notch and nuclear translocation of truncated product are crucial steps in transduction of the Notch signaling (Ye et al., 1999). STAT signaling is also regulated by proteolytic processing (Hendry and John, 2004). Thus, cleavage of RXR\u00a5\u00e1 may represent a mechanism that triggers nongenomic tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 signaling by removing the inhibitory N-terminal domain, allowing tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 to expose its p85\u00a5\u00e1-binding motif and activate the PI3K/AKT signaling. Our finding that tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 is often produced in tumor tissues but not in normal tissues is consistent with previous findings that RXR\u00a5\u00e1 is cleaved in tumor but not in premalignant or normal tissues from patients with prostate or thyroid cancer (Takiyama et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2003). Thus, agents targeting tRXR\u00a5\u00e1-mediated pathway can be effective and tumor specific. To this end, we showed that Sulindac could inhibit the tRXR\u00a5\u00e1-mediated PI3K/AKT activation, suggesting that Sulindac represents a lead for a class of anti-cancer agents targeting this pathway. Our observation that Sulindac and TNF\u00a5\u00e1 synergistically inhibit tRXR\u00a5\u00e1-dependent AKT activation provides insight into the crosstalk between retinoid receptor and TNF\u00a5\u00e1 signaling pathways. Retinoids in combination with cytokines, such as TNF\u00a5\u00e1 and TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), can synergistically induce differentiation or apoptosis of human transformed cells (Altucci et al., 2005) whereas combination of retinoids and TNF\u00a5\u00e1 can overcome RA resistance (Witcher et al., 2004). The fact that Sulindac and TNF\u00a5\u00e1 synergistically inhibit AKT activation in cancer cells implies that TNF\u00a5\u00e1 and probably other cytokines can prime cancer cells for their responsiveness to RXR\u00a5\u00e1 ligands such as Sulindac by converting AKT activation from a RXR\u00a5\u00e1-independent to a RXR\u00a5\u00e1-dependent manner. TNF\u00a5\u00e1 plays important roles in diverse cellular events such as cell survival and death. However, it often fails to induce apoptosis in cancer cells due to its simultaneous activation of the NF-\u00a5\u00eaB and/or the PI3K/AKT pathway (Aggarwal, 2003; Balkwill, 2009). Our observation that tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 mediates AKT activation by TNF\u00a5\u00e1 suggests a possibility of using Sulindac or analogs to suppress TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced AKT-mediated survival function, thereby shifting its function from survival to death. Consistently, we have provided evidence that Sulindac in combination with TNF\u00a5\u00e1 potently induce tRXR\u00a5\u00e1-dependent caspase-8 activation and apoptosis, demonstrating that Sulindac was able to sensitize cancer cells to TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The fact that TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced c-FLIP expression is completely prevented by Sulindac places c-FLIP in a central position for integrating TNF\u00a5\u00e1-induced AKT activation and its inhibition by Sulindac and induction of apoptosis by Sulindac and TNF\u00a5\u00e1 combination. Our finding that RXR\u00a5\u00e1 serves as an intracellular target of Sulindac action provides a rationale to design RXR\u00a5\u00e1-selective Sulindac derivatives for suppressing AKT activity. Our identification of a Sulindac analog, K-80003, with improved affinity to RXR\u00a5\u00e1 but lacking COX inhibitory effects offers an example to this approach. It is expected that K-80003 will lack or have much reduced COX-2-associated side effects. The fact that K-80003 could effectively inhibit the tRXR\u00a5\u00e1 pathway and the growth of cancer cells in vitro and in animals warrants its further development for cancer therapy.

                "text": "Design and Synthesis of Bis-Biotin-Containing Reagents for Applications Utilizing Monoclonal Antibody-Based Pretargeting Systems with Streptavidin Mutants\tPrevious studies have shown that pretargeting protocols, using cancer-targeting fusion proteins, composed of 4 anti-CD20 single chain Fv (scFv) fragments and streptavidin (scFv 4-SAv), followed by a biotinylated dendrimeric N-acetyl-galactosamine blood clearing agent (CA), 1, then a radiolabeled DOTA-biotin derivative (a mono-biotin), 3a, can provide effective therapy for lymphoma xenografts in mouse models. A shortcoming in this pretargeting system is that endogenous biotin may affect its efficacy in patients. To circumvent this potential problem, we investigated a pretargeting system that employs anti-CD20 scFv 4-SAv mutant fusion proteins with radioiodinated bis-biotin derivatives. With that combination of reagents good localization of the radiolabel to lymphoma tumor xenografts was obtained in the presence of endogenous biotin. However, the blood clearance reagents employed in the studies were ineffective, resulting in abnormally high levels of radioactivity in other tissues. Thus, in the present investigation a bis-biotin-tri-galactose blood clearance reagent, 2, was designed, synthesized and evaluated in vivo. Additionally, another DOTA-biotin derivative (a bis-biotin), 4a, was designed and synthesized, such that radiometals (e.g. 111In, 90Y, 177Lu) could be used in the pretargeting protocols employing scFv 4-SAv mutant fusion proteins. Studies in mice demonstrated that the CA 2 was more effective than CA 1 at removing [ 125I]scFv 4-SAv-S45A mutant fusion proteins from blood. Another in vivo study compared tumor targeting and normal tissue concentrations of the new reagents (2 & [ 111In]4b) with standard reagents (1 and [ 111In]3b) used in pretargeting protocols. The study showed that lymphoma xenografts could be targeted in the presence of endogenous biotin when anti-CD20 fusion proteins containing SAv mutants (scFv 4-SAv-S45A or scFv 4-SAv-Y43A) were employed in combination with CA 2 and [ 111In]4b. Importantly, normal tissue concentrations of [ 111In]4b were similar to those obtained using the standard reagents (1 & [ 111In]3b), except that the blood and liver concentrations were slightly higher with the new reagents. While the reasons for the higher blood and liver concentrations are unknown, the differences in the galactose structures of the clearance agents 1 and 2 may play a role. INTRODUCTION. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT 3) employing radiolabeled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) has proven to be efficacious as a treatment for patients with B-cell lymphomas (1). While it seems likely that changes being evaluated in the current RIT treatment regimens will increase efficacy and/or decrease toxicity (2?4), newer approaches to RIT, such as cancer \u00a1\u00b0pretargeting\u00a1\u00b1 (5?7), may provide more significant improvements in the treatment of lymphoma. One of the pretargeting approaches being investigated uses monoclonal antibody-streptavidin (MAb-SAv) conjugates (8?10), or related scFv 4-SAv fusion proteins, in protocols where they are administered in an initial step, followed in subsequent steps by administration of a blood clearance agent, then a biotin derivative labeled with a therapeutic radionuclide. In preclinical investigations, it has been conclusively shown that pretargeting protocols in mouse models using MAb-SAv conjugates, or fusion proteins, reactive with CD20 (11), or other lymphoma cell surface antigens (12, 13), either alone or in combinations (14), provides a more efficacious therapy than obtained with conventional RIT. Although the MAb-SAv/radiolabeled biotin pretargeting approach benefits from the very high affinity of the biotin-SAv binding pair, a potential limitation in the approach is the fact that patient serum contains significant amounts of biotin (15). Based on animal studies (16), it is possible that endogenous biotin in patients blood can bind with administered MAb-SAv conjugates or fusion proteins to block the binding of subsequently administered blood clearance and radiolabeled biotin derivatives. To circumvent this problem, new MAb-SAv/biotin binding pairs were designed and prepared. Site-directed mutations of the biotin-binding pocket in streptavidin (SAv) were performed to prepare SAv mutants that have decreased binding with biotin (17). Subsequently, those SAv mutants were used to prepare scFv 4-SAv mutant fusion proteins (18). It was hypothesized that the decrease in biotin binding in the SAv mutants could be off-set by using bis-biotin derivatives, which would have increased binding due to dual binding with a single SAv molecule (19) and an avidity effect (20). Therefore, a series of bis-biotin derivatives were synthesized and their binding with SAv mutants was assessed. Importantly, it was demonstrated that the bis-biotin derivatives could bind with the SAv mutants in the presence of biotin (21). Later pretargeting studies demonstrated that tumor xenografts could be effectively targeted using scFv 4-SAv mutant fusion proteins, a blood clearance agent, and a radioiodinated bis-biotin derivative, even when the mice were placed on a normal (biotin-containing) diet (22). While the studies successfully demonstrated that a MAb-SAv/biotin-based pretargeting approach targeted tumors in the presence of endogenous biotin, the concentrations of radioactivity in normal tissues were much higher than those obtained in other pretargeting studies. The higher normal tissue concentrations appeared to be caused by a lack of efficient blood clearance when using either of the two blood clearing agents studied. Those agents included; [1] a monobiotin-hexadecyl-N-acetylgalactose derivative, 1, (Figure 1) and [2] a galactosylated and bis-biotinylated human serum albumin derivative (22). In the current studies, two new reagents, 2 and 4a (Figure 1), were synthesized for use in pretargeting protocols with scFv4-SAv mutant fusion proteins. A new biotin-containing blood clearance agent, 2, was designed and synthesized to evaluate the hypothesis that the unacceptably high concentrations of a radioiodinated bis-biotin derivative in normal tissues previously obtained was due to ineffective blood clearance of the antibody-SAv mutant fusion protein. Additionally, a bis-biotin derivative containing the metal chelation moiety DOTA, 4a was designed and synthesized due to our interest in using radiometals, such as Indium-111 ( 111In) and Yttrium-90 ( 90Y) in pretargeting protocols. The bis-biotin-DOTA derivative, 4a, was designed to be similar to the bis-biotiniodobenzoyl derivative previously shown to bind selectively with SAv mutants in the presence of biotin (21). In addition to syntheses of the new reagents, studies were conducted in mice to demonstrate that the new reagents functioned as designed. A study was conducted in mice to compare the blood clearance of a scFv 4-SAv mutant fusion in the presence of endogenous biotin when the clearing agents 1 and 2 were employed. Another study was conducted to evaluate whether 111In-labeled 4a, [ 111In]4b, could successfully target tumors in athymic mice bearing Ramos lymphoma. In that study, an anti-CD20 scFv 4-SAv mutant fusion protein was administered, followed by blood clearance with 2, then administration of an 111In-labeled biotin derivative. For comparison, the biodistribution of [ 111In]4b alone was evaluated in mice. The results obtained in the synthesis of 2 and 4a, preparation of radiolabeled biotin derivatives, [ 111In]3a/[ 111In]4a, and use of those reagents in animal studies are described herein. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES. General. Chemicals purchased from commercial sources were analytical grade or better, and were used without further purification. Di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate, 2,2\u00a1\u00af-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine), nitromethanetrispropionic acid, acetobromo-\u00a5\u00e1-D-galactose (2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-\u00a5\u00e1-D-galactopyranosyl bromide), 3-iodopropionic acid, 1,1\u00a1\u00af-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), 1,1\u00a1\u00af-thiocarbonyldiimidazole (TCDI), Amberlite IR120 (hydrogen form), and most other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). L-aspartic acid \u00a5\u00e1-t-butyl ester, 10, was obtained from Novabiochem (AMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA). D-biotin, 9, N-Boc-trioxatridecanediamine, 16, and N-(phthalimido)amino-dPEG 4-acid, 19, were gifts from Quanta BioDesign, Powell, OH; aminobenzyl-DOTA (S-2-(4-Aminobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid), 31, was obtained from Macrocyclics, Inc. (Dallas, TX). Biotin-sarcosine-aminobenzyl-DOTA, 3a, was prepared as previously described (23) [currently available from Macrocyclics, Inc, Dallas, TX]. 2,3,5,6-Tetrafluorophenyl trifluoroacetate, TFP-OTFA was prepared as previously described (24). Sephadex LH-20 gel filtration resin was obtained from Fluka (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI). Melting points were obtained in open capillary tubes on a Mel-Temp II apparatus with a Fluke 51 K/J electronic thermometer, and are uncorrected. Radioactive Materials. All radioactive materials were handled according to approved protocols at the University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Standard methods for safely using radioactive materials were employed (25). Sodium [ 125I]Iodide and [ 111In]Indium chloride were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Billerica, MA). Measurement of 125I and 111In was conducted on a Capintec CRC-15R Radioisotope Calibrator using calibration numbers provided by the manufacturer. Samples containing 125I or 111In were counted in a Packard Cobra II gamma counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Services, Waltham, MA). Radioactivity counts were imported into an Excel Spreadsheet (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) where calculations of percent injected dose (%ID) and percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g) were made. Spectral Analyses. 1H NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AV 500 (500 MHz) instrument. Proton chemical shifts are expressed as ppm using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard (\u00a5\u00e4 = 0.0 ppm). Low-resolution mass spectral (LRMS) and high-resolution mass spectral (HRMS) data were obtained on a Bruker APEX III 47e Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometer using electrospray ionization. For analysis, the samples were dissolved in 50/50 MeOH/H 2O and were introduced by an integral syringe infusion pump (Cole Parmer Series 74900). Chromatography. All synthetic reactions were monitored by HPLC. Samples were assessed on a system that contained a Hewlett-Packard quaternary 1050 gradient pump, a variable wavelength UV detector (254 nm), and a Varex ELSD MKIII or an Alltech ELSD 2000 evaporative light-scattering detector. Analyses of HPLC data were conducted using Hewlett-Packard HPLC ChemStation software. Reversed-phase HPLC chromatography was carried out on an Alltech Altima C-18 column (5 \u00a5\u00ecm, 250 \u00a1\u00bf 4.5 mm) using a gradient solvent system at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A gradient of MeOH and H 2O/0.1% HOAc was used. Starting with 40% MeOH, the initial solvent mixture was held for 2 min, then the gradient was increased to 100% MeOH over the next 10 min, then held at 100% MeOH for 8 min. Retention times (t R) under these conditions for compounds are provided with the compound experimental. Some synthesized compounds were purified from crude reaction mixtures using a Biotage SP Flash Purification System (Charlottesville, VA) on a reversed-phase C18 FLASH 25+M column. The purification used a gradient mixture composed of MeOH and 0.1% aqueous HOAc solution (pH 3.25). The gradient started with 25% MeOH / 75% HOAc/H 2O, and that mixture was held for 2 min. Following that, the % MeOH was increased linearly to 100% over the next 10 min, then held at 100% for 8 min. Fractions were collected based on UV detection at 215 or 254 nm. Fractions containing pure products were determined by analytical HPLC and were combined, solvent evaporated, and isolated to provide the yields listed. The 111In-labeling reactions of biotin derivatives 3a and 4a, to prepare [ 111In]3b and [ 111In]4b, were followed by radio-HPLC, and the products were purified by isolation from the HPLC effluent. The HPLC equipment used consisted of a Hewlett-Packard quaternary 1050 gradient pump, Waters 601 UV detector, and a Beckman model 170 radioisotope detector. Analysis of the HPLC data was conducted on Hewlett-Packard HPLC ChemStation software. The separations used a C-18 column (Altima C-18, 5 mm, 250 \u00a1\u00bf 4.5 mm; Alltech, Deerfield, IL) with a gradient eluting at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The gradient was composed of MeOH as solvent A and 0.1% HOAc in water as solvent B. The gradient started at 60% B, which was held for 2 min, then the percent of MeOH was increased linearly to 100% over the next 10 min. After reaching 100% MeOH, it was held at there for 8 min. 5-N-(tert-Butyloxycarbonyl)aminoisophthalate-1,3-bis-O-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl) ester, 6.

Analyses by avidin bead assay showed that 85?95% of the [ 111In]4b bound with avidin. Avidin Bead Assay. The avidin beads were prepared for use by the following procedure. A solution of avidin-agarose from the manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich #A9207-5 mL or ImmunoPure Immobilized Avidin Gel, Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. Rockford, IL) was vortexed, and then a 300 \u00a5\u00ecL aliquot of the suspended avidin-agarose beads was added to a microcentrifuge filter (Fisher #07?200?387; 0.45 mm cellulose acetate spin column with centrifuge tube filter). The filter was placed in a microcentrifuge and spun at 1000g for 1 min. The filtrate was discarded. The binding assay was conducted as follows. A 300 \u00a5\u00ecL aliquot of PBS was added to filter (with avidin-agarose) and vortexed to thoroughly mix. The beads were spun at 1000g for 1 min, and then the PBS filtrate was discarded. The PBS washing step was repeated, then an aliquot (up to 2 \u00a5\u00ecL) of 111In-labeled biotin ([ 111In]3b or [ 111In]4b) was added to the suspended beads, and this suspension was vortexed to mix thoroughly. The 111In-labeled biotin was incubated with the beads for 10 min at room temperature. The mixture was vortexed to mix, then placed in microcentrifuge and spun at 1000g for 1 min. The filtrate was set aside, and 300 \u00a5\u00ecL of PBS was added to the avidin-agarose beads as a wash. The filter was vortexed to mix, then was placed in a microcentrifuge and spun at 1000g for 1 min. The filtrate was combined with the previous filtrate. The microcentrifuge filter containing avidin-agarose beads was placed in a tube, then that tube and the tube containing the combined filtrates were counted in a gamma. The quantity of 111In-labeled biotin derivative remaining in the filter (% bound) was calculated as [radioactivity in filter]/[radioactivity in filter]+[radioactivity in filtrates]*100.

Synthesis and purification of anti-CD20 1F5 scFv 4-SAv fusion proteins. The production and purification of 1F5 scFv 4-SAv-WT fusion protein and the related site-directed SAv mutant fusion proteins, 1F5 scFv 4-SAv-S45A and 1F5 scFv 4-SAv-Y43A, have been previously described (17, 18). Briefly, scFv-SAv fusion genes were produced by molecularly fusing the single-chain variable regions (scFv) of the murine anti-CD20 1F5 antibody to either the full length SAv wild-type gene or SAv mutant genes. The resultant fusion proteins were expressed in the periplasmic space of E. coli and spontaneously formed stable soluble tetramers of 1F5 scFv 4-SAv with a molecular weight of 174 kDa. The 1F5-SAv fusion proteins were formulated at a concentration of 3 mg/mL in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 5% sorbitol. Preparation of 1F5 [ 125I]scFv 4-SAv-S45A fusion protein. Fusion proteins were radioiodinated with Na[ 125I]I (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) by the chloramine-T method in a manner similar to that previously published (32). Briefly, 50 \u00a5\u00ecL of a 1 mg/mL solution of chloramine-T (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to 500 \u00a5\u00ecL fusion protein. Next the Na[ 125I]I was added and the solution vortexed. Following a 1 minute incubation at room temperature, 5 \u00a5\u00ecL of a 1 mg/mL solution of sodium metabisulfite was added and the solution was vortexed. The contents were pipetted onto a pre-washed PD10 column, eluted with PBS, collecting 600 \u00a5\u00ecL fractions. The amount of radioactivity in each fraction was measured in a Capintec CRC-7 Radioisotope Calibrator, and early fractions with the highest activity were pooled to obtain the labeled fusion protein.

Biodistributions of [ 111In]3b and [ 111In]4b in tumor-bearing mice pretargeted with 1F5 scFv 4-SAv fusion proteins. Female FoxN1 NU athymic nude mice were separated into four groups, and were fed either a standard diet (group 1) or biotin-free diet (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) (groups 2?4). Ramos cells (10 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6) were injected subcutaneously in the right flank of each mouse. Mice were monitored until palpable tumor nodules appeared (7?10 days) and mice with tumors of similar sizes (5?10 mm 3) were selected for the experiment. Groups of 5 mice were injected intravenously with 500 \u00a5\u00ecg (2.9 nmol) of 1F5 scFv 4-SAv?WT (groups 1 and 2), or one of the SAv mutant fusion proteins, 1F5 scFv 4-SAv-S45A (group 3), or 1F5 scFv 4-SAv-Y43A (group 4). After 20 hours, the mice were injected with either 50 \u00a5\u00ecg (5.8 nmol) of 1 (groups 1 and 2) or 17.5 \u00a5\u00ecg (5.8 nmol) of 2 (groups 3 and 4).

Mice were euthanized, and tumors and normal organs were harvested 24 hours after injection of radioactivity. Selected tissues and tumors were weighed and counted in a gamma counter. Counts were corrected for decay using standard aliquots of the injectate. The percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g) values for tissues and tumor xenografts were calculated.

Groups of mice were euthanized at 1, 4 and 24 h post injection of [ 111In]4b, and preselected tissues were harvested and counted in a gamma counter. The percent of injected dose per gram (%ID/g) of blood or tissue was calculated. A tabulation of the biodistribution data is provided as Table S3 in Supporting Information. RESULTS. Synthesis of the blood clearance agent, 2. The synthesis of 2 utilized a convergent approach, combining a bis-biotin component, a tetrafunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG) component, and a galactosyl component. The syntheses of the individual components are shown in Schemes 1 ? 3. The synthetic steps to prepare the bis-biotin derivative 13 are shown in Scheme 1. In the synthesis, aminoisophthalic acid, 5, was modified with di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate, then tetrafluorophenol and EDC were used to prepare N-Boc-aminoisophthalate di-tetrafluorophenyl ester, 6. Reaction of 6 with mono-Boc protected diamino-dioxaoctane, 7, and triethylamine in anhydrous DMF provided the tri-N-Boc protected aminoisophthalic acid derivative, 8. After removal of the N-Boc groups on 8 with neat TFA, the resulting alkyl amines were reacted with the tetrafluorophenyl ester of the biotin-aspartate adduct 12, which was prepared from biotin, 9, as previously described (28). That reaction provided the anilino-bis-biotin derivative 13 in 74% yield. It should be noted that the synthesis was conducted in this manner so that the aspartate carboxylates remained as tert-butyl esters in bis-biotin derivative 13, since that is required to prepare the isocyanate functionality in a later step of the synthesis. A key part of the design of the blood-clearing agent 2 was the inclusion of three galactosyl groups at the terminus of polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer arms. A PEG-containing tetra-functional molecule, 21, was utilized as a core for the branched galactosyl portion of 2. The synthesis to prepare 21 is shown in Scheme 2. In the synthesis, nitromethane-tris-propionic acid, 14, was converted to the tris-tetrafluorophenyl ester 15 in 96% yield by reaction with tetrafluorophenyl-O-trifluoroacetate (TFP-OTFA) and triethylamine in DMF. Reaction of 15 with an excess of N-Boc-trioxatridecanediamine, 16, provided the adduct 17 in 92% yield. Reduction of the nitro group in 17 by hydrogenation over Raney-Nickel gave nearly a quantitative yield of the amino derivative 18. Reaction of the hindered amine in 18 with the phthalimido-protected amino-dPEG\u00a2\u00e2 4-acid, 19, and DCC/HOBT in DMF at room temperature for 72 hours provided a 72% yield of adduct 20. Removal of the phthalimide protecting group using hydrazine in ethanol for 16 hours provided a 78% yield of the tetra-functional intermediate, 21. The tetra-O-acetyl-galactose derivative 25 used in the synthesis of 2 was prepared as shown in Scheme 3. Nucleophilic displacement of the bromine in acetylbromo-\u00a5\u00e1-D-galactose, 22, by reaction of thiourea in refluxing acetone produced the \u00a5\u00e2-pseudothiourea derivative 23 in 69% yield. Reaction of 23 with 3-iodopropionic acid in a basic acetone/water mixture gave a 96% yield of the galactose-thiopropionic acid derivative, 24. Preparation of the tetrafluorophenyl ester derivative, 25, was achieved in nearly quantitative yield by reaction of 24 with TFP-OTFA. The final sequence of reactions, which combined the three components to produce 2, is shown in Scheme 4. The reaction sequence began with conversion of the bis-biotin derivative 13 to the phenylisocyanate, 26, by reaction with carbonyldiimidazole (CDI). Reaction of 26 with 21 provided the adduct 27 in 88% yield. Deprotection of the N-Boc and tert-butyl esters in 27 was accomplished in one step by reaction in neat trifluoroacetic acid to provide a 69% yield of intermediate 28. Reaction of 28 with the tetra-O-acetyl-galactose derivative 25 provided 29 in 91% yield. In the final step, the acetyl protecting groups were removed from 29 using an acid form of an ion exchange column to provide a 94% yield of the targeted blood clearance agent 2. Syntheses of the bis-biotin-DOTA derivative, 4a. Partial synthesis of the radiometal-binding bis-biotin derivative 4a is shown in Scheme 5. The initial steps of the synthesis involved preparation of bis-biotin derivative 13, as described previously (and shown in Scheme 1). Conversion of the aniline in 13 to the phenylisothiocyanate functionality in 30 was accomplished by reaction with thiocarbonyldiimidazole (TCDI). The isothiocyanate derivative, 30, was prepared and used in this coupling reaction, rather than the phenylisocyanate, 26, due to the low reactivity of the aniline. Reaction of 30 with aminobenzylDOTA, 31, using pyridine as the base, provided the adduct 32 in 75% yield. Removal of the tert-butyl esters in 32 was accomplished in neat TFA to provide the bis-DOTA-biotin compound 4a in 95% yield. Radiolabeling. The 1F5 scFv 4-SAv-S45A mutant fusion protein was radioiodinated in a standard protocol using chloramine-T as the oxidant. Several 111In-labeling reactions of the biotin derivative 3a conducted for these studies provided isolated radiochemical yields (72?95%) of [ 111In]3b, with radiochemical purities of 95?99% being obtained as measured in an avidin binding assay. It should be noted that the labeling yields reported are for the isolated product, and in some examples not all of the [ 111In]3b was isolated from the HPLC eluant making the radiolabeling yields appear lower. In labeling optimization studies, radiolabeling yields of 97+% were obtained for [ 111In]3b under a variety of reaction conditions studied. Radiolabeling reactions of 4a with 111In were more variable, providing ranges of isolated radiochemical yields from 45% to 94% under the reaction conditions used. The radiolabeled product was purified by radio-HPLC. Analysis of the radiochemical purity of [ 111In]4b, as determined by the avidin bead assay, was 85?95% for the preparations (some were HPLC purified). In subsequent labeling optimization studies, it was found that consistently high 111In-labeling yields (90+%) could be obtained for the reaction of 4a by conducting the reactions in 0.5 M ammonium acetate buffer at pH 5.3 and lowering the reaction temperature to 45\u00a1\u00c6C (from 85\u00a1\u00c6C). Comparison of blood clearance with 1 and 2. An experiment was conducted to determine the effectiveness of 1 and 2 for decreasing 1F5 scFv 4-SAv-S45A mutant fusion protein concentration in blood. In the experiment, the blood concentrations were assessed in three groups of four athymic FoxN1 Nu mice after administration of 1F5 [ 125I]scFv 4-SAv-S45A. Serial blood samples were obtained and counted to assess the blood concentrations. A logarithmic plot of the blood concentrations of 1F5 [ 125I]scFv 4SA-S45A in the three groups of mice, as a function of time, is provided in Figure 2 (data is provided as Table S1 in Supporting Information). One group of mice did not receive a blood-clearance agent (group 1, red line). Mice in the second and third groups received a single dose of either 1 or 2 given intravenously 24 hours after 1F5 [ 125I]scFv 4-SAv-S45A administration. Administration of the bis-biotin-trigalactose reagent, 2, removed 70% of 1F5 [ 125I]scFv 4-SAv-S45A from the bloodstream within 2 hours of injection (group 3, green line). However, only a 29% reduction in blood concentrations of 1F5 [ 125I]scFv 4-SAv-S45A was observed at the same time point when 1 was used (group 2, blue line) . Similar blood clearance data was obtained in mice administered the fusion protein, 1F5 [ 125I]scFv 4-SAv-Y43A (data not shown). Biodistributions of [ 111In]3b or [ 111In]4b in tumor-bearing mice pretargeted with 1F5 scFv 4-SAv fusion proteins. A pretargeting experiment was conducted to determine if the new clearing agent 2 was effective in decreasing normal tissue concentrations of [ 111In]4b, and to determine if [ 111In]4b could be used in a pretargeting protocol to effectively target tumor xenografts in the presence of endogenous biotin. The biodistribution study did not include groups of mice on biotin-deficient diets when scFv 4-SAv mutant fusion proteins were administered, as no difference in tumor concentrations were seen previously in pretargeting experiments using the same fusion proteins in mice placed on biotin-deficient diets or standard diets (22). In the pretargeting experiment, four groups of female FoxN1 NU athymic nude mice (5 mice/ group) bearing Ramos lymphoma xenografts were administered the fusion proteins (FP), blood clearance agents (CA) and radiolabeled biotin derivatives (RB) as depicted in Scheme 6. Group 1 was fed a biotin-deficient diet and groups 2 through 4 were fed standard diets. Twenty hours after anti-CD20 fusion protein administration, the mice received a blood clearing agent, either 1 or 2, followed 4 hours later by either [ 111In]3b or [ 111In]4b. Mice were sacrificed 24 hours after administration of [ 111In]3b or [ 111In]4b, and selected tissues were harvested. The tissues were counted in a gamma counter, and the concentration of 111In in each tissue was calculated as %ID/g. A bar graph showing the concentrations in tumor xenografts and selected tissues is provided as Figure 3 (data is provided as Table S2 in Supporting Information). An additional biodistribution study was conducted in athymic mice injecting [ 111In]4b alone. In that biodistribution, the only tissue that had more than 1% ID/g was kidney (1.57 \u00a1\u00be 0.10, 1.54 \u00a1\u00be 0.11 and 1.03 \u00a1\u00be 0.20 at 1, 4 and 24 h pirespectively), and most tissue concentrations were less than 0.2 %ID/g (Table S3 in Supporting Information). Figure 3 shows the dramatic effect that endogenous biotin can have on tumor concentrations of radiolabeled biotin in pretargeting protocols. The tumor and tissue concentrations after administration of wild-type SAv fusion protein (1F5 scFv 4-SAv-WT), the blood clearance agent 1 and 111In-labeled DOTA-biotin, [ 111In]3b are represented as groups 1 (red bars) and 2 (blue bars). Significant tumor concentrations (8.6 \u00a1\u00be 1.2% ID/g) of [ 111In]3b were obtained when the mice were fed biotin-free diets (group 1), whereas when mice were on normal diets (group 2) the concentrations of [ 111In]3b in tumor (0.25 \u00a1\u00be 0.1 %ID/g) were very low, indicating that little or no tumor targeting was attained. Furthermore, the substitution of 2 for 1, or [ 111In]4b for [ 111In]3b did not significantly change the concentration of radioactivity in tumor xenografts when pretargeted with 1F5 scFv 4SA-WT (data not shown). In contrast, pretargeting using the SAv mutant fusion proteins, scFv 4-SAv-S45A or scFv 4-Y43A, in mice fed a standard diet exhibited high concentrations of radioactivity (8.52 \u00a1\u00be 4.4% ID/g and 6.71 \u00a1\u00be 1.3% ID/g, respectively) in tumor xenografts. These results demonstrate that the blocking of radiolabeled biotin by endogenous biotin observed with the 1F5-SAv-WT can be overcome by using the lower affinity SAv mutants. The tissue concentrations of [ 111In]3b and [ 111In]4b were of a similar magnitude for the three fusion proteins, except in the blood and liver. The blood concentrations in the groups administered SAv mutant fusion proteins, scFv 4-SAv-S45A and scFv 4-SAv-Y43A, were much higher (0.18 \u00a1\u00be 0.06 %ID/g and 0.58 \u00a1\u00be 0.13 %ID/g) than in the groups administered scFv4-SAv-WT (0.008 \u00a1\u00be 0.002 %ID/g and 0.004 \u00a1\u00be 0.001 %ID/g), indicating that CA 2 was less efficient at clearing the SAv mutant fusion proteins than CA 1 was with the SAv WT fusion protein. Similarly, liver concentrations in the groups administered SAv mutant fusion proteins, scFv 4-SAv-S45A and scFv 4-SAv-Y43A, were somewhat higher (1.77 \u00a1\u00be 0.4% ID/g and 3.99 \u00a1\u00be 0.8% ID/g, respectively) than were obtained in groups administered the scFv 4-SAv-WT fusion protein (0.43 \u00a1\u00be 0.1% ID/g and 0.36 \u00a1\u00be 0.18 %ID/g). DISCUSSION. The ultimate goal of our studies is to develop a pretargeting protocol based on the streptavidin/biotin binding pair that provides good tumor targeting of therapeutic radionuclides in the presence of endogenous biotin, while having minimal localization of the radionuclides in normal tissues. Although endogenous biotin has not precluded the use of antibody-streptavidin conjugates or fusion proteins in clinical studies (33), it has the potential to significantly diminish the blood clearance and tumor targeting of the radiolabeled biotin derivatives in patients. In the pretargeting approach being investigated, a recombinant tetrameric fusion protein, combining the scFv portion of the anti-CD20 antibody 1F5 with streptavidin mutants that have decreased binding for biotin, is used in combination with a bis-biotin derivative that is radiolabeled with a diagnostic or therapeutic radionuclide. Due to its bivalency, bis-biotin derivatives have higher binding avidities than biotin, allowing their preferential binding with SAv mutants in the presence of endogenous biotin. The SAv mutants used in this investigation have a serine or tyrosine in the biotin-binding pocket replaced with an alanine residue (S45A and Y43A, respectively, (17)). In initial proof-of-principle studies, the SAv-Y43A mutant was found to have a 67-fold lower affinity for biotin than the wild-type (WT) SAv, and the off-rate for the bis-biotin was found to be 640 times slower than biotin when binding SAv-Y43A (21). This combination of reagents was previously found to target radionuclides to lymphoma xenografts in the presence of endogenous biotin, but normal tissues had significant concentrations of the radionuclides (22). Thus, the primary goal of this investigation was to design and synthesize a galactose-containing bis-biotin reagent that would bind in vivo with a scFv 4-SAv fusion protein, such that more efficient blood clearance of the fusion proteins could be attained. In addition to preparation of an effective clearing agent, a bis-biotin derivative that could be radiolabeled with 111In and 90Y was prepared such that those radiometals could be used in the pretargeting protocols with mutant SAv fusion proteins. The majority of our pretargeting investigations have used the biotin-hexadecyl-galactosamine reagent, 1 (also referred to as N-acetylgalactosamine-biotin or NAGB) 4, to affect clearance of the wild-type SAv conjugates of, or fusion proteins with, antibodies. The asialoglycoprotein receptors, also referred to as Ashwell receptors, are hepatic plasma membrane receptors responsible for regulating the concentrations of circulating glycoproteins (34, 35). This regulation is controlled by removal of sialic acid termini on glycoproteins to expose terminal galactose residues, allowing binding with the asialoglycoprotein receptor. It has been shown that asialogycoproteins are bound to liver membranes by a saturable, calcium dependent process. Bis-biotin blood-clearance reagent 2 was designed to bind with SAv in antibody conjugates or fusion proteins in the blood, then bind with the asialoglycoprotein receptors in the liver to clear them from blood. The structure of 2 was designed based on information provided in several literature reports. Studies by Lee et al. reported that conjugation of different monosacharides to proteins resulted in varying binding affinities with isolated rabbit liver membranes (36). In those studies it was demonstrated that proteins conjugated with thio-D-galactose moieties were effective at inhibiting binding of a standard, [ 125I]iodo-asialoorosomucoid ([ 125I]ASOR). Indeed, depending on the number of thio-D-galactosyl moieties conjugated, measured relative inhibitory power (RIP) values were as high as 10,000\u00a1\u00bf the [ 125I]ASOR. The studies also demonstrated that a 9-atom linker between the sugar and protein provided a higher RIP then when there was a 2 or 5 atom linker. Those early studies set a basis for the use of galactosyl conjugates for removal of proteins from blood using the asialoglycoprotein receptors, and began to define some of the structural requirements of the conjugates for efficient binding. The difficulty in synthesizing a bis-biotin counterpart to the large clearing agent 1 led us to consider whether the 16 galactosyl moieties were required for effective blood clearance. There are literature reports suggesting that as few as three galactosyl moieties may be effective. In early studies, Lee recognized that a number of biological systems require clustering of glycosides for biological activity, and that such clustering was often obtained from branched structures, so he prepared a number of tri-glucose and tri-galactose derivatives for study (37). Evaluation of mono-, bis-, and tris-galactosyl derivatized bovine serum albumin binding with rabbit liver membrane demonstrated that the tris-galactosyl conjugates were better at inhibiting binding of [ 125I]ASOR than the bis-galactose conjugate, which was better than the mono-galactose conjugate (38). In another study, Lee et al. demonstrated that the number of branched galactose moieties provided dramatic differences in inhibitory potency, with tetra- > tris->bis->mono (39). The 50% inhibitory value was ~ 1 mM for the mono-galactose conjugate, whereas it was ~1 nM for the tri-galactose conjugate. This large difference in binding inhibition based on the number of galactose residue in branched chains was also noted by Bezouska et al. (40). It was noted by Baenziger and Maynard that the galactose residues may bind two sites simultaneously, and speculated that the sites might be 25?30A apart (41). In a later study, Lee et al. synthesized \u00a1\u00b0cluster ligands\u00a1\u00b1 with 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 terminal galactose moieties (42). They found that the highest binding was obtained with the highest number of galactose moieties (i.e. 6 moieties), but that the binding affinity increased only a modest amount for the compounds containing 4 or 6 galactose moieties relative to the high binding of the compound that had 3 galactose moieties in a \u00a1\u00b0flexible\u00a1\u00b1 structure. Based on their results, it was hypothesized that there are three galactose-binding sites in the asialoglycoprotein receptor, and that the binding occurs in a triangle configuration with distances between binding sites of 15, 22 and 25A. Some years later, Biessen et al. added hydrophilic polyethylene glycol spacers of varying lengths (4, 9, 10, 13 & 20A) between galactose moieties and the branch point in trigalactose derivatives (or 38A between anomeric oxygen atoms on galactose residues), and evaluated their competitive binding vs. [ 125I]ASOR to isolated parenchymal liver cells (43). They found that the binding affinity of the tri-galactose cluster compounds was strongly correlated with the length of the spacer between the galactosyl residues and the branching point of the galactoside, with a factor of 2000\u00a1\u00bf higher affinity with the 20A spacer vs. the 4A spacer. The information from the literature provided the basis for the structure of galactose-containing portion of 2. Our previous studies demonstrating successful in vivo targeting of tumor xenografts with a radioiodinated bis-biotin derivative led us to retain the main structural features of that portion of the compound. Those structural features included; (1) appropriate functional groups to provide a distance between biotin carboxyate carbonyl functionalities of ~40A, (2) carboxylate groups on the carbon alpha to the biotinamide functionalities, (3) diamino-dioxaoctane spacer arms to increase aqueous solubility of compound. The distance between biotin moieties was chosen as the distance that was adequate to readily bind the two biotin-binding pockets on one face of the streptavidin mutants (19). The addition of the carboxylates alpha to the biotinamide provided protection from in vivo cleavage of the biotinamide bonds by the enzyme biotinidase (28). The structural properties that were previously shown to bind asialoglycoprotein receptors in liver were combined with the bis-biotin structural properties desired for binding with streptavidin mutants to design blood clearance agent 2. An investigation of pretargeting using bis-biotin derivatives 2 and [ 111In]4b was conducted in mice. The quantities of bis-biotin clearing agent 2 (5.8 nmol) and radiolabeled bis-biotin [ 111In]4b (1.2 nmol) used in this investigation were the same as in the previous studies employing fusion proteins constructed with wild-type (WT) SAv, the NAGB clearing agent, 1, and radiolabeled DOTA-biotin, [ 111In]3b. The quantity of those reagents and the times for their administration were optimized in a series of experiments (18, 44). Those optimization studies were not repeated in this investigation, instead a limited series of experiments varying the doses of mutant SAv fusion protein and 2 within a more narrow range were conducted. Those studies verified that the quantities previously optimized also worked optimally with the new reagents. A blood clearance study demonstrated that the fusion protein 1F5 [ 125I]scFv4-S45A could be more efficiently cleared from blood in mice after administration of 2 than when 1 was administered. This is shown in Figure 2. Importantly, use of 2 in a pretargeting study, where both 1F5 scFv4-SAv-S45A and 1F5 scFv4-SAv-Y43A fusion proteins (in separate groups) were evaluated with bis-biotin [ 111In]4b, resulted in normal tissue concentrations that were much lower than obtained in our previous pretargeting studies employing those fusion proteins with CA 1 and a radioiodinated bis-biotin derivative. The tissue concentration data obtained in the pretargeting study are shown as a bar graph in Figure 3. The most striking differences between [ 111In]4b and [ 111In]3b concentrations in tissues were found in the blood and liver. The higher blood concentrations are most likely brought about by less efficient blood clearance using 2, however, it is unclear why the liver concentrations of [ 111In]4b are somewhat higher. There may be several possible contributing factors to the observed differences in liver concentrations. For example, a contributing factor may be the difference in the nature of the galactose derivative in the clearing agents, 1 and 2. In 1 the galactose derivative is an N-acetyl-galactosamine moiety, whereas in 2 it is a galactose moiety. Although most literature relating to developing ligands for binding to asialoglycoprotein receptor are directed at galactose derivatives, it has been reported that the avidity of agents with terminal N-acetylgalactosamine moieties is greater than those terminated with galactose moieties (41). Indeed, studies have shown that tris-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine derivatives can have subnanomolar binding with the asialoglycoprotein receptor (45). Another possible contributing factor is higher denticity (i.e. more galactosamine residues), which could increase the rate of cell internalization (20). Yet another possible contributing factor is the binding avidity of the bis-biotin with the mutant fusion protein. It seems likely that the difference in binding of 1 with the mutant proteins contributes to the higher liver concentrations, as the liver concentration of [ 111In]4b at the time of sacrifice was about 2\u00a1\u00bf higher when the fusion protein 1F5 scFv 4-SAv-Y43A was used than when 1F5 scFv 4-SAv-S45A was used. It is not possible to determine the reason for the differences in liver concentrations with the data obtained, particularly with the complexity of the internalization process (46) and receptor/ligand recycling that has been observed (47, 48). Further studies need to be conducted to understand which parameters affect the observed higher liver concentrations. In conclusion, the pretargeting approach using a combination of SAv mutant fusion proteins, bis-biotin-trigalactose blood clearance agent 2, and 111In-labeled DOTA-bis-biotin, [ 111In]4b, was found to target lymphoma tumor xenografts in high concentrations, resulting in far superior biodistributions compared with the 1F5 scFv 4-SAv-WT conjugate system in the presence of endogenous biotin. While the new blood clearance agent, 2, has been shown to greatly decrease the radioactivity concentrations in most normal tissues relative to CA 1, the fact that higher blood and liver concentrations were obtained indicates that the structure of 2 is not optimal. Optimization of the structure of 2 might include use of N-acetylgalactosamine residues in the place of galactose residues, and incorporation of higher number of galactosamine residues (i.e. 4?6). While CA 2 is not optimized, we believe the results obtained are adequate to support investigation of 2 and 4a in pretargeting therapy studies using scFv 4-SAv mutant fusion proteins in tumor-bearing mice fed standard diets.

                "text": "BRAF Mutation-selective Inhibition of Thyroid Cancer Cells by the Novel MEK Inhibitor RDEA119 and Genetic-potentiated Synergism with the mTOR Inhibitor Temsirolimus\tWe examined the therapeutic potential of a novel MEK inhibitor, RDEA119, and its synergism with the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus in thyroid cancer cell lines. RDEA119 potently inhibited the proliferation of the four cell lines that harbored BRAF mutation, but had no or modest effects on the other four cells that harbored wild-type BRAF (IC 50 of 0.034 ? 0.217 \u00a5\u00ecM vs. 1.413 ? 34.120 \u00a5\u00ecM). This inhibitory effect of RDEA119 in selected cell lines OCUT1 (BRAF V600E +, PIK3CA H1047R +) and SW1376 (BRAF V600E +) was enhanced by combination with the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus. The PTEN-deficient cell FTC133 was highly sensitive to temsirolimus but insensitive to RDEA119 and simultaneous treatment with the latter enhanced the sensitivity of the cell to the former. The KAT18 (wild-type) cell was not sensitive to either drug alone, but became sensitive to the combination of the two drugs. The drug synergy was confirmed by combination index and isobologram analyses. RDEA119 and temsirolimus also showed synergistic effects on autophagic death of OCUT1 and KAT18 cells selectively tested. Dramatic synergistic effects of the two drugs were also seen on the growth of FTC133 xenograft tumors in nude mice. Overall, the effects of the two drugs on cell proliferation or autophagic death, either alone or in combination, were more pronounced in cells that harbored genetic alterations in the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways. Thus, these results demonstrated the important therapeutic potential of the novel MEK inhibitor RDEA119 and its synergism with temsirolimus in thyroid cancer. Introduction. Follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy with a rapidly rising incidence in recent years 1 , 2. This cancer is histologically classified into papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). Although surgical and radioiodine treatments are generally effective, many thyroid cancer patients have persistent disease that is currently incurable and associated with increased morbidity and mortality 3 , 4. The Ras \u00a1\u00e6 Raf \u00a1\u00e6 MEK\u00a1\u00e6 MAP kinase/ERK signaling pathway (MAPK pathway) plays an important role in thyroid tumorigenesis and progression of thyroid cancer, particularly the aggressive and incurable types 5 ? 7. Unique of thyroid cancer with respect to the signaling of this pathway is the high prevalence of the activating BRAF mutation in this pathway, particularly in PTC and ATC 8. Several clinical trials have been completed testing the therapeutic effects of targeting this pathway at various levels, such as MEK and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), using several inhibitors 9 ? 12. Although these studies have opened an exciting new era of translational thyroid cancer research, the clinical effectiveness of the drugs tested was generally limited, raising question on the effectiveness of targeting single pathways. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) \u00a1\u00e6 Akt \u00a1\u00e6 mTOR signaling pathway (PI3K/Akt pathway) also plays an important role in thyroid tumorigenesis 6 , 7. Blocking the PI3K signaling pathway with pharmacologically toxic (clinically inapplicable) agents resulted in suppression of thyroid cancer cells 13 , 14. Moreover, our and others\u00a1\u00af studies demonstrated that genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway were common in thyroid cancer, particularly in FTC and ATC 15 ? 18. We recently further showed that genetic alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases and in their coupled MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways occurred in nearly all cases of ATC, the most aggressive type of thyroid cancer, with the majority of the cases harboring genetic alterations that could potentially simultaneously activate MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways 19. These results suggest that dual involvement of the two pathways is a fundamental mechanism in the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of thyroid cancer and thus simultaneously targeting the two pathways may be particularly effective for the treatment of thyroid cancer. In the present study, we explored the therapeutic potential of a novel MEK inhibitor, RDEA119, and its synergism with the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus, which are both clinically applicable, in the inhibition of thyroid cancer cells. Materials and Methods. Cell lines and reagents. The thyroid cancer cell line OCUT1 was originally from Dr. Naoyoshi Onoda (Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan); K1 from Dr. David Wynford-Thomas (University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK); BCPAP from Dr. Massimo Santoro (University of Federico II, Naples, Italy); SW1736 and Hth74 from Dr. N.E. Heldin (University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden); FTC133 from Dr. Georg Brabant (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK); KAT18 from Dr. Kenneth B. Ain (University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY), and WRO-82-1 from Dr. G. J. F. Juillard (University of California-Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA). They were all grown at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% human serum, except for FTC133 that was cultured with DMEM/HAM\u00a1\u00afS F-12 medium with 5% human serum. RDEA119 was obtained from Ardea Biosciences (San Diego, CA), and temsirolimus were obtained from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (Madison, NJ). The cell culture medium and agents were replenished every 24 h during the treatment. Western blotting analysis. Western blotting analysis was performed according to standard procedures as we described previously 20. The antibodies used in the present study, including anti-phospho-ERK (Sc-7383), anti-ERK1 (Sc-94), anti-phospho-Akt (Sc-7985-R), anti-phospho-p70S6 Kinase (p70S6K) (Sc-7985-R), anti-actin (Sc-1616-R), HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit (Sc-2004), and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (Sc-2005) IgG antibodies, were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the chemilucent ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Cell proliferation assay. Cell proliferation assay was performed in triplicate for each experiment as previously described 20. Briefly, cells (800/well) were seeded into 96-well plates and treated with different drugs at indicated concentrations. After 5 days of treatments, cell culture was added with 10 \u00a5\u00ecl of 5 mg/ml MTT [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] and incubated for 4 h, followed by addition of 100 \u00a5\u00ecl of 10% SDS solution and a further incubation overnight. The plates were read using the test wavelength of 570 nm and the reference wavelength of 670 nm. IC 50 values were calculated using the Reed-Muench method. Analysis of combined drug effects. Drug synergy was determined by the combination-index and isobologram analyses, which were generated according to the median-effect method of Chou and Talalay using the CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO) 21. The combination-index (CI) is a quantitative representation of the degree of drug interaction. On the basis of the dose-response curves using MTT assay for thyroid cancer cells treated with inhibitors, alone or combination, the CI values were generated over a range of fraction affected (Fa) levels from 5% ? 95% growth inhibition. Synergism, additivity, and antagonism are defined as CI < 1, CI = 1, and CI > 1, respectively. The isobologram is formed by plotting the individual drug concentrations required to achieve 50% inhibitory effect on their respective x- and y- axes. A straight line connecting the two points is drawn and the concentration (combination data point) of the two drugs used in combination to achieve the 50% inhibitory effect is plotted on the isobologram. Combination data points that fall on the line represent an additive drug, whereas data points that fall below or above the line represent synergism and antagonism, respectively. Cell autophagy analysis. Cells were transfected with GFP-LC3 expression plasmid EGFP-LC3B (Addgene Inc, Cambridge, MA). At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with or without 1 \u00a5\u00ecM RDEA19 and/or 100 nM temsirolimus for 48 h. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged using fluorescence microscopy. Hoechst 33342 counter-stain was used to identify cells with intact nuclei. Autophagy was reflected by GFP-LC3B redistribution to form puncta, which would represent the autophagic vacuoles. Cells with more than four GFP-LC3B puncta per cell were regarded as autophagic cells as described previously 22. Five random fields representing 200 GFP-LC3-positive cells were counted and the percentage of cells with punctuate staining was determined in three independent experiments 22. Microscope photos were captured using Spot image software (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Xenograft tumor assay in nude mice. An aliquot of 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 FTC133 cells was injected subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, Inc). When tumors grew to about 5 mm in diameter, animals were grouped into 4 groups (4 mice/group) that have similar average tumor size. RDEA119 was prepared in vehicle 1 (10% cremohor EL in saline), and was administered through oral gavage twice/day (5 mg/kg). Temsirolimus was formulated in vehicle 2 containing 2% ethanol and 8% cremophor, and administered through intraperitoneal injection once/3 days (10 mg/kg). The four groups were treated with vehicle 1 plus vehicle 2 (control), temsirolimus plus vehicle 1 (temsirolimus group), RDEA119 plus vehicle 2 (RDEA119 group) or RDEA119 plus temsirolimus (combination group), respectively. Tumor size was measured on the skin surface twice a week and tumor volumes were calculated by the formula (width) 2 \u00a1\u00bf length/2 as described previously 23. Tumors were harvested and weighed after treatment for two weeks. Statistical analysis of differences in tumor volumes and weights between groups was performed using the two-tailed Independent-sample T test. Results. The novel MEK inhibitor RDEA119 selectively inhibited the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells with genetic alterations in the MAPK pathway. We first tested the effect of the novel MEK inhibitor RDEA119 on the activities of MAPK pathway and cell proliferation of eight thyroid cancer cell lines, which had different genotypes of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways (Table 1). In one selected cell line, SW1736, which harbored heterozygous BRAF mutation, RDEA119 suppressed the MAPK pathway in a concentration-dependent manner. As shown in Fig 1A, remarkable inhibition of ERK phosphorylation was achieved by treatment with 0.2 \u00a5\u00ecM RDEA119 and complete inhibition was achieved at 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecM. The inhibitory effect remained for at least 24 h (Fig 1B). Treatment with RDEA119 for 24 h had similar effects on ERK phosphorylation in OCUT1, K1 and BCPAP cells that harbored T1799A BRAF mutation. RDEA119 showed moderate inhibitory effects on FTC133, KAT18, Hth74 and WRO cells that did not harbor BRAF mutation (Fig 1C). We next examined the effect of RDEA119 on the proliferation of these cells. As shown in Fig 1D and Table 1, RDEA119 potently inhibited the proliferation of BRAF mutation-harboring cells OCUT1, K1, BCPAP and SW1736 in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC 50 values ranging from 0.034 ? 0.217 \u00a5\u00ecM. In contrast, this MEK inhibitor showed no or very modest inhibitory effects in FTC133, KAT18, Hth74, and WRO cells that did not harbor BRAF mutation, with IC 50 values ranging from 1.413 ? 34.12 \u00a5\u00ecM (Fig 1D and Table 1). Thus, these results demonstrated a BRAF mutation-selective inhibition of thyroid cancer cells by the novel MEK inhibitor RDEA119. The MEK inhibitor RDEA119 and mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus synergistically inhibited the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells. As genetic alterations in both the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways play a fundamental role in the tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer 6 , 7, we asked whether simultaneously targeting the two pathways would have synergetic effects on the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of combined use of the MEK inhibitor RDEA119 and the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus were tested in four representative thyroid cancer cell lines, including OCUT1 harboring both BRAF and PIK3CA mutations, SW1736 harboring only BRAF mutation, FTC133 harboring deficient PTEN, and KAT18 cells with wild-type alleles. These cells were chosen for their representative genotypes in the two pathways. Fig 2 shows the effects of drug combination on MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Temsirolimus and RDEA119 inhibited the phosphorylation of p70S6K and ERK, respectively, and their combination inhibited the phosphorylation of both. Interestingly, RDEA119 also showed an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of p70S6K in OCUT1 and SW1736 cells. Temsirolimus increased Akt phosphorylation to various extents in the four cell lines, especially in SW1736 cells, consistent with the known feedback effect of mTOR inhibitors on Akt activation 23. Combination with RDEA119 interestingly blocked this feedback effect in SW1736 cells (Fig 2). We next tested the effects of drug combination on cell proliferation. As shown in the upper panel of Fig 3A, the PIK3CA mutation-harboring OCUT1 cells showed a higher sensitivity to the inhibition by temsirolimus than SW1736 cells. This can also be seen in the isobologram in the lower panel of Fig 3A in which the marked points on the x-axis represent IC 50 values of temsirolimus for the four cells. This is consistent with the results we reported recently 20. In both cells, temsirolimus enhanced the already remarkable inhibitory effects of RDEA119. The PTEN-deficient cell FTC133 was highly sensitive to temsirolimus but only minimally sensitive to RDEA119. Simultaneous treatment with the two inhibitors resulted in enhanced inhibition of the cell (Fig 3A). Also consistent with our previous finding 20 was that KAT18 cells were less sensitive than OCUT1 cells and FTC133 cells, particularly the latter, to temsirolimus. Combination of RDEA119 and temsirolimus also had a synergistic effect on the KAT18 cell, but the overall magnitude of inhibition was lower compared with other cells that harbored genetic alterations in the MAPK or PI3K/Akt pathways (Fig 3A). The SW1736 and KAT18 cells do not have known genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, but the latter was more sensitive than the former to temsirolimus (Fig 3), raising the possibility of the existence of a molecular mechanism unique to the KAT18 cells. To more clearly analyze the level of interaction (synergistic, additive or antagonistic) between RDEA119 and temsirolimus, the combination-index (CI) and isobologram were calculated according to the Chou and Talalay median effect principal 21. The CI values for each dose combination of the two drugs are shown in the middle panel of Fig 3A. Synergy between RDEA119 and temsirolimus was observed in at least 5 different does combination in the four thyroid cancer cell lines, with most of the CI values being less than 0.5, suggesting a synergism. The results of isobologram analysis, which reflect the whole interaction level, are shown in the lower panel of Fig 3A. The combination data points for all the cells were below the lines connecting the IC 50 points of the two drugs. The results thus again revealed strong synergistic effects between RDEA119 and temsirolimus on the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells. RDEA119 and temsirolimus synergistically induced autophagic death of thyroid cancer cells. Increasing evidence indicates that deficiency of autophagy, known as non-apoptotic programmed cell death, is involved in tumorigenesis and mTOR inhibitors induce cell autophagy in various cancer cell lines 24 ? 26. We therefore examined whether REDA119 and temsirolimus could synergistically induce autophagy as one mechanism for their effects on proliferation of thyroid cancer cells. As shown in Fig 3B and C, RDEA119 and temsirolimus, when used individually, slightly induced autophagy in OCUT1 cells that harbored genetic alterations (BRAF and PIK3CA mutations) in both the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways. Remarkably, combination of the two drugs dramatically increased autophagy of OCUT1 cells. Slight autophagy of KAT18 cells occurred when treated with RDEA119 or temsirolimus alone, and combination treatment caused a modest increase in autophagy in this cell that harbored wild-type genotypes in the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. RDEA119 and temsirolimus synergistically inhibited thyroid xenograft tumor growth in vivo. We also examined the effects of RDEA119 and temsirolimus on the growth of xenograft tumors derived from FTC133 cells, which were previously shown to be well compatible with the nude mice 20. As shown in Fig 4A, while temsirolimus significantly inhibited the xenograft growth, RDEA119 only had a modest effect. This is consistent with the in vitro proliferation data that FTC133 cells were far more sensitive to temsirolimus than RDEA119 (Fig 3A). Combination of RDEA119 and temsirolimus resulted in a more pronounced inhibition of the xenograft tumors and, in fact, tumor growth was nearly completely suspended. At two weeks of treatment, the average tumor volumes of the combination group was 0.34 \u00a1\u00be 0.23 cm 3, which was significantly smaller than that of control (3.40 \u00a1\u00be 1.35 cm 3, p = 0.004), temsirolimus group (0.96 \u00a1\u00be 0.38 cm 3, p = 0.03) and RDEA119 group (1.73 \u00a1\u00be 0.81 cm 3, p = 0.02), respectively. The tumor weight of each individual mouse at the end of the treatment is shown in Fig 4B. The average tumor weight of the combination group was 0.55 \u00a1\u00be 0.28 g, which was significantly smaller than that of control (2.90 \u00a1\u00be 0.93 g, p = 0.002) and RDEA119 group (1.81 \u00a1\u00be 0.75 g, p = 0.02), respectively. It was marginally smaller than that of the temsirolimus group (1.15 \u00a1\u00be 0.54 cm 3, p = 0.09). Discussion. RDEA119 is a novel and unique MEK inhibitor that has been developed recently with great promise as an anti-cancer drug for its favorable properties, including easy oral dosing, excellent selectivity for MEK and low central nervous system penetration (hence low neurological toxicity) 27. It is currently in clinical trials in advanced cancer patients as both monotreatment and combinative therapy with the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib. In the present preclinical study, we for the first time tested the effects of RDEA119 and, taking a further step, the effects of combined use of RDEA119 and the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus on thyroid cancer cells. Like other MEK inhibitors tested previously, many of which may not be clinically applicable 28 ? 33, we demonstrated the BRAF mutation selectivity of the novel MEK inhibitor RDEA119. We also demonstrated that RDEA119 and temsirolimus had significant synergism in inhibiting the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells in vitro and the growth of xenograft thyroid tumors in vivo. Like the BRAF mutation-selective effects of the MEK inhibitor RDEA119 on thyroid cancer cells, the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus also showed more potent inhibition on cells (OCUT1 and FTC133) that harbored genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway. This is consistent with our recent report that genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway conferred thyroid cancer cells sensitivity to the inhibitors of this pathway 20. Interestingly, in the present study, we demonstrated that RDEA119 and temsirolimus, when used in combination, showed synergistic effects on cell proliferation in all cell lines, including cells that had wild genotypes in the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. However, inhibition of cells by combined use of RDEA119 and temsirolimus was most effective in cells that harbored genetic alterations in the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, particularly in cells that harbored genetic alterations in both pathways, and least in cells that had wild genotypes in both pathways. This genetic-selective pattern was also clearly seen in the synergistic effects of RDEA119 and temsirolimus on autophagic death of thyroid cancer cells (Fig. 3B), which can explain the synergistic inhibitory effects of the two drugs on thyroid cancer cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. These findings have important therapeutic implications for thyroid cancer, particularly for aggressive and currently incurable thyroid cancers that commonly harbored activating genetic alterations in both the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways 19. Simultaneously targeting the two pathways using RDEA119 and temsirolimus may be particularly effective for the treatment of these cancers. No significant cell apoptosis was induced by the MEK and mTOR inhibitors in the present study (data not shown). Therefore, unlike autophagic cell death, apoptosis may not be a major mechanism involved in the synergistic inhibition of thyroid cancer cells by the MEK and mTOR inhibitors. A recent study published during the revision of the present paper also showed enhanced inhibition of thyroid cancer cells by combined use of a MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, and a mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin 34. Although combination index and isobologram were not examined in this study for synergism analysis, the results are consistent with our findings. It would be interesting to know whether the effects of AZD6244 and rapamycin also involved autophagic cell death as a mechanism for the observed effects of the combined use of the two inhibitors since cell apoptosis was also not observed in this study. In terms of pharmaceutical properties and toxicity profiles, rapamycin may be inferior to its derivative newer generations of mTOR inhibitors, such as temsirolimus. We previously also demonstrated a synergistic inhibition of thyroid cancer cells by the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 32. However, these inhibitors are unlikely to be clinically applicable. Therefore, future clinical trial designing on combination therapy targeting both the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways for thyroid cancer may reasonably use temsirolimus and a clinically applicable MEK inhibitor, such as RDEA119 or AZD6244. In summary, this study demonstrated the therapeutic potential of the novel MEK inhibitor RDEA119 in thyroid cancer and its synergism with the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus. This seemed to be the case particularly in thyroid cancer cells that harbored genetic alterations in MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. Given the extremely common genetic alterations in the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways in thyroid cancer, particularly aggressive and currently incurable thyroid cancers, combination therapy using RDEA119 and temsirolimus may prove to be effective in tackling these cancers. Given the good clinical applicability of RDEA119 and temsirolimus, clinical trials on combination therapy using the two drugs in thyroid cancer may be warranted. Acknowledgments. We thank Drs.

                "text": "BMS-690514, a VEGFR and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, shows anti-tumoural activity on non-small-cell lung cancer xenografts and induces sequence-dependent synergistic effect with radiation\t Background:. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an aggressive disease in which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are implicated in tumour growth, tumour resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, and disease relapse. We have investigated the anti-tumoural effects of BMS-690514, an inhibitor of both vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathways, as a single agent and in combination with ionising radiation (IR) on several NSCLC cell lines.  Methods:. Radiosensitisation of several NSCLC cell lines by BMS-690514 was assessed in vitro using clonogenic assay and in vivo using nude mice.  Results:. In vitro studies showed that BMS-690514 alone decreases clonogenic survival of NSCLC cells lines but no potential enhancement of IR response was observed in the combination. In tumour-bearing mice, BMS-690514 alone inhibits the growth of NSCLC xenografts, including the T790M mutation-harbouring H1975 tumour. The concomitant combination of BMS-690514 and radiation did not increase mice survival in comparison with treatment with IR alone. In contrast, BMS-690514 markedly enhances the anti-tumour effect of radiation in a sequential manner on H1299 and H1975 xenografts. Immunohistochemistry revealed a qualitative reduction in vessel area after administrations of BMS-690514, compared with vehicle-treated controls, suggesting that revascularisation may explain the schedule dependency of the tumour-growth delay observed.  Conclusion:. The results of association with radiation show that BMS-690514 may be a successful adjuvant to clinical radiotherapy. These findings are of translational importance because the clinical benefits of anti-EGFR and anti-VEGFR therapy might be schedule dependent. Lung cancer is a major health problem worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer-related death for men and women (Alberg et al, 2005). Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of lung cancer and patients typically present with locally advanced or metastatic disease (Toschi et al, 2007). Currently, treatment options for a patient with locally advanced lung cancer include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or surgery (Fossella et al, 2003). Unfortunately, recent studies demonstrate that conventional therapies lead to a poor outcome, with a 5-year survival rate for NSCLC that remains at 15% (Toschi et al, 2007). Hence, the current therapeutic challenge is to optimise non-operative strategies by incorporating new agents into current therapeutic regimens. Targeting the tumour vasculature with anti-angiogenic agents in combination with radiotherapy is one current strategy (O'Reilly, 2006). Inhibiting the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway is another promising approach for improving the anti-tumoural activity of radiation. A pivotal study reported a benefit in overall survival and locoregional control in patients with localised head and neck cancer who were treated with both radiation and cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), over patients treated with radiation alone (Bonner et al, 2006). Several studies demonstrated that angiogenesis and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other pro-angiogenic factors and their receptors correlate with a less favourable clinical outcome for lung cancer patients; yet clinical trials of agents that target these pathways alone have been disappointing (Bremnes et al, 2006). Preclinical studies suggest that monotherapy with anti-angiogenic agents will not be sufficient for the treatment of advanced cancer (O'Reilly et al, 1994; Boehm et al, 1997), given that tumours typically progress before they respond to therapy and microscopic residual disease persists even after prolonged therapy with these agents. In clinical trials, bevacizumab, a humanised antibody against VEGF, has shown considerable promise and improved survival in patients with colorectal, breast, or lung cancer when used in combination with chemotherapy (Hurwitz et al, 2004; Miller et al, 2005; Sandler et al, 2006). Several findings argue in favour of combining radiation and an anti-angiogenic inhibitor (Senan and Smit, 2007). Radiation induces transient tumour hypoxia, which in turn stimulates VEGF production and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) expression (Gorski et al, 1999). Vascular endothelial growth factor protects endothelial cells from radiation-induced cytotoxicity (Kermani et al, 2001), and vasculature damage decreases tumour cell survival (Garcia-Barros et al, 2003). After radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, a subset of patients fail to achieve long-term local tumour control. Hypoxia or hypoxia-inducible factor-1 expression is associated with a lower radiation response and malignant progression in tumours of the uterine cervix, head and neck, as well as in sarcomas, suggesting that angiogenesis could be involved in radioresistance (Hirota and Semenza, 2006). Preclinical studies have demonstrated enhanced radiation-induced cell kill when anti-angiogenic therapy is combined with radiotherapy (Lee et al, 2000; Hess et al, 2001). The normalisation of tumour vasculature by an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody creates a time period of increased oxygenation, during which enhanced radiation-induced regression is observed (Winkler et al, 2004). Combination of anti-angiogenic therapies and radiotherapy may be effective against tumour stem cells that have self-renewing potential, quiescence of cell cycling, and relative resistance to growth factors (Baumann et al, 2008). We hypothesised that targeting both the tumour and its vasculature by VEGFR and EGFR blockade would improve lung cancer treatment, particularly when combined with radiation therapy. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the feasibility of combining radiation with BMS-690514, a potent, orally administrable inhibitor of VEGFR and EGFR tyrosine kinase activity that was shown to have in vitro anti-tumour activity against lung cancer cells in a panel of human NSCLC in vitro experiments (De La Motte Rouge et al, 2007). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of EGFR and VEGFR signalling inhibition on the response to radiotherapy, to determine whether scheduling of BMS-690514 and ionising radiation (IR) affected anti-tumour efficacy, to assess the influence of EGFR mutation on tumour response, and to investigate whether the effects of the treatments were related to changes in tumour perfusion and vasculature. In this study, we report that BMS-690514 has in vivo efficacy on a panel of NSLCC xenografts, including those with T790M mutations, conferring resistance to EGFR therapies such as Erlotinib or Gefitinib. Furthermore, adjuvant administration of BMS-690514 was able to markedly enhance tumour response to IR in vivo in H1299 and H1975 xenografts. Materials and methods.  Cell lines, culture, and treatments. A549 cells (wild-type (WT) EGFR and p53) were grown in F12-K medium containing L-glutamine, supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, 100Uml ?1 penicillin-G sodium, and 100\u00a5\u00ecgml ?1 streptomycin sulphate. H1299 cells (WT EGFR, inactive p53 R175H), H1650 cells (bearing a deletion in exon 19 of the EGFR gene, that is, \u00a5\u00c4E746?A750 and WT p53), and H1975 cells (EGFR L858R/T790M and WT p53) were maintained in RPMI 1640 with GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum and antibiotics (as above). Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and 5% CO 2. For in vitro experiments, BMS-690514 was dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide at 50\u00a5\u00ecmoll ?1 as a stock solution and stored at ?20\u00a1\u00c6C. For in vivo studies, BMS-690514 was prepared fresh before each administration. It was dissolved in 1,2-propanediol and Tween 80 to a final 1,2-propanediol concentration of 40% and Tween 80 concentration of 10%.  Clonogenic survival assays. First, a clonogenic assay was performed without irradiation and with various doses of BMS-690514 to demonstrate dose response and calculate the concentration of BMS-690514 to inhibit 50% of cells (IC50). To investigate the effect of BMS-690514 on the response of cell lines to radiation, a standard clonogenic assay was performed. Survival after radiation exposure was defined as the ability of cells to maintain clonogenic capacity and form colonies. Briefly, after incubation intervals of 12h with BMS-690514 at a dose ranging from 20 to 500nmoll ?1, cells were washed and exposed to radiation at a dose ranging from 2 to 6Gy using 200-kV X-rays, and then cells were trypsinised, counted, and seeded for colony formation in 35-mm dishes at 50?1000 cells per dish. After incubation intervals of 14 days, colonies were stained with crystal violet and manually counted. All colonies of 50 or more cells were then counted. The survival fraction (SF) was estimated according to the following formula: SF=number of colonies formed/number of cells seeded \u00a1\u00bf plating efficiency of the control group. All experiments were performed in triplicate.  Assay for tumour growth in athymic nude mice. In vivo experiments were carried out at the Institut Gustave Roussy under Animal Care license no 94-076-11 (Ministere de l'Agriculture). Female athymic nude mice (6?8 weeks of age) purchased from Janvier CERT (Le Genest St. Isle, France) were used. A549, H1975, and H1299 cells were collected in exponential growth phase and \u00a1\u00ad3 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells were injected s.c. into the flank area of 6- to 8-week-old female athymic nude mice on day 0. When tumours reached the appropriate size, mice were randomised into groups of six mice each and treated. Three separate animal experiments were performed: (a) BMS-690514 alone: Mice bearing tumours with a volume of 75?150mm 3 were randomly assigned to receive BMS-690514 (30mgkg ?1day ?1) or vehicle (1, 2-propanediol and Tween 80 in saline water). Treatment was administered once daily by oral gavage for 5 days. (b) BMS-690514+IR: For BMS-690514 and radiation studies, mice bearing established tumours of a volume of 75?150mm 3 were randomised into groups of six to orally receive either vehicle or BMS-690514 (30mgkg ?1 per os quaque die (every day) \u00a1\u00bf 5, \u00a1\u00bf 1 week) once daily for the duration of the experiment. BMS-690514 or vehicle was administered with or without irradiation (6Gy in a single administration on day 3). Localised irradiation was administered at a dose rate of 0.85Gymin ?1 using mouse jigs. (c) IR+adjuvant BMS-690514: For H1299 and H1975 xenografts, BMS-690514 was given the first day after IR at a dose of 6Gy, and from day 2 to day 12 according to a sequential schedule. Mice were weighed, and tumour size was measured twice a week with an electronic caliper. Individual mice were followed up over 30 days after the beginning of the treatment. Tumour volume was estimated from two-dimensional tumour measurements using the following formula: In each group (six mice per group), the relative tumour volume was expressed as the V t/V o ratio (V t as the mean tumour volume on a given day during the treatment and V o as the mean tumour volume at the beginning of the treatment). The experimental end point was taken as the time for the tumour to reach a relative tumour volume of five times that at the initiation of therapy (RTV5). When tumours reached RTV5, mice were killed. Overall survival was calculated using the Kaplan?Meier method. Growth delay was calculated by subtracting the average time for control tumours to grow five-fold in volume from the time required for treated tumours to increase in volume by the same amount from the first day of treatment.  Immunohistochemistry. Histological assessment was carried out to evaluate the effects of BMS-690514 on tumour vasculature. Three animals were killed after the 3-day treatment with BMS-690514. Tumours were excised and, after fixing them in Finefix (Milestone, Italy), paraffin sections (4-\u00a5\u00ecm thick) were prepared. After xylene treatment and rehydration, immunohistochemistry of anti-CD34-positive murine endothelial cells (HyCult Biotechnology b.v., Uden, The Netherlands) was performed. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was achieved with Tris?EDTA (pH 8) at 98\u00a1\u00c6C for 40min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by treatment with 3% H 2O 2 for 10min. The sections were placed in coverplates (Shandon, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA) and incubated with blocking serum Biogenex wash buffer (1:10 dilution; San Ramon, CA, USA) for 10min. This step was followed by incubation with anti-mouse CD34 (1:20 dilution) diluted in blocking serum (1:10 dilution) for 1h. Slides were then incubated with a rabbit anti-rat (1:400) (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL, USA) diluted in blocking serum (1:10 dilution). The following step was performed using a Rabbit PowerVision kit (ImmunoVision Technologies, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 20min and diaminobenzidine for 10min. Slides were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin and mounted with Pertex. Tumour necrosis was assessed by light microscopy. The number of microvessels per field was scored by averaging five field counts of three individual tumours for each group.  X-ray irradiation. A 200-kV X-ray irradiator was used at a dose rate of 0.85Gymin ?1. For in vivo irradiation, radiation was given using mouse jigs designed to expose only the tumour bed to radiation.  Statistical analysis. All descriptive statistics, including mean\u00a1\u00bes.d., were performed. A Student's t-test was used to evaluate differences between the control group and each treatment group in all in vitro studies. Kaplan?Meier curves were used for in vivo experiments and the log-rank test was used for statistical comparisons. Results. The VEGFR and EGFR inhibitor, BMS-690514, decreases the survival of NSCLC cells lines, regardless of the EGFR mutational status at submicromolar concentrations. The effect of BMS-690514 on the proliferation of four NSCLC cell lines was determined by clonogenic assay after a 12-h incubation with BMS-690514 at doses ranging from 5 to 500nmoll ?1. Clonogenic surviving fraction was significantly reduced in all cell lines including the EGFR mutation (T790M)-harbouring cell line (H1975), a mutation that confers resistance against erlotinib (Yun et al, 2008). This effect was obtained at an IC50 value of \u00a1\u00ad20nmoll ?1 for A549 and H1975 cell lines; at \u00a1\u00ad10nmoll ?1 for the H1650 cell line; and at \u00a1\u00ad40nmoll ?1 for the H1299 cell line (Figure 1), and was dose dependent. These data are consistent with those reported by a previous study that showed that these concentrations led to a significant decrease in EGFR phosphorylation (De la Motte Rouge et al, 2007).  IR cell killing is not affected by BMS-690514. No potential in vitro enhancement of radiation cell killing was observed with BMS-690514 in NSCLC cells at a dose of 20 (Figure 2) or 500nmoll ?1 (data not shown). Clonogenic survival was not different in the four NSCLC cell lines treated with BMS-690514, radiation, or both.  BMS-690514 alone inhibits growth of NSCLC xenograft regardless of EGFR mutational status. Continuous oral dosing of A549, H1299, and H1975 tumour-bearing mice with BMS-690514 for 5 days resulted in tumour growth inhibition. Figure 3A shows that BMS-690514 increases survival in A549 tumour-bearing mice (P=0.02), H1299 tumour-bearing mice (P=0.02), and H1975 tumour-bearing mice (P=0.1), compared with mice treated with vehicle. The time taken to reaching a relative A549 tumour volume equivalent to five times that at the start of the treatment (RTV5) was 40\u00a1\u00be12 days with BMS-690514 compared with 22\u00a1\u00be11 days with vehicle (P=0.02). Similar data were observed for H1299 tumour-bearing mice: RTV5 was 17\u00a1\u00be3.5 days with BMS-690514 compared with 9\u00a1\u00be1.2 days with vehicle (P=0.02). RTV5 was 23\u00a1\u00be5 days in H1975 tumour-bearing mice administered BMS-690514 compared with 14\u00a1\u00be4 days for mice treated with vehicle (P=0.15).  BMS-690514 has sequence-dependent synergistic anti-tumour activity with radiation. To evaluate the potent interaction between BMS-690514 and radiation, tumour-bearing mice were treated with either BMS-690514 or radiation, or both, in concomitant schedule. The potential of BMS-690514 to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in NSCLC xenografts was first investigated in a concurrent schedule, in which 30mgkg ?1 BMS-690514 was given orally once a day from day 1 to day 5 and 6-Gy radiation was administered at day 3. No increase in survival was observed in mice treated with both treatments (Figure 3B?D). While on a concurrent schedule, no enhancement of radiation was observed; BMS-690514 markedly enhances the anti-tumour effect of radiation in a sequential manner (Figure 4). H1299 xenograft-bearing mice, treated with a 30-mgkg ?1 oral dose of BMS-690514 from day 2 to day 12 after the completion of radiation (6Gy at day 1), exhibited a significant increase in survival (median survival=20 days), compared with mice treated with radiation alone (median survival=13.5 days, P=0.004) or BMS-690514 alone (median survival=14 days, P=0.07). Furthermore, the association leads to an increase in time to reach RTV5 as compared with mice treated with BM-690514 alone or radiation alone (Figure 5B). The association was well tolerated (Figure 5C). Sequential scheduling radiation followed by 30-mgkg ?1 BMS-690514 treatment for 12 days induced a mean body weight loss of 7%\u00a1\u00be2. This was not different from that induced by 12 days of treatment with 30-mgkg ?1 BMS-690514 alone. These results were also observed for H1975 xenograft-bearing mice: mice treated with a 30-mgkg ?1 oral dose of BMS-690514 from day 2 to day 12 after completion of radiation (6Gy at day 1) exhibited a significant increase in survival (median survival=20 days) compared with mice treated with radiation alone (median survival=14 days, P=0.005) or BMS-690514 alone (median survival=9 days, P=0.05).  BMS-690514 decreases vascularisation in xenografts. As shown in Figure 5, BMS-690514 could decrease vascularisation in H1299 xenografts as compared with untreated H1299 xenografts, suggesting an anti-angiogenic effect of BMS-690514. After 3 days of BMS-690514 administration (30mgkg ?1day ?1), the proportion of tumour vessels seemed to be lesser than that in vehicle-treated controls and a qualitative reduction in CD34-positive vessel area was observed. Discussion. Patients with locally advanced NSCLC have a poor outcome with a 5-year survival rate of 15%. As chemoradiotherapy for these patients has a modest impact on survival, associations of new targeted therapies with radiation are needed. As EGFR and VEGFR expressions were shown to be important for NSCLC cancer, there is significant rationale behind the treatment of these tumours with BMS-690514. In this study, we showed that the initial inhibition of EGFR and VEGFR by a small inhibitor of tyrosine kinase used as a stand-alone treatment could induce an anti-tumoural effect on several NSCLC xenografts. Chronic administration of BMS-690514 (30mgkg ?1day ?1) is well tolerated in athymic mice (Figure 4C) and produces significant inhibition of tumour growth (Figure 3). These results are consistent with previous in vitro data that reported a cytotoxic effect on NSCLC cell lines (De la Motte Rouge et al, 2007). Interestingly, these effects were observed even on T790M-harbouring tumours that confer resistance to an EGFR inhibitor such as Erlotinib (Figure 3). We then showed that this double tyrosine kinase blockade could enhance the anti-tumoural effect of radiotherapy in a sequential manner (Figure 4). We observed that BMS-690514 had no effect on radiation response in in vitro assays but led to a marked tumour growth delay when used sequentially with IR in vivo. Although no radiosensitisation effect was observed in the concomitant schedule, a strong synergistic activity was shown in adjuvant sequence (Figure 4). The positive interaction observed when BMS-690514 is used as an adjuvant to radiotherapy supports an important role for VEGF-mediated pathway in the tumour response to radiotherapy in vivo. The anti-tumour activity of radiation could be influenced by many factors, such as intrinsic tumour radiosensitivity, altered capacity for DNA repair, and the VEGF pathway. Some findings have shown that the induction of VEGF by irradiation contributes to the protection of tumour blood vessels from radiation-mediated cytotoxicity, and thereby to tumour radioresistance (Gorski et al, 1999). Furthermore, radiation therapy resulted in an increased expression of both VEGFR-2 and EGFR in lung tumours, leading to tumour proliferation and survival (Shibuya et al, 2007). Adjuvant inhibition of angiogenesis, that is, application of anti-angiogenic compounds after radiotherapy has been completed, is suggested to prolong the dormancy of residual tumour cells by inhibiting the formation of the new blood vessels that are required for regrowth of tumour cells that survived irradiation (Kerbel, 2008). Vascular endothelial growth factor seems to be expressed as the principal pro-angiogenic factor for early-stage cancers (Ferrara, 2004), and tumour progression, including progression after curative treatment, is often associated with an altered expression of other pro-angiogenic factors. This concept is supported by some studies that show that tumour blood flow increases after irradiation, probably contributing to the regrowth of cancer because certain cells survived irradiation (Hori et al, 2008). The questions of optimal scheduling have been addressed in limited studies combining radiotherapy with a number of anti-angiogenic agents (Williams et al, 2004; Dings et al, 2007; Shibuya et al, 2007) A study using concomitant PTK787/ZK222584 failed to show enhancement over radiotherapy alone, and study results showed that drug therapy after irradiation was optimal (Zips et al, 2005). A study with Vandetanib reported that when radiation therapy is combined concomitantly with VEGFR2 and EGFR blockade, a significant enhancement of anti-angiogenic, anti-vascular, and anti-tumour effects is seen in an orthotopic model of lung cancer (Kerbel, 2008). Another previous study with Vandetanib in a Calu-6 tumour model showed that sequential administration with Vandetanib after radiotherapy was optimal, although concurrent treatment with Vandetanib and radiotherapy was better than treatment with either alone (Williams et al, 2004). Other tyrosine kinase inhibitors with anti-angiogenic effects, such as SU5416 (a VEGFR inhibitor) and SU6668 (an inhibitor of VEGF, fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors), also enhance the anti-tumour effects of fractionated irradiation independent of drug sequencing (Ning et al, 2002). The radiopotentiating effect of BMS-690514 was reduced when BMS-690514 was administered concomitantly with radiation as compared with a sequential schedule. After 3 days of BMS-690514 administration (30mgkg ?1day ?1), the proportion of abnormal tumour vessels seemed to be lesser than that in vehicle-treated controls and a qualitative reduction in CD34-positive vessel area was observed (Figure 5). Hence, this reduced perfusion could induce an increase in hypoxic fraction within treated tumours that could potentially affect the tumour response to radiotherapy when an anti-angiogenic compound is administered before or during radiotherapy. The reduced perfusion observed as a consequence of BMS-690514 administration may inhibit this effect, thereby limiting the potential for reoxygenation and the efficacy of the fractionated radiotherapy used. These observations are consistent with previous reports of reduced tumour vascular permeability/perfusion after Vandetanib treatment, a VEGFR and EGFR inhibitor (Checkley et al, 2003).The results from the study with Vandetanib showing that the schedule of concomitant association of Vandetanib results in poor enhancement of radiation were attributed to decreased perfusion in the concurrent schedule such that radiotherapy was impaired (Williams et al, 2004). However, the effect of the sequence could be related to EGFR blockade, as these results were not observed with SU5416 (a VEGFR inhibitor) and SU6668 (an inhibitor of VEGF, fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors). The type of cell lines tested may also influence the sequence dependency of the findings with concurrent irradiation, as comparisons between models strongly and weakly expressing EGFR show that EGFR \u00a1\u00aestrong' cell lines exhibit both increased tumour growth delay after exposure to IR and a dual EGFR?VEGFR2 inhibition with paradoxical superiority of concomitant versus adjuvant sequencing in EGFR \u00a1\u00aeweak' cell lines (Gustafson et al, 2008). A preclinical evaluation of the combination of ionising radiation and 4h after the last radiation dose showed that a vascular disrupting agent, ZD6126, combined with the anti-EGFR Gefitinib did enhance in vivo tumour growth delay in NSCLC models (Raben et al, 2004). Altogether, the sequence dependency effects of the combination of anti-vascular agents and anti-EGFR inhibitors on ionising radiation may differ depending on models and drugs. However, there is consistency regarding the beneficial effect of adjuvant treatment. Our data are in line with these findings. Given the fact that this type of scheduling offers minimal toxicity hazard compared with concurrent treatment, adjuvant treatment should be the optimal treatment in a clinical setting. In conclusion, these data show that inhibition of both the VEGF and EGFR pathways demonstrates efficacy in NSCLC xenografts and that combining such agents with radiation could improve the anti-tumour activity of radiation alone. However, scheduling seems to be an important factor to be taken into account to establish optimal effect. This study supports the development of BMS-690514 in NSCLC as an adjuvant to radiotherapy in a clinical. Notes. The authors declare no conflict of interest. References.",

Despite its clinical significance, the mechanism of progression into LBC is unknown. Here we show that LBC but not CML cells express the B cell-specific mutator enzyme AID. We demonstrate that AID expression in CML cells promotes overall genetic instability by hypermutation of tumor suppressor and DNA repair genes. Importantly, our data uncover a causative role of AID activity in the acquisition of BCR-ABL1 mutations leading to Imatinib-resistance, thus providing a rationale for the rapid development of drug resistance and blast crisis progression. Introduction. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) promotes somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes in germinal center (GC) B cells (Muramatsu et al., 2000; Revy et al., 2000). AID initiates both processes by deaminating Ig gene cytidines into uracils, thereby creating DNA mismatches that are ultimately processed into mutations or DNA breaks (Chaudhuri et al., 2003; Dickerson et al., 2003; Petersen-Mahrt et al., 2002). While AID primarily acts on Ig variable and switch regions, non-Ig genes including BCL6, CD79A, CD79B, CD83, and PAX5 are occasionally targeted by hypermutation in GC B cells (Shen et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2008). AID off-target activity has been implicated in malignant transformation of GC-derived B cell lymphomas and plasmacytomas (Ramiro et al., 2006; Pasqualucci et al., 2008; Takizawa et al., 2008; Chesi et al., 2008; Robbiani et al., 2008). Additional studies suggest that AID together with RAG1/RAG2 enzymes may also contribute to chromosomal translocations at early stages of B cell development (Tsai et al., 2008). Under physiological circumstances, AID gene expression is induced in mature germinal center or activated B cells by crosslinking of the B cell receptor, CD40, IL4R, and Toll-like receptors (Crouch et al., 2007; Muramatsu et al., 1999). Downstream activation of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB, along with B cell-specific transcription factors PAX5 and E2A are required for transcriptional activation of AID (Gonda et al., 2003; Sayegh et al., 2003; Dedeoglu et al., 2004; Gourzi et al., 2007; Table S1). We have recently demonstrated that oncogenic BCR-ABL1 kinase activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia with Philaldelphia chromosome (Ph + ALL) induces aberrant AID expression (Feldhahn et al., 2007). As in germinal centers, AID in Ph + ALL cells is enzymatically active and can hypermutate BCL6 and Ig genes (Feldhahn et al., 2007). However, whether AID plays a role in malignant progression of Ph + ALL or other BCR-ABL1 leukemias remains unclear. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), first identified in 1845 (Virchow, 1845), is -like Ph + ALL-characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome encoding BCR-ABL1 (Rowley, 1973). CML develops from a hematopoietic stem cell and consequently displays multilineage differentiation potential (Calabretta and Perrotti, 2004). If not efficiently treated, CML follows a triphasic clinical course with an initial indolent chronic phase (CML-CP; 5?15 years) followed by an intermediate accelerated phase and eventually a blast crisis of myeloid (CML-MBC; ~60% incidence), B lymphoid (CML-LBC; 30% incidence) or biphenotypic myeloid/lymphoid (~10% incidence) lineage (Calabretta and Perrotti, 2004). Whereas CML-CP can be effectively treated with Imatinib for many years (Druker et al., 2006), CML-LBC is invariably multidrug-resistant and fatal within weeks or months (Druker et al., 2001). The molecular basis of chronic phase to blast crisis transformation is still largely unknown. However, the majority of patients in blast crisis acquire secondary mutations or deletions at ARF, MYC, RB1, AML1, TP53, and RAS genes (Melo and Barnes, 2007), which are believed to accelerate disease progression. In addition, blast crisis progression correlates with acquisition mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase, which confer resistance to Imatinib: The frequency of such mutations is at least six times higher in blast crisis CML than in chronic phase CML (Soverini et al., 2006; Table S1). In a number of patients, BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations can be found even prior to treatment with Imatinib (Pfeifer et al., 2007). Despite their clinical significance, the mechanisms responsible for Imatinib resistance and genetic instability in CML remain unresolved. We here investigate the hypothesis that aberrant AID expression contributes to widespread genomic instability, Imatinib resistance, and B lymphoid blast crisis progression of CML. Results. To determine whether AID is implicated in CML progression into fatal blast crisis, we examined AID expression in patients with co-existing chronic phase CML (CML-CP) and B lymphoid blast crisis CML (CML-LBC). Leukemia cells of either phenotype were clearly distinguished in bone marrow samples from these patients based on myeloid (CP; CD13 +CD19-CD34 +) and B lymphoid (LBC; CD13-CD19 +CD34 +) markers. Real-time RT-PCR showed significant expression of AID mRNA in CML-LBC blasts, but little or no expression in CML-CP cells (6?10 fold difference, P = 0.013, Figure 1A). By comparison, AID expression in primary LBC blasts was 5?10 fold lower relative to germinal center (GC) B cells isolated from human tonsils (Figure 1A). Western blot analysis also showed AID protein present in LBC but absent in CML-CP cells (Figure 1B). Significantly, AID was in all cases coexpressed with the B cell lineage-inducer PAX5 (Nutt et al., 1999), which has been shown to promote AID gene transcription (Gonda et al., 2003; Sayegh et al., 2003; Figure 1C). To measure AID protein expression on a per cell basis, we performed intracellular staining with an AID-specific antibody. Compared to GC-derived diffuse-large B cell lymphoma cells (DLBCL) that express high levels of AID (Lenz et al., 2007), AID protein was undetectable in bone marrow samples from patients with myeloid CML-CP (Figure 1D). In contrast, patients with early CML-LBC harbored cells expressing AID at varying levels (3?18%) along with the B cell antigen CD19 (Figure 1D). Surface expression of the hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen CD34 on these cells excluded the possibility of sample contamination with mature, AID + activated B cells. We conclude that progression of CML-CP into CML-LBC is characterized by aberrant expression of PAX5 and its transcriptional target AID. We next examined BCR-ABL1-mediated transformation of bone marrow cells from mice carrying an AID-GFP reporter transgene (Crouch et al., 2007). Isolated bone marrow cells from AID-GFP animals were transduced with a retrovirus expressing human BCR-ABL1 (Pear et al., 1998), or a retroviral empty vector control (MSCV). Following transduction, cells were cultured on bone marrow stroma in the presence of either myeloid (IL3, IL6 and SCF) or B lymphoid (IL7) growth factors following classical models of myeloid CML and B lymphoid LBC/Ph + ALL respectively (Li et al., 1999). Under myeloid culture conditions, neither normal nor BCR-ABL1-transformed myeloid progenitor cells displayed AID-GFP reporter expression (Figure 1E). In contrast, ~5% of the BCR-ABL1-transformed B lymphoid progenitors exhibited strong AID-GFP (Figure 1E). In agreement with previous findings (Gourzi et al., 2006), retroviral infection with empty vector control also induced AID-GFP fluorescence in a small number of B lymphoid progenitor cells (0.7%, Figure 1E). Of note, AID expression in BCR-ABL1 AID-GFP + leukemia cells was commensurate to splenic B cells activated with LPS and IL4, and about 240-fold higher than in AID-GFP-counterparts (Figure 1F). To further characterize AID + B lymphoid leukemias, we analyzed AID-GFP + and AID-GFP-cells among BCR-ABL1-transformed B lymphoid leukemia and LPS/IL4-activated splenic B cells with Affymetrix 430 GeneChips (Figure 2). A number of genes typically coexpressed with AID in activated B cells were also upregulated in BCR-ABL1 leukemias (Mfap5, Iigp1, Rcan2, Ccl25, Pim2, Tlr7, Ilr2a, Figure 2A). Conversely, a subset of DNA repair genes were strongly upregulated with AID in activated splenic B cells but absent in BCR-ABL1 leukemia cells (Figure 2B). Among these, Brca1, FancD2 and Rad51 (Longerich et al., 2008), Atm and Cdkn2a (Ramiro et al., 2006), and Chek1 (Gourzi et al., 2006) have been previously implicated either in the repair of AID-induced DNA lesions or negative regulation of AID-induced chromosomal translocation events. Thus, BCR-ABL1-transformed B lymphoid leukemia cells express AID in the absence of the DNA repair mechanisms that typically safeguard genome integrity during normal B cell activation in GCs. In addition to DNA repair molecules, the micro RNA miR-155 acts as a tumor suppressor by protecting B cells from AID-induced chromosomal translocations (Dorsett et al., 2008). This mechanism relies on the ability of mir-155 to negatively regulate AID protein levels and to curb excessive AID activity during B cell activation in GCs (Teng et al., 2008). Deep sequencing analysis of human GC B cells and mouse activated B cells confirmed that expression of AID in these cells is matched by high levels of miR-155 expression (Figure 2C, D). In contrast, human B lymphoid CML-LBC and mouse B lymphoid BCR-ABL1 leukemia cells expressed high levels of AID in the absence of miR-155 (Figure 2C, D). Hence, while AID is readily expressed in B lymphoid CML-LBC, some of the mechanisms that normally constrain AID-mediated genetic instability are not concurrently induced. To determine whether AID is functional in human CML-LBC, we next assessed somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHM), BCL6, and MYC genes, which are targeted by AID in germinal center B cells(Shen et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2008; for a schematic of regions selected for sequence analysis, see Figure S1A?C). In contrast to AID-negative CML-CP cells, AID + CML-LBC cells carried mutations in IGHM, BCL6, and MYC at frequencies comparable to those previously reported for GC B cell-derived lymphoma (Pasqualucci et al., 2001; Figure 3A). To determine whether AID promotes overall genetic instability in BCR-ABL1 tumors, we measured gene copy number alterations (i.e. deletions or amplifications) in 23 primary cases of Ph + ALL using a 250K NspI SNP array (Figure 3B). Based on AID mRNA levels, Ph + ALL samples were classified as either AID high (16 cases) or AID low (7 cases). SNP analysis revealed a higher frequency of gene copy number alterations in the AID high as compared to the AID low group (median 14 [range 6-50] vs. median 5 [range 2?8]; P = 0.02; Figure 3B). Notably, deletion frequencies at the tumor suppressor genes ARF (CDKN2A) and INK4B (CDKN2B) at 9p21 were considerably higher in the presence of AID (P = 0.04; Figure 3B). Deletion of ARF has previously been implicated in the progression of myeloid CML-CP into B lymphoid CML-LBC (Calabretta and Perrotti; 2004). To determine whether AID directly targets ARF in LBC cells, we assayed this locus by ligation-mediated PCR for the presence of ssDNA breaks, which are intermediates of AID-mediated hypermutation(Unniraman and Schatz, 2007). We found evidence of ssDNA breaks at the ARF locus of sorted AID + LBC cells, whereas these lesions were absent in AID-CML-CP cells isolated from the same patients (Figure 3C), indicating ARF is a potential AID target in LBC cells. In support of this view, the CDKN2A (ARF) gene promoter carries five E box motifs (caggtg). E box motifs are tightly associated with AID hypermutation activity at Ig and non-Ig genes alike (Michael et al., 2003). In addition, analysis of a database of published ARF mutations in B lymphoid Ph + ALL and CML-LBC revealed a significant preference for mutations at RGYW or WRCY DNA motifs (13 of 60 mutations (21.7%), P<0.05), which are hotspots for AID-induced hypermutation (Dorner et al., 1997). No such preference was observed in non-lymphoid tumors (24 of 461 mutations (5.2%), P>0.22; Figure S2). These observations suggest that AID promotes genetic instability in CML-LBC via widespread somatic hypermutation. To further explore this idea, we transformed bone marrow B cell precursors from AID ?/? and AID +/+ mice with BCR-ABL1-expressing retroviruses. After 9 weeks in cell culture, we assessed genomic deletions and amplifications by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The frequency of copy number alterations was significantly higher in AID +/+ B lymphoid leukemia cells (52 \u00a1\u00be 12) as compared to their AID ?/? counterparts (20.6 \u00a1\u00be 2.1; P=0.02; Figure 3D). Of note, 22 genes were consistently deleted in the presence but not in the absence of AID (Figure 3E). Among these, we found examples of genes implicated in the DNA repair and/or DNA damage response: Deletions of the Msh3, Ddi2 and Ctnnd2 genes were recurrently found in AID +/+ but not AID ?/? B lymphoid BCR-ABL1 leukemias (Figure 3E), suggesting that AID promotes genetic instability in BCR-ABL1 lymphoid leukemias in part via hypermutation of DNA repair and DNA damage response genes. Acquisition of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations represents a critical event in the progression of CML-CP into fatal CML-LBC, as they often confer resistance to Imatinib treatment(Shah et al., 2002). To investigate a potential role of AID in this process, we amplified and sequenced the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain from single AID-negative myeloid and AID + B lymphoid CML cells isolated from four patients with early CML-LBC under Imatinib-treatment. Single-cell PCR analysis and direct sequencing revealed the presence of L248V and T315I mutations in a significant fraction of B lymphoid but not myeloid CML cells in three of the patients (Figure 4A). The fourth patient showed positive PCR products in only a few sorted B lymphoid CML cells. However, the E255K mutation was repeatedly amplified from bulk CML-LBC cells whereas myeloid cells from the same patient were unmutated (not shown). Since these findings show a straight correlation between AID expression and the acquisition of clinically relevant BCR-ABL1 mutations in CML-LBC, we investigated whether enforced AID expression can induce BCR-ABL1 mutations in CML. To this end, we transduced eight AID-negative myeloid CML cell lines with a retroviral vector encoding AID/GFP or GFP alone (Figure S3). Transduced cells were cultured in the presence or absence of Imatinib for three weeks and the relative enrichment or depletion of GFP + cells was monitored by flow cytometry. While GFP +/GFP-ratios were unchanged in untreated cultures, we observed a preferential expansion of AID-GFP transduced CML cells in the presence of Imatinib (Figure 4B). Importantly, single-cell PCR analysis consistently showed the presence of clinically relevant BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations in Imatinib-treated AID/GFP + but not GFP + CML cells (Table 1). These results were confirmed in a complementary assay based on enzymatic digestion of BCR-ABL1 kinase amplification products (Figure S4). We conclude that enforced AID expression can promote mutagenesis of the BCR-ABL1 oncogene in CML cells. To examine whether this activity leads to Imatinib-resistance in vivo, we then labeled GFP + and AID/GFP + transduced CML cells with lentiviral firefly luciferase and injected them intrafemorally into sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice. Leukemia engraftment was first observed 12 days post-injection (Figure 4C), as determined by bioluminescence imaging. When focal expansion of leukemic growth became evident (day 20), treatment with Imatinib (100 mg/kg twice daily) was started. By day 35, all 14 mice injected with AID/GFP-transduced CML cells had developed progressive disease as opposed to 5 of 12 GFP control mice (P <0.02, Figure 4C). Correspondingly, all mice injected with AID/GFP + CML cells were dead at day 54, whereas about half of the mice injected with GFP + CML cells were still alive 162 days post-injection (Figure 4D). Our transduction studies clearly show that while not absolutely required, AID can accelerate the acquisition of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations in human CML. To test AID-dependence of these mutations in a genetic experiment, we transduced bone marrow B cell precursors from AID +/+ and AID-mice with BCR-ABL1 to generate AID +/+ and AID-B lymphoid BCR-ABL1 leukemias. AID +/+ and AID-B cell precursors transformed by BCR-ABL1 at a similar efficiency, showed similar leukemic growth kinetics, viability, and colony formation potential in a methyl-cellulose semi-solid culture system (Figure S5). Six weeks following transformation, AID +/+ and AID-leukemia cells were treated with increasing concentrations of Imatinib (from 0.1 up to 1.75 \u00a5\u00ecmol/l) over a period of two weeks. Under these conditions, we observed a reproducible survival advantage of AID +/+ relative to AID-leukemia cells (not shown). Importantly, sequence analysis of the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain revealed multiple AID +/+ clones carrying BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations commonly observed in Imatinib-resistant LBC (Shah et al., 2002; Table S2; Figure 4E). Conversely, the BCR-ABL1 mutation frequency in AID ?/? leukemias was within the range of Pfu DNA polymerase error rate (P = 0.09; Figure 4E). A significant number of mutations in AID +/+ cells were C\u00a1\u00e6T (e.g. T315I) or G\u00a1\u00e6A (e.g. E255K) transitions, suggesting that AID could directly target the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. The transcription factor PAX5 regulates both AID-gene expression (Gonda et al., 2003; Sayegh et al., 2003; Table S1) and B cell lineage commitment of hematopoietic progenitor cells (Nutt et al., 1999). To investigate whether ectopic expression of PAX5 in myeloid CML cells was sufficient to induce AID transcription and B cell lineage conversion, we transduced PAX5-negative CML cells with a retroviral vector expressing PAX5/GFP or GFP alone. Enforced expression of PAX5 resulted in significant upregulation of known B cell-specific PAX5-target genes including AID, SLP65 (BLNK), and CD79A (Ig\u00a5\u00e1; Figure 5A). This was accompanied by surface expression of CD19 in a small subset of PAX5/GFP + but not in GFP + CML cells (Figure 5B). Upon prolonged treatment with Imatinib, CD19 + CML subclones were positively selected to more than 16% after 6 weeks (Figure 5B). Furthermore, immunoglobulin spectratyping analysis of PAX5/GFP-transduced CML cells showed evidence of PAX5-induced de novo immunoglobulin V H-DJ H rearrangement (Figure 5C), which is consistent with the role of PAX5 at promoting V H-DJ H recombination (Zhang et al., 2006). Sequence analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in PAX5/GFP-transduced CML cells revealed a striking preference for the most proximal located V H gene segments: among 37 informative clones, only V H6-1 and V H1-2 gene segments (#1 and #2 most proximal located among 123 V H segments) were found rearranged. PAX5-induced V(D)J recombination was also aberrant: instead of an initial D H-J H joint rearranging to different V H-segments, a pre-existing V H-D H joint (V H6-1-D H5-5) was rearranged to various J H segments (J H4 and J H6; Figure 5C). We conclude that ectopic expression of PAX5 in myeloid CML cells induces partial B cell lineage conversion and AID expression. To determine whether PAX5 can promote Imatinib-resistance in CML, PAX5/GFP + and GFP + human leukemia cells were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of Imatinib (0.1 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L to 1.75 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L). In analogy to results obtained with AID/GFP(Figure 4B), we observed a time-dependent outgrowth of PAX5/GFP + CML cells in the presence of Imatinib (Figure 5D). Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of mutations within the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain of PAX5/GFP but not in GFP-transduced CML cells (Table 2). We conclude that enforced PAX5 expression in myeloid CML cells can lead to partial B cell lineage conversion, AID expression, and Imatinib-resistance via BCR-ABL1 mutation. AID-mediated hypermutation preferentially targets RGYW and WRCY hotspot motifs (Dorner et al., 1997) and displays a biased towards C\u00a1\u00e6T and G\u00a1\u00e6A transitions over transversion mutations (Di Noia and Neuberger, 2002; Faili et al., 2002). To explore whether BCR-ABL1 is a direct target of AID, we assembled and analyzed a database of 700 published BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations (572 from CML-CP and 128 from CML-LBC/Ph + ALL; Figure S6; Table S2). In support of direct AID-mediated hypermutation of BCR-ABL1, we found the frequency of C\u00a1\u00e6T and G\u00a1\u00e6A transitions to be notably higher in B lymphoid CML-LBC/Ph + ALL (66.4%) relative to CML-CP (19.9%; P<0.01; Figure 6B; Table S2). This difference was exemplified by the 763G\u00a1\u00e6A transition leading to E255K, and the 764A\u00a1\u00e6T transversion leading to E255V. Both mutations target the same codon and are associated with a similar degree of Imatinib-resistance (IC50 [Imatinib] at 12.1 \u00a5\u00ecmol/l and 17 \u00a5\u00ecmol/l, respectively). In contrast to E255V, the E255K G\u00a1\u00e6A transition occurs 5 times more frequently in CML-LBC/Ph + ALL than in CML-CP. The E255V A\u00a1\u00e6T transversion however, was found in 22 cases of CML-CP (3.8%), but not in a single case of CML-LBC/Ph + ALL (Table S2). We next investigated whether BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations occurred preferentially at RGYW/WRCY motifs based on a previous cytosine deamination quantitative assay, which determined the ability of 68 cytosine-based DNA motifs to serve as a substrate for AID (Yu et al., 2004). We found a significant correlation between potential AID activity (percentage in vitro deamination) and BCR-ABL1 mutation frequency in CML-LBC/Ph + ALL (r=0.36; p=0.01; Figure 6C, D; Figure S6). In contrast, no such correlation was observed for CML-CP (r=?0.14; p=0.36; Figure 6E). Importantly, statistical analyses showed no significant correlation between IC50 values and AID targeting (r=0.04; p=0.84), a feature that argues against the possibility that our results are biased by selective advantage of individual mutations (see Figure 6F and S6 for detailed explanation). Discussion. We have shown here that the transition from chronic phase CML into B lymphoid blast crisis is accompanied by expression of PAX5 and its transcriptional target, the B cell-specific mutator AID. The presence of hypermutation at MYC, ARF, BCL6, and the IGHM loci clearly demonstrates the enzymatic activity of AID in CML-LBC. In like manner, a subset of BCR-ABL1-induced mouse leukemia cells express very high levels of AID and carry deletions and amplifications at an increased frequency relative to BCR-ABL1-induced leukemia cells from AID ?/? mice. The first hint to AID tumorigenic activity was given by studies of transgenic mice expressing AID constitutively and ubiquitously under the chicken \u00a5\u00e2-actin promoter (Okazaki et al., 2003). These animals rapidly succumbed to T cell lymphomas, lung microadenomas, and to a lesser extent sarcomas, hepatocellular carcinomas and melanomas. Surprisingly, B cell ontogeny was not directly affected by AID overexpression. Most importantly, B cell malignancies were not detected in these mice, suggesting that B lymphocytes might have evolved B cell-specific mechanisms to suppress AID tumorigenic activity (Casellas et al., 2009). Error-free base excision and mismatch repair pathways for instance, correct the vast majority of AID-mediated mutations outside the immunoglobulin loci in germinal center B cells (Liu et al., 2008). Likewise, DNA repair proteins, cell cycle regulators, and microRNA mir155 prevent AID-induced DNA double-strand breaks from developing into chromosomal translocations (Dorsett et al., 2008). In stark contrast to activated or GC B cells, B lymphoid AID + CML-LBC cells fail to upregulate the full repertoire of protective mechanisms that normally accompany AID activity. This feature, which is likely to be a recurrent theme in AID + malignancies, would exacerbate AID-mediated hypermutation and/or deletion of tumor suppressor genes. Based on these observations, we propose that aberrant activity of AID and the lack of mechanisms restricting its ability to introduce deletions and chromosomal translocations combine to accelerate the progression from chronic phase into fatal B lymphoid blast crisis in CML patients. In addition to genomic instability, our data uncovered a correlation between AID expression, the acquisition of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations and Imatinib resistance in CML-LBC. This correlation is underscored by the observation that BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations are at least six times more frequent in B lymphoid CML-LBC than in myeloid CML-CP (Soverini et al., 2006; Table S1). Three sets of experiments argue for a causative role of AID in the acquisition of BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations: i) forced expression of AID induces BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations and Imatinib-resistance in human CML cells; ii) forced expression of PAX5 in CML cells leads to AID gene transcription and the acquisition of BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations and iii) AID +/+ but not AID ?/? mouse BCR-ABL1 leukemias acquire BCR-ABL1 mutations and Imatinib-resistance within a short period of time. While BCR-ABL1 mutations do obviously occur in the absence of AID (e.g. as in some cases of CML-CP), our findings demonstrate that AID dramatically accelerates the acquisition of such mutations and, hence, increases their overall frequency (e.g. as in CML-LBC; Table S1). In this context, BCR-ABL1 mutations could arise either directly by way of direct AID-targeted hypermutation, or indirectly as a result of AID-mediated genetic instability (e.g. by targeting of genes that are involved in DNA repair). Below we explore these arguments in detail. In germinal center B cells, somatic hypermutation occurs mostly within a 2 kb window downstream of a gene\u00a1\u00afs transcription start site (TSS), and loses its activity exponentially with increasing distance from this window (Rada and Milstein, 2001). Depending on the precise location of the breakpoints within the BCR and ABL1 genes, the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain is situated approximately 60 to 75 kb downstream of the BCR TSS (Figure S1E), a feature that argues against the direct targeting hypothesis. On the other hand, hypermutation of immunoglobulin switch domains is known to occur up to 10 kb downstream of sterile promoters during isotype switching. Hence, if recruited to an unknown transcription start site downstream of the BCR promoter, AID could in principle exhibit enough residual activity to target the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain. Since many BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations confer drug-resistance, such lesions will be eventually selected from a heterogeneous leukemia cell population even if introduced at extremely low frequencies. Attempts to uncover hypermutation near the BCR promoter in CML-LBC cells have been inconclusive so far (our unpublished observations). A negative result, however, does not necessarily rule out direct targeting of BCL-ABL1 by AID, as hypermutation of a large number of genes in germinal center B cells is only evident in the absence of error-free repair proteins Msh2 and UNG1 (Liu and Schatz, 2008). Alternatively, AID hypermutation could be recruited by the QRFP, LOC100131443 or FIBCD1 genes, which are actively transcribed at 5.4 kb, 10.4 kb and 51.1 kb downstream of and in opposite orientation vis-a-vis BCR-ABL1 (Figure S1E). Of note, the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is located at chromosome 22q11 in close proximity to the human immunoglobulin \u00a5\u00eb locus (Figure S1E), which strongly recruits AID. The ability of the immunoglobulin \u00a5\u00eb locus to recruit AID was further underscored by the recent identification of a cis-acting Diversification Activator (DIVAC) element, which induces AID-dependent hypermutation of both immunoglobulin and non-immunoglobulin genes in DT40 chicken B cells (Kothapalli et al., 2008; Blagodatski et al., 2009; Figure S1E). DIVAC encompasses the immunoglobulin light chain (IgL) enhancer in chicken, a region that is highly homologous to the human immunoglobulin \u00a5\u00eb locus (IGLV), which is located in close proximity to the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (Figure S1E). It is conceivable that enhanced transcriptional activity following the chromosomal break event at 22q11 in the regional context of both the immunoglobulin \u00a5\u00eb locus and DIVAC-like elements may lead to recruitment of AID and aberrant hypermutation of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. Although based on correlative observations, the pattern of BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations in CML-LBC/Ph + ALL indeed suggests direct targeting by AID at a low frequency (Figure 6). Our data however do not rule out that mechanisms downstream of or independent from AID are also at play. Genomic instability resulting from AID-mediated deletion of DNA repair genes would be an example of the former, the acquisition of random mutations as byproducts of cellular oxidative stress or DNA replication errors would exemplify the latter. For instance, a recent mathematical model for drug-resistance in CML proposes that DNA replication errors lead to the acquisition of BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations at a rate of 4 \u00a1\u00bf 10 ?7 per cell division (Michor et al., 2005). This model explains the high frequency of BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations in CML blast crisis on the basis of the particularly high proliferation rate of these cells. CML develops from a hematopoietic stem cell and consequently displays multilineage differentiation potential. During the chronic phase of the disease, the vast majority (>95%) of tumor cells differentiate into committed myeloid progenitors, while a small fraction (<5%) develops into the B lymphoid lineage likely as a result of PAX5 upregulation (Takahashi et al., 1998; Verstegen et al., 1999). In this context, we have shown that enforced expression of PAX5 promotes B cell lineage conversion in CML cells and induces aberrant expression of AID. We propose that this is a key step in the progression from CML-CP to fatal CML-LBC. The development of Imatinib resistance in CML-MBC, which are PAX5-AID-(our unpublished observations), argues against a role of AID in the acquisition of BCR-ABL1 mutations in myeloid blast crisis. However, CML typically exhibits lineage infidelity and in ~10% of cases, B/myeloid biphenotypic leukemia cells give rise to CML blast crisis. By oscillating between myeloid and B lymphoid phenotypes (Takahashi et al., 1998; Verstegen et al., 1999), Imatinib-resistant MBC could in principle originate from mutated B lymphoid CML cells that have subsequently lost their B cell identity. There are several precedents supporting this view: MYC-driven hematopoietic progenitor cell leukemias are known to alternate between B lymphoid and myeloid lineages through spontaneous silencing and reactivation of PAX5-dependent B cell lineage-induction (Yu et al., 2003). Furthermore, Hodgkin\u00a1\u00afs disease represents a prominent example of a human B cell-derived malignancy that has lost its B cell identity through aberrant expression of ID2, an inhibitor of PAX5/E2A (Mathas et al., 2006). Interestingly, we have found that in nearly all cases of CML-MBC analyzed, IGHM V H-DJ H and the Ig \u00a5\u00ea deleting element (KDE) are rearranged (Figure S7). Rearrangement of these loci is considered as a permanent imprint of B cell identity that would be retained even after subsequent myeloid lineage conversion. Importantly, V H-DJ H genes in CML-MBC show evidence of somatic hypermutation (Figure S7), whereas the IGHM and KDE loci are unmutated and in germline configuration in CML-CP. These findings support a B lymphoid origin for at least some cases of CML-MBC, and raise the intriguing possibility that AID activity may promote blast crisis transformation also in the case of CML-MBC. Experimental procedures. Patient samples and cell lines. Normal naive B cells (CD19 + CD27-IgD +) were sorted from peripheral blood of 12 healthy donors by flow cytometry using a FACSVantage SE cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Human germinal center B cells (CD77 highCD38 +IgD ?) were isolated from tonsillar resectates (TKH) and sorted by FACS. Bone marrow samples from patients with CML-CP and early B lymphoid blast crisis CML (Table S3) were provided from the Departments of Hematology and Oncology, Charite University Hospital Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany (WKH) and the GIMEMA Study Group/University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy (GM) in compliance with Institutional Review Board regulations (approval from the Ethik-Kommission of the Charite, Campus Benjamin Franklin and the IRB of the University of Southern California Health Sciences Campus and Committee on Clinical Investigations (CCI) of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles). Informed consent was obtained from all human subjects. Human CML cell lines (EM2, JK1, JURL-MK1, K562, KCL22, KYO, LAMA84, MEG1) and B cell lymphoma cell lines (Karpas-422, MN60, DB) were obtained from DMSZ, Braunschweig, Germany. Aid ?/? and Aid-GFP-transgenic mice, CML xenograft model. Aid ?/? Balb/c mice were derived from Aid ?/? mice (Muramatsu et al., 2000) by speed congenic backcrossing and kindly provided by Dr. Michel C. Nussenzweig (New York). Aid-GFP reporter-transgenic mice were described in Crouch et al., 2007. Mice studied in the experiments described here carried two copies of the Aid-GFP reporter transgene. A detailed description of our CML xenograft model is provided in the Supplementary Materials section. All experiments involving mice conform to the relevant regulatory standards and were reviewed and approved by Childrens Hospital Los Angeles Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Quantitative RT-PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR carried out with the SYBRGreenER mix from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) was performed according to standard PCR conditions. During the PCR amplification, the SYBRGreenER dye in the mix binds to accumulating double-stranded DNA and generates a fluorescence signal proportional to the DNA concentration which can be visualized and measured using a ABI7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) real-time PCR system. Primers for quantitative RT-PCR are listed in Table S4. microRNA mir155 expression in mouse and human CML-LBC relative to activated B cells. Mouse CD43 ? naive B cells were activated ex-vivo in the presence of LPS/IL4 for 72 hours. Human germinal center B cells (CD77 highCD38 +IgD ?) were isolated from tonsil samples by cell sorting. Total RNA was isolated from 10 6 cells and microRNA was processed for Illumina\u00a1\u00afs deep sequencing using the manufacturer protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Mature microRNA sequences (tags) were quantified based on 1 million tags aligned to the mouse and human microRNome as defined by mirBase (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/search.shtml). Clonality analysis, immunoglobulin spectratyping, KDE rearrangement and sequence analysis. PAX5/GFP and GFP-transduced CML and primary CML cells were analyzed for presence of IGHM and KDE gene rearrangements (Table 3) and clonality by spectratyping. To this end, RNA was extracted and subjected to cDNA synthesis. From cDNAs, V H-DJ H gene rearrangements were amplified using PCR primers specific for V H gene segments together with a primer specific for the C\u00a5\u00ec constant region (Table S4). Using a FAM-labeled C\u00a5\u00ec constant region gene -specific primer in a run-off reaction, PCR products were labeled and subsequently analyzed on an ABI3730 DNA analyzer by fragment length analysis. A normal polyclonal B cell repertoire exhibits a bell-shaped curve of individual size-peaks according to a Gaussian-type distribution of length diversity within the V HDJ H junction. Mutation analysis and ligation-mediated PCR. For mutation analysis of ARF, BCL6 and MYC genes, genomic fragments were amplified and sequenced using Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). For each PCR product, both DNA strands were sequenced and mutations were only counted if they were found both in the forward and reverse sequence. PCR primers used for amplification of ARF, BCL6 and MYC fragments are listed in Table S4. The ABL1 kinase portion of BCR-ABL1 transcripts was amplified in two rounds of PCR: To prevent co-amplification of normal ABL1 transcripts, the first round of PCR used BCR- (exon 13) and ABL1- (exon 9) specific primers in 10 cycles of amplification. The second round of amplification (35 cycles) focused on the ABL1 kinase domain (exons 4-6). The rate of Pfu DNA polymerase errors was calculated at 4 \u00a1\u00bf 10 ?5/PCR cycle using genomic DNA from MACS-sorted CD3 + human T cells (immunomagnetic beads from Miltenyi Biotech). A detailed description of the analysis of DNA single-strand breaks by ligation-mediated PCR is provided in the Supplementary Materials section. Western blotting and flow cytometry. Antibodies against human CD19, CD13, CD34, CD38, IgD, VpreB, CD79B (Ig\u00a5\u00e2), IL7\u00a5\u00e1 and \u00a5\u00ec-chain as well as antibodies against mouse CD19, B220, IL7r\u00a5\u00e1, Gr1, c -kit, Sca-1, AA4.1 as well as respective isotype controls were purchased from BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany. For analysis of AID expression by flow cytometry, antibodies against AID (rat anti-human AID IgG2b \u00a5\u00ea, clone EK2 5G9, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) were used together with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rat IgG Cy2, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Prior to staining, cells were fixed with 0.4% para-formaldehyde and incubated for 10 minutes in 90% methanol on ice. For the detection of AID by Western blot, an antibody against human AID (L7E7; Cell Signaling Technology), was used together with the WesternBreeze immunodetection system (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Detection of EIF4E was used as a loading control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Single-cell RT-PCR analysis. AID/GFP- or GFP-transduced CML cells were FACS-sorted into 0.5 ml reaction tubes containing 5\u00a5\u00ecl of 2X ribonuclease inhibitor mix (2\u00a5\u00ecl RNasin [40u/\u00a5\u00ecl] + 18\u00a5\u00ecl 0.15 mol/l NaCl/10 mmol/l Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]/5mM DTT). The cells were then quickly frozen on dry ice and stored at ?80\u00a1\u00c6C. After one freezing and thawing step, which leads to cell lysis, the 10 \u00a5\u00ecl cell lysates were added to 50\u00a5\u00ecl RT-PCR using the Access RT-PCR System (Promega, Madison, WI). RT-PCR primers for BCR-ABL1, ABL1 or COX6B (Table S4), were used (50 pmoles each per reaction). To prevent co-amplification of normal ABL1 transcripts, the first round of PCR used BCR (exon 13)- and ABL1 (exon 9)-specific primers for specific amplification of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts. The second round of amplification focused on the [BCR-] ABL1 kinase domain (exons 4?6). The rate of Taq DNA polymerase errors was calculated at 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 ?4/ PCR cycle and PCR products were directly sequenced. Affymetrix GeneChip analysis. Bone marrow progenitor cells from AID-GFP reporter transgenic mice were transformed with a retroviral BCR-ABL1 vector under B lymphoid growth conditions (IL7). As a control, splenocytes were isolated from AID-GFP reporter transgenic mice and incubated in the presence of 25 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml LPS and 10 ng/ml IL4. We sorted AID-GFP + and AID-GFP - cells from BCR-ABL1-transformed leukemia cells and LPS/IL4-stimulated splenocytes and subjected the cells to RNA isolation and microarray analysis using the 430 GeneChip platform (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) mapping assay and Comparative genomic hybridization. Genomic DNA was extracted from AID high and AID low Ph + ALL samples and subjected to 250K NspI SNP array analysis as described in the Supplementary Materials section. For comparative genomic hybridization, bone marrow cells from AID ?/? and AID +/+ mice were transduced with BCR-ABL1. After 9 weeks in cell culture, genomic DNA was isolated and amplifications and deletions were detected using the Mouse Genome CGH Microarray Kit 244A (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara) as described in the Supplemental Materials section. Accession numbers. Microarray gene expression data, SNP Chip data and CGH data are available from GEO. Microarray gene expression data on BCR-ABL1 leukemia cells from Aid-GFP transgenic bone marrow are available under GEO accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE13611\",\"term_id\":\"13611\"}}GSE13611.

Treatment of patients with CML in chronic phase with the BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor Imatinib leads to a five-year overall survival of ~95%. Upon blast crisis progression, however, median overall survival decreases to less than seven months and CML blasts are frequently Imatinib-resistant due to BCR-ABL1 mutations. Here we show that PAX5-mediated B cell lineage conversion of CML cells results in transcription of AID, a B cell-specific enzyme that hypermutates immunoglobulin and other genes in germinal center B cells. In CML cells, AID promotes widespread hypermutation, B lymphoid blast crisis progression, BCR-ABL1 mutation and the acquisition of Imatinib-resistance. Our studies shed light on the origin of CML-LBC and identify AID as a potential pharmacological target to suppress fatal blast crisis transformation. Supplementary Material. 1. 2. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Structure-Function Correlation of G6, a Novel Small Molecule Inhibitor of Jak2\tSomatic mutations in the Jak2 protein, such as V617F, cause aberrant Jak/STAT signaling and can lead to the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms. This discovery has led to the search for small molecule inhibitors that target Jak2. Using structure-based virtual screening, our group recently identified a novel small molecule inhibitor of Jak2 named G6. Here, we identified a structure-function correlation of this compound. Specifically, five derivative compounds of G6 having structural similarity to the original lead compound were obtained and analyzed for their ability to (i) inhibit Jak2-V617F-mediated cell growth, (ii) inhibit the levels of phospho-Jak2, phospho-STAT3, and phospho-STAT5; (iii) induce apoptosis in human erythroleukemia cells; and (iv) suppress pathologic cell growth of Jak2-V617F-expressing human bone marrow cells ex vivo. Additionally, we computationally examined the interactions of these compounds with the ATP-binding pocket of the Jak2 kinase domain. We found that the stilbenoid core-containing derivatives of G6 significantly inhibited Jak2-V617F-mediated cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. They also inhibited phosphorylation of Jak2, STAT3, and STAT5 proteins within cells, resulting in higher levels of apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Finally, the stilbenoid derivatives inhibited the pathologic growth of Jak2-V617F-expressing human bone marrow cells ex vivo. Collectively, our data demonstrate that G6 has a stilbenoid core that is indispensable for maintaining its Jak2 inhibitory potential. Introduction. Jak2 plays a critical role in animal development, because mice that are devoid of a functional Jak2 allele die during embryonic development because of a lack of hematopoiesis (1, 2). Deregulation of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway promotes cell growth and prevents apoptosis in a variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies such as acute lymphoid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia (3,?6). Additionally, a somatic Jak2 mutation (Jak2-V617F) is found in a high number of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) 2 patients including 90% of polycythemia vera patients and \u00a1\u00ad50% of patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis (7,?11). MPNs are a group of heterogeneous diseases arising from a transformed hematopoietic stem cell and characterized by excessive numbers of one or more terminally differentiated blood cells of the myeloid lineage such as erythrocytes, thrombocytes, or white blood cells. A guanine to thymine mutation in hematopoietic stem cells results in a substitution of valine to phenylalanine at codon 617 in exon 14 of the JH2 pseudokinase domain of Jak2. It is believed that this mutation allows the kinase to evade negative feedback inhibition, thereby leading to a constitutively active Jak/STAT signaling pathway characterized by growth factor-independent cell growth (8, 10). Given the critical role that Jak2 plays in the pathophysiology of MPNs, identification of specific Jak2 inhibitors has become an important step toward the development of an effective targeted therapy for these disorders. Using structure-based virtual screening, our group recently identified a novel small molecule inhibitor of Jak2 named G6 (12). We showed that G6 has a specific inhibitory effect on Jak2 kinase activity as measured by in vitro enzyme assays and an immunoassay ELISA (12). Examination of the chemical structure of G6 revealed the presence of a central stilbenoid core. Stilbenoids are a group of naturally occurring compounds having a wide range of biological activities. For example, resveratrol, piceatannol, 3,4,5,4\u00a1\u00c7-tetramethoxystilbene, and 3,5,4\u00a1\u00c7-trimethoxy-trans-stilbene are all stilbenoids and are known to have cytotoxic, anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-angiogenic, or tumor-suppressive effects (13,?17). We hypothesized that the central stilbenoid core in the G6 structure has a critical role to play in mediating its Jak2 inhibitory potential. To test this, five derivative compounds of G6, namely D21, D23, D25, D28, and D30, having structural similarity to the original lead compound, were procured from the NCI, National Institutes of Health. Two of these compounds, D28 and D30, have a stilbenoid core present in their chemical structure similar to G6, whereas the three other compounds, D21, D23, and D25, lack the stilbenoid core. We report here that the core stilbenoid structure present in G6 is essential for maintaining its ability to inhibit Jak2 kinase activity. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.  G6 and its five structurally related derivative compounds (D21, D23, D25, D28, and D30) were obtained from the National Institutes of Health NCI/Developmental Therapeutics Program, which maintains a repository of \u00a1\u00ad140,000 compounds. Each compound was solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 10 mm and stored at ?20\u00a1\u00c6C.  Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Ba/F3-EpoR-Jak2-V617F cells were created as described before (18). Both cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and 5% CO 2.  HEL cells or Ba/F3-EpoR-Jak2-V617F cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with either 0.25% DMSO or varying concentrations of G6 and its derivatives for the indicated periods of time. Cell viability was assessed either by trypan blue exclusion staining or by MTS (Promega) as per the manufacturer's protocol.  HEL cells were treated with either 0.25% DMSO or 25 \u00a5\u00ecm of the inhibitor compounds for 48 h, and the cell lysates were analyzed by ELISA for detection of phospho-Jak2, phospho-STAT3, and phospho-STAT5. Jak2 (Tyr(P) 1007/Tyr(P) 1008), STAT3 (Tyr(P) 705), and STAT5b (Tyr(P) 699) ELISA kits were purchased from Invitrogen and used according to the manufacturer's protocol.  HEL cells were treated with the different drugs for the indicated periods of time. The cells (\u00a1\u00ad 10 7) were then lysed in 0.8 ml of ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The cell lysates (\u00a1\u00ad2500 \u00a5\u00ecg) were then immunoprecipitated by incubation with 2 \u00a5\u00ecg of the appropriate antibody and 20 \u00a5\u00ecl of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C with constant shaking. The protein complexes were washed thrice with immunoprecipitation wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and then resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The anti-STAT3 and anti-STAT5 antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For whole cell protein lysates, \u00a1\u00ad50 \u00a5\u00ecg of soluble protein was separated via SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for analysis by Western blotting.  Nitrocellulose membranes were first blocked with 5% milk/TBST solution and then probed with the different primary antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were then visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Western Lightning Ultra; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following antibodies were used at the indicated dilutions: phospho-STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Cell Signaling, 1:500), STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000), phospho-STAT5 (Cell Signaling, 1:500), STAT5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000), and STAT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000). The following were all obtained from Cell Signaling and used at a 1:500 dilution; poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, Bcl-2, Bax, Bim, and Bid.  Induction of apoptosis in HEL cells was determined with the FITC annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Pharmigen) per the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were incubated with 0.25% DMSO or 25 \u00a5\u00ecm of inhibitors for 48 h and then analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).  The mRNA levels of Bcl-xL and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were measured by quantitative real time PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from HEL cells and treated with 25 \u00a5\u00ecm of the different drugs for 8 and 24 h, using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. 2 \u00a5\u00ecg of each RNA sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA in a final reaction volume of 20 \u00a5\u00ecl using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) Hs02758991_g1 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and Hs00236329_m1 (Bcl-xL) were used to detect the levels of expression of these genes. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene expression was used as an internal loading control. Real time PCR was then performed with TaqMan universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a final reaction volume of 20 \u00a5\u00ecl in a StepOne real time PCR system as per the manufacturer's protocol.  Bone marrow aspirates consisting of mononuclear cells were obtained from a de-identified Jak2-V617F-positive female diagnosed with polycythemia vera (World Health Organization criteria) at the University of Florida & Shands Teaching Hospital as per an institutional review board-approved protocol.  Marrow-derived mononuclear cells were washed in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and cultured in human methylcellulose complete medium without erythropoietin (R & D Systems) at a concentration of \u00a1\u00ad4 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells/ml in the presence or absence of G6 or its structurally related derivatives. 0.9 ml of the cultures was placed in 35-mm Petri dishes and incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and 5% CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere for 14 days, after which the number of erythroid colony-forming units was determined.  The molecular docking program DOCK6 (19, 20) was used to study the interactions of Jak2 with ATP, the ATP analog ACP, G6, and the structurally related derivative compounds. The template used was the crystal structure of Jak2 kinase domain in complex with the Jak2 inhibitor 5B3 (Protein Data Bank code 3E64) (21). The coordinates for ATP, ACP, and each of the small molecules were generated and energy-minimized using PRODRG (22). Subsequently, Chimera (23) was used to add atomic charges to these small molecules. After removing the 5B3 molecule, the coordinates of the Jak2 kinase domain were saved in Protein Data Bank format. To prepare the protein for docking, hydrogen atoms and partial electrostatic charges were first added to the molecule. A molecular surface of the Jak2 kinase domain was then generated using the DMS tool in Chimera. The program SPHGEN was used to generate spheres around the active site for identification of the target pocket on the protein for small molecule docking. The GRID file, necessary for rapid GRID-based energy score evaluation, was then generated around the identified docking site using the GRID module in DOCK6. Each compound was docked in 1000 different orientations using flexible dock, and a net energy GRID score was generated for each, based on the van der Waal's and electrostatic interactions between the compound and the residues in the binding pocket. The favorable binding orientations were selected on the basis of the energy GRID scores generated for each orientation, wherein a favorable binding orientation would have a more negative score. Finally, the docking results were analyzed visually using COOT (24) and Chimera. Surface electrostatic potentials were calculated using APBS (25), and PyMol (26) was used to generate the figures.  For statistical evaluation of time-dependent responses to the different inhibitor compounds, a two-way analysis of variance was used. For analysis of inhibition of phosphorylation, induction of apoptosis, modulation of gene expression, and suppression of pathologic cell growth ex vivo, a Student's t test was employed. The data were assumed to be statistically significant when p < 0.05. RESULTS.  The human erythroleukemia (HEL 92.1.7) cell line is homozygous for the Jak2-V617F mutation, and this gain-of-function mutation is responsible for its transformed phenotype (27, 28). Proliferation of HEL cells is mediated by the constitutively active Jak2-V617F signaling, which promotes a G 1/S phase transition, thereby leading to increased cellular proliferation (29). G6 and its five structurally related derivatives were therefore first analyzed for their ability to inhibit the Jak2-V617F-dependent proliferation of HEL cells. Viable cell numbers were determined by trypan blue exclusion and hemocytometer after 72 h. Each sample was measured in triplicate. Inhibition by G6 was arbitrarily set at 100%, and the percentage of inhibition for all of the other compounds relative to G6 was defined as 1.00 ? (\u00a5\u00c4 drug/\u00a5\u00c4 vehicle control). Supplemental Table S1 summarizes the percentage of growth inhibition for each of the six compounds. We found that the stilbene-containing derivatives (D28 and D30) had high growth inhibition potentials, whereas those compounds lacking the stilbenoid core (D21, D23, and D25) had low growth inhibition potentials. To determine the ability of each of these compounds to inhibit Jak2-V617F-mediated HEL cell proliferation, the cells were treated either for varying periods of time or with increasing concentrations of G6 or its derivatives. Viable cell numbers for each treatment were determined. When compared with vehicle-treated cells, we found that G6 and its stilbenoid derivatives (D28 and D30) significantly reduced viable cell numbers in a time-dependent manner, whereas the non-stilbenoid derivatives (D21, D23, and D25) did not (Fig. 1A). We also found that G6 and the two stilbenoid derivatives (D28 and D30) markedly inhibited the growth of HEL cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), whereas the three non-stilbenoid derivatives (D21, D23, and D25) showed no growth inhibition of HEL cells (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation of Jak2 at tyrosine residues 1007/1008 is concomitant with higher kinase activity and increased cellular proliferation (11). Therefore, we next wanted to determine whether the presence of the stilbenoid core is critical for reduction of phospho-Jak2 levels within treated cells. Phospho-Jak2 levels were measured 48 h after drug exposure rather than the 72 h used in Fig. 1 (A?C), because far fewer viable cells exist at the longer time point. Exposure of HEL cells to stilbenoid core-bearing compounds (G6, D28, and D30) significantly decreased the levels of phospho-Jak2 (Fig. 1D) when compared with those derivatives that lack the stilbenoid core (D21, D23, and D25). We next wanted to determine whether the ability of G6 to inhibit Jak2-V617F-mediated cell proliferation was valid for other cell lines with constitutively active Jak2. For this, we studied the ability of these compounds to inhibit Ba/F3 cells stably expressing Jak2-V617F. The introduction of the Jak2-V617F cDNA into these cells via retroviral transduction confers cytokine-independent growth that is entirely Jak2-V617F-dependent (18). The cells were treated with various doses of the different drugs, and viable cell numbers were assessed after 72 h using an MTS assay. G6 and its stilbenoid derivatives (D28 and D30) showed significant inhibition of cell growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A) when compared with the non-stilbenoid derivatives (D21, D23, and D25) (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the stilbenoid core is essential for maintaining the ability of G6 to inhibit Jak2-V617F-dependent cell growth, and the reduced cell growth correlates with significantly reduced levels of phospho-Jak2.  In the canonical Jak/STAT signaling pathway, an active Jak2 phosphorylates STAT proteins such as STAT3 and STAT5, which ultimately translocate to the nucleus and modulate gene transcription (10). Hence, we wanted to determine whether the stilbenoid core is critical for the inhibition of STAT phosphorylation. HEL cells were treated for 48 h with the different compounds, and phospho-STAT levels were determined. G6 and its stilbenoid derivatives (D28 and D30) significantly decreased phospho-STAT3 levels as measured by ELISA (Fig. 3A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). Similarly, only the stilbenoid-containing compounds (G6, D28 and D30) significantly decreased phospho-STAT5 levels as measured by ELISA (Fig. 3C) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3D). As such, these data confirm the ability of G6 and its stilbenoid derivatives to down-regulate the phosphorylation of key signaling molecules involved in Jak2-dependent pathological cell growth, namely STAT3 and STAT5.  Deregulation of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway is known to promote cell proliferation and prevent apoptosis in several different cancers (30). Given that G6 and its stilbenoid core-containing derivatives inhibited Jak2-V617F-dependent cell proliferation and Jak/STAT activation, we next wanted to determine whether these drugs induce apoptotic death. HEL cells treated with G6 and the stilbenoid derivatives (D28 and D30) exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of cells in early apoptosis when compared with the DMSO or the non-stilbenoid-treated (D21, D23, and D25) cells (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B is a quantitative graph of four independent experiments showing the amount of apoptosis plotted as a function of treatment condition. We observed that the percentage of cells in early apoptosis increased from 7.45% in the DMSO-treated control to 27.8% in G6-treated, 31.3% in D28-treated, and 34.2% in D30-treated HEL cells, whereas it remained almost unchanged for the non-stilbenoid-treated cells (Fig. 4B). Jak2/STAT signaling is known to positively regulate cell growth by directly increasing expression of the anti-apoptotic marker, Bcl-xL, via STAT-binding elements present in its promoter region (31, 32). To determine whether the presence of the stilbenoid core correlates with reduced levels of Bcl-xL, we measured Bcl-xL mRNA levels in cells treated with the different compounds. The stilbenoids (G6, D28, and D30) significantly decreased Bcl-xL expression in HEL cells when compared with DMSO or the non-stilbenoids (D21, D23, and D25) at both 8 h (Fig. 5A) and 24 h (Fig. 5B) of treatment. As such, these data indicate that the presence of the stilbenoid core does in fact correlate with markedly reduced levels of the proliferative marker, Bcl-xL. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family (33). Therefore, we next monitored the expression of Bcl-2 family members in HEL cells treated with 25 \u00a5\u00ecm of the different compounds for 24 h. As expected, the stilbenoid derivates (G6, D28, and D30) induced greater cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a marker of apoptosis, when compared with the non-stilbenoids (D21, D23, and D25) (Fig. 5C). We also observed a stilbenoid-dependent increase in the protein levels of Bim, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family (Fig. 5D). The pro-apoptotic protein, Bid, is present in the cytosol as an inactive precursor. Upon proteolytic cleavage, its active form is generated, which translocates to the mitochondria and induces mitochondrial damage and destabilization (34). We found that the stilbenoid compounds decreased the levels of the inactive precursor form of Bid, a hallmark of Bid cleavage and subsequent apoptosis. We found that the protein levels of Bax and Bcl-2 did not change with any treatment (Fig. 5D). Lastly, the samples were blotted with an anti-STAT1 antibody to demonstrate equal protein loading across all lanes (Fig. 5D). Overall, the data in Figs. 4 and ?and55 indicate that the stilbenoid core of G6 is critical for its ability to induce apoptotic cell death in HEL cells via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bim, and cleavage of Bid.  We next wanted to determine whether the stilbene core is also essential for its ability to inhibit pathologic cell growth of patient-derived bone marrow cells ex vivo. For this, we used a colony formation assay that measures the number of erythroid colony-forming units that are produced when marrow-derived stem cells are cultured ex vivo. Stem cells isolated from a normal individual will be unable to grow in the absence of exogenously added cytokine. However, the Jak2-V617F mutation confers cytokine-independent cell growth. Here, mononuclear cells isolated from the bone marrow of a Jak2-V617F-positive female polycythemia vera patient were cultured in medium lacking erythropoietin. DMSO or 5 \u00a5\u00ecm of inhibitor was added as indicated. Our previous work has shown that 5 \u00a5\u00ecm of G6 inhibits \u00a1\u00ad50% of the cytokine-independent growth of Jak2-V617F-expressing, marrow-derived stem cells (12). The results here show that treatment of the primary cultures with either G6 or the stilbenoids (D28 and D30) significantly blocked cytokine-independent pathologic cell growth when compared with the DMSO and non-stilbenoid-treated (D21, D23, and D25) samples (Fig. 6). As such, the data in Fig. 6 demonstrate that the stilbenoid core of G6 is essential for reducing Jak2-dependent pathologic cell growth of human bone marrow mononuclear cells cultured ex vivo.  Using the known structure of the Jak2 kinase domain (21), ATP, the ATP analog ACP, G6, and each of its five structurally related derivatives were docked into the ATP-binding pocket. The goal was to analyze the potential interactions of these compounds with amino acids in this binding region. The ATP-binding pocket of Jak2 and the important residues clustered in this pocket have been described previously (35, 36). Generation of the electrostatic surface potential for the Jak2 kinase domain showed the predicted presence of acidic and basic patch residues clustered at the ATP-binding pocket (supplemental Fig. S1). We found that both ATP and ACP docked extremely well into this pocket (Fig. 7A) with GRID scores of ?76.81 and ?62.37 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, the docked molecules showed excellent correlation with the known crystal structures of ACP and ATP complexed with the kinase domains of other proteins (37,?40). We found that the stilbenoids had higher binding affinities when compared with the non-stilbenoids as indicated by their more negative energy scores. G6, D28, D30, D21, D23, and D25 had energy scores of ?75.46, ?63.24, ?72.26, ?27.69, ?38.90, and ?48.91 kcal/mol, respectively. The docking orientations of G6, D28, and D30 into the pocket (Fig. 7B) were very similar to that of ATP/ACP (supplemental Fig. S1) and distinctly different from those of the non-stilbenoids (Fig. 7C). The docking conformation of each of the stilbenoid inhibitors into the ATP-binding pocket also correlated well (root mean square deviation of <2 \u00a1\u00ca) with the previously reported structure of another Jak2 inhibitor, 5B3, in complex with the Jak2 kinase domain (Fig. 7D). Examination of the most favorable docking orientations for G6 and each of its derivatives showed the presence of hydrogen bonds (<3.5 \u00a1\u00ca) and van der Waal's interactions between the stilbenoid derivatives and the ATP-binding pocket of Jak2 (Fig. 8). Specifically, the stilbenoid core-containing derivatives exhibited van der Waal's interactions with many of the hydrophobic residues in the binding pocket such as Val 863, Leu 855, Leu 983, Leu 932, Tyr 931, Ala 880, and Val 911. The stilbenoid-containing derivatives also formed hydrogen bond interactions with several important surrounding residues including Asp 994, Arg 980, Glu 930, and Leu 932. The non-stilbenoid derivatives, however, did not show any such hydrogen bond interactions with these critical residues of the Jak2 ATP-binding pocket. Overall, these data demonstrate the importance of the stilbenoid core structure for stronger docking interactions of the drug with the ATP-binding pocket of Jak2. DISCUSSION. Somatic Jak2 mutations, such as the Jak2-V617F, which result in deregulated Jak/STAT signaling, have been identified in numerous patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and are known to play a primary role in the pathogenesis of these diseases (7,?11). Therefore, identification of novel compounds having inhibitory effects against hyperkinetic Jak2 has become an attractive therapeutic strategy in MPN. Using structure-based virtual screening, our group recently identified a novel Jak2 small molecule inhibitor called G6 (12). In this report, we describe a structure-function correlation of this inhibitor compound. We demonstrate that it has a central stilbenoid core in its structure that is indispensable for maintaining its ability to inhibit Jak2 kinase activity. G6 and its stilbenoid core-containing derivatives (D28 and D30) effectively inhibit Jak2-V617F-mediated HEL cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Correspondingly, they are also capable of suppressing the phosphorylation of Jak2, STAT3, and STAT5 proteins. Furthermore, these stilbenoids significantly induce apoptosis in treated cells via the intrinsic pathway and possess the ability to block ex vivo pathologic cell growth of bone marrow cells isolated from a Jak2-V617F-positive MPN patient. Stilbenes are a group of compounds with a wide range of diverse biological activities. Stilbenoids, such as resveratrol, piceatannol, and diethylstilbestrol, are reported to have anti-proliferative, anti-oxidative, anti-neovascularization, and tumor-suppressive effects (13,?15). Resveratrol has beneficial cardiovascular effects (41), whereas diethylstilbestrol is known to have estrogen activity (42). Piceatannol, a naturally occurring phenolic stilbenoid, is the only stilbenoid that is a known protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It inhibits LMP2A, a viral tyrosine kinase implicated in diseases associated with the Epstein-Barr virus as well as the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Syk and Lck (43, 44). Here, we report that G6, which is also a stilbene, has anti-Jak2 tyrosine kinase activity. More importantly, the trans-stilbenoid core identified in all of the active compounds is now being subjected to bioisosteric replacements (45) that would result in new Jak2 chemotypes with improved druglike properties. Computational docking of G6 and its structurally related derivatives into the ATP-binding pocket of Jak2 revealed important interactions between the inhibitors and specific residues within Jak2. For example, Glu 930 and Leu 932 are part of the important hinge region of the Jak2 kinase domain and are known to be involved in adenine binding. We found that these residues were occupied by the stilbenoid-containing compounds but not the non-stilbenoids. Another amino acid that interacted with the docked stilbenoid inhibitors was Asp 994, located in the highly conserved DFG motif. This motif is part of the critical activation loop of the kinase, and our group was the first to identify the importance of this residue as it relates to Jak2 kinase inhibition (12). We show here that the stilbenoid core-bearing inhibitors also had a hydrogen bond interaction with Arg 980, which is a part of the catalytic loop and is known to be one of the residues involved in the coordination of magnesium ions (35, 36). Thus, the ability of the stilbenoid derivatives to simultaneously interact, in silico, with the hinge region, the DFG motif, and the catalytic loop suggests that they may interfere with both ATP-binding function and activation loop phosphorylation, thereby making them potent Jak2 inhibitors. In summary, our data collectively show that the central stilbenoid core structure is indispensable for maintaining anti-Jak2 kinase activity of the small molecule inhibitor G6.

                "text": "Establishment and characterisation of a new breast cancer xenograft obtained from a woman carrying a germline BRCA2 mutation\t Background:. The BRCA2 gene is responsible for a high number of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, and studies of the BRCA2 biological functions are limited by the lack of models that resemble the patient's tumour features. The aim of this study was to establish and characterise a new human breast carcinoma xenograft obtained from a woman carrying a germline BRCA2 mutation.  Methods:. A transplantable xenograft was obtained by grafting a breast cancer sample into nude mice. The biological and genetic profiles of the xenograft were compared with that of the patient's tumour using histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), BRCA2 sequencing, comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH), and qRT?PCR. Tumour response to standard chemotherapies was evaluated.  Results:. Histological profile identified the tumour as a basal-like triple-negative breast cancer. Targeted BRCA2 DNA sequencing of the xenograft showed the presence of the mutation previously identified in the carrier. Comparative genomic hybridisation array profiles of the primary tumour and the xenograft revealed a high number of similar genetic alterations. The therapeutic assessment of the xenograft showed sensitivity to anthracyclin-based chemotherapy and resistance to docetaxel. The xenograft was also highly sensitive to radiotherapy and cisplatin-based treatments.  Conclusions:. This study describes a new human breast cancer xenograft obtained from a BRCA2-mutated patient. This xenograft provides a new model for the pre-clinical drug development and for the exploration of the drug response biological basis. Germline BRCA2 mutations in female carriers confer a cumulative breast cancer risk at age 70 years of 49% (95% CI: 40?57%), an ovarian cancer risk of 18% (95% CI: 13?23%), and a moderate increased risk of pancreatic cancer (Chen and Parmigiani, 2007). Although the available evidence is not sufficient to decisively conclude that the clinical outcome of women with BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer differs significantly from those of women with sporadic tumours, BRCA1-associated breast cancer often manifests adverse outcome features. Establishment of pre-clinical models, which accurately reflect the genetic and phenotypic features of primary tumours, and their response to treatment, is an important step in identifying novel therapeutic targets and testing new treatment modalities. New strategies may take advantage of the specific DNA repair defects inherent in BRCA-deficient cells, such as the defect in homologous recombination. In fact, most of the insights into the functions of the BRCA2 protein have included key insights from studies of mice by the use of gene targeting and from studies of altered mouse embryonic cells (Evers and Jonkers, 2006). BRCA2 has a key role in DNA double-strand break repair and cell-cycle control. BRCA2-related defects are associated with chromosomal abnormalities, a hallmark of the genomic instability that could foster tumourigenesis. Moreover, BRCA2 participates in the regulation of mitosis and cytokinesis that contribute to numerical chromosomal stability. Although conventional, non-conditional, mouse mutants might be used to model familial forms of cancer, they do not mimic sporadic tumourigenesis because the initiating mutation is present in all cells of the body, including those that constitute the tumour microenvironment. Moreover, embryonic lethality and development of non-epithelial tumours are another important limitation of genetically mutated Brca2 mice. Some murine Brca2 mutant mammary tumour models develop mammary tumours with histopathological features that are significantly different to their human counterparts. Although some studies report a strikingly similar histopathology in BRCA1 null breast tumours from mice and humans (Dennis, 1999; Xu et al, 1999), their relevance to the human situation remains to be demonstrated. The most used human BRCA2-mutated model is the CAPAN1 pancreatic cell line that is mainly used to understand drug resistance in BRCA1/2 mutation carrier, as well as in defining functionally important domains within BRCA2 (Edwards et al, 2008). To date, only one BRCA2-mutated breast cancer xenografts (MX1) is available, (Donawho et al, 2007) but its characterisation has not been described in detail. Genetic testing to identify BRCA1/2 mutations is widely available and commonly employed. As a result, increasing numbers of women are aware that they are mutation carriers at the time of their cancer diagnosis. Unfortunately, current knowledge is not sufficient to mandate specific local or systemic treatments that are tailored to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. In fact, the available studies examining the issue of whether BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer should be treated differently from sporadically occurring, non-familial disease are almost exclusively retrospective and limited by small size and various ascertainment biases. Recently, inhibitors of the DNA repair proteins, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and 2 (PARP1/2), have been shown to be selectively cytotoxic to tumour cells with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deficiency. Preclinical data, including that generated with a limited array of tumour cell line xenografts, suggest that PARP inhibitors can act as single agents to selectively kill cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, and phase I clinical trial results confirm that PARP inhibitors have some single-agent activity in cancers with BRCA1/2 mutations (Fong et al, 2009). However, little is known about the long-term effects of these drugs and it seems likely that some tumours may have de novo resistance or acquired resistance (Ashworth, 2008). Thus, definitive answers remain elusive, and preclinical evaluation of new targeted therapy is limited by the lack of suitable preclinical models (Robson, 2007a). Here, we report the establishment and characterisation of a novel xenograft, human breast cancer xenograft (HBCx-17) established from a breast cancer in a woman carrying a BRCA2 germline mutation. We show that this xenograft accurately reflects the genetic and the phenotypic features of the primary tumour, thus providing a new model to test new therapies for BRCA2-mutated patients. Materials and methods.  Animals and establishment of tumour xenografts. The breast cancer specimen was obtained with informed consent from the patient undergoing surgery. Fresh tumour fragments were grafted into the interscapular fat pad of 8?12-week-old female Swiss nude mice, under avertin anaesthesia. Mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free animal housing (Institut Curie, Paris, France) and received oestrogen (8\u00a5\u00ecgml ?1) diluted in drinking water. Xenografts appeared at the graft site about 1 month after grafting. One xenograft was subsequently transplanted from mouse to mouse and stocked frozen in DMSO-fetal calf serum solution or frozen dried in nitrogen for further studies, and a fragment was fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 10% formol for histological studies. The experimental protocol and animal housing were in accordance with institutional guidelines as put forth by the French Ethical Committee (Agreement B75-05?18, France).  Histology and IHC. The morphology of patients' tumour tissue and of the xenograft was compared using paraffin-embedded sections and standard protocols (Vincent-Salomon et al, 2007). Tumours were removed from mice and immediately fixed in a 10% formol/PBS solution. Determination of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, ERBB2, Ki67, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status by IHC was done according to previously published protocols (Vincent-Salomon et al, 2007). To search for spontaneous lung metastasis of the HBCx-17 xenograft, mice were killed when the tumour reached an ethical size (about 2500mm 3), and lungs were formalin-fixed in-toto for histological evaluation.  Compounds and therapeutic assays. Doxorubicin, 2mgkg ?1 (Adriamycin, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Paris, France), and cyclophosphamide, 100mgkg ?1 (Endoxan, Baxter, Maurepas, France), diluted in 0.9% NaCl, and docetaxel, 20mgkg ?1 (Taxotere, Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France), diluted in its specific excipient, were given by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route at 3-week intervals. Ifosfamide, 90mgkg ?1 (Holoxan, Baxter) was given by i.p. route on three consecutive days every 3 weeks. Cisplatin, 1mgkg ?1 (Mylan, Hoeilaart, Belgium) was diluted in 0.9% NaCl and given weekly by i.p. route. Capecitabine (Xeloda, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 540mg per kg per day was diluted in glucose 5% and given per os in two administrations a day. Radiotherapy was administered locally with one dose of 8Gy or two weekly fraction doses of 8 and 7Gy, respectively, for a total dose of 15Gy. Irradiation experiments were done using a caesium source having a dose rate of 2.15Gy per min. Therapeutic assessments were performed as described elsewhere (Marangoni et al, 2007). Briefly, tumour volume was calculated as V=axb 2/2, a being the largest diameter and b the smallest. Treatment was initiated when tumours in each group achieved an average volume of \u00a1\u00ad170?200mm 3. For each tumour, Vs were reported to the initial volume as relative tumour volume (RTV). Means (and s.e.) of RTV in the same treatment group were calculated, and growth curves were established as a function of time. Optimal tumour growth inhibition (TGI) of treated tumours vs controls was calculated as the ratio of the mean RTV in treated group to the mean RTV in the control group at the same time. Statistical significance of TGI was calculated by the paired Student's t-test, by comparing the individual RTVs in the treated and control groups. Mice were ethically killed when the tumour volume reached about 2500mm 3.  DNA sequencing. Screening for BRCA2 point and small size mutations was performed through analysis of genomic DNA from patient's tumour. In all, 100ng of DNA was amplified using Taq ABgene 0.025U\u00a5\u00ecl ?1 (ABgene UK, ref: http://www.abgene.com), 4 \u00a1\u00bf 0.2m dNTPs, 1.5m MgCl 2, and 0.3\u00a5\u00ec of each primer in a final reaction volume of 50\u00a5\u00ecl. Amplification was performed with an initial denaturation step at 94\u00a1\u00c6C for 5min followed by 35 PCR cycles: denaturation at 94\u00a1\u00c6C for 30s, annealing at 54\u00a1\u00c6C for 30s, and elongation at 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 30s. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified (Macherey Nagel, Duren, Germany), and sequenced using one of the PCR primers (usually the forward primer, except in the case of poor sequence quality). Big Dye Cycle Sequencing Reactions and an ABI3130XL automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Seqscape (Applied Biosystems) software was used for sequence analysis.  Genotypage. Allelic loss was analysed by amplification of two microsatellite markers flanking the BRCA2 gene: D13S260 and D13S1701. Germline DNA, obtained from a blood sample, and tumour and xenograft DNA were compared. In all, 100ng of DNA was amplified using AmpliTaq Gold 5U\u00a5\u00ecl ?1 (Applied Biosystems), 4 \u00a1\u00bf 0.2m dNTPs, 1.5m MgCl 2, and 0.3\u00a5\u00ec of each primer in a final reaction volume of 10\u00a5\u00ecl. Amplification was performed with an initial denaturation step at 94\u00a1\u00c6C for 5min followed by 30 PCR cycles: denaturation at 94\u00a1\u00c6C for 30s, annealing at 55\u00a1\u00c6C for 30s, and elongation at 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 30s. A total of 1\u00a5\u00ecl of PCR products was mixed with 19\u00a5\u00ecl of Formamide Hi-Di (Applied Biosystems) and 0.5\u00a5\u00ecl of Genescan 400 ROX Size Standard (PE Applied Biosystems) and separated on ABI3130XL automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Genemapper (Applied Biosystems) software was used for genotype analysis.  Quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments. Quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments is a sensitive method for the detection of large gene deletions or duplications. It is based on the simultaneous amplification of short genomic fragments using dye-labelled primers under quantitative conditions (Casilli et al, 2002; Tournier et al, 2004). PCR products were analysed on a sequencing platform used in the fragment analysis mode, where both peak heights and areas are proportional to the quantity of template present for each target sequence. Nine amplicons of BRCA2 between 180 and 300bp were amplified in the same multiplex reaction. As an internal control, we included in each reaction a fragment of different gene in which deletion was not expected (MLH1 exon 14). One primer from each primer pair was 5\u00a1\u00c7-labeled with 6-FAM fluorochrome. In all, 100ng of two genomic DNA from the xenograft, two normal control, and one BRCA2-mutated control were amplified in a final volume of 25\u00a5\u00ecl, including 0.06?0.24\u00a5\u00ecmoll ?1 for each primer and 12.5\u00a5\u00ecl of QIAGEN master mix (QIAGEN multiplex PCR Kit). After an initial denaturation step, samples underwent 23 cycles (30s at 95\u00a1\u00c6C, 40s at 54\u00a1\u00c6C, and 60s at 72\u00a1\u00c6C). After the multiplex reactions, the DNA fragments were separated on an ABI3130XL automated sequencer and analysed using Genemapper Software (Applied Biosystems). For this analysis, we used visual sample-to-control comparison. We estimated allele dosage by superimposing the electropherogram of the tested sample onto the corresponding image for a control DNA sample, after adjusting the vertical scale of the internal control amplicon. Allelic losses of one or more amplicons are represented by a two-fold reduction in the intensity (peak heights) of an amplicon of the sample analysed. Allelic duplication of one or more amplicons is represented by a 0.5-fold rise in the intensity (peak heights) of an amplicon of the sample analysed.  Protein analysis. Whole-cell protein extracts were prepared from tumour samples by homogenising the tissue in RIPA buffer (10m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150m NaCl, 1m EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors). Protein concentrations were measured with Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating Protein G beads (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany), 1?2mg of precleared cell lysate, and anti-BRCA2 mouse monoclonal Ab-1 antibody (dilution 1:200; Merck) overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. Beads were subsequently washed three times in cold lysis buffer, after which 2 \u00a1\u00bf loading buffer was added and the samples were boiled for 2min before SDS?PAGE. For western blotting analysis, lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on Novex precast gels (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) and immunoblotted overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C with the following antibodies: anti-BRCA2 and anti-\u00a5\u00e2-tubulin, T4026 (Sigma). This was followed by incubation with anti-IgG-horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescent detection (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). As a control, full-length BRCA2 was detected in lysates generated from 293T cells.  Detection of ER\u00a5\u00e1, Ki67, and ERBB2 by quantitative RT?PCR. Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were done as previously described from 1\u00a5\u00ecg total RNA (de Cremoux et al, 2004). ER\u00a5\u00e1, Ki67, and ERBB2 transcripts were quantified using real-time quantitative reverse transcription?PCR (RT?PCR) assays. The nucleotide and probe sequences, and the conditions of PCR have been previously described (de Cremoux et al, 2007). Results were expressed as N-fold differences in target gene expression relative to a reference gene defined as \u00a1\u00aeN target'.  Array-based CGH. A genome-wide resource of 5244 fluorescence in situ hybridisation mapped, sequenced BAC and PAC clones, verified for gene and marker content were represented as immobilised DNA targets on glass slides for array-based CGH analysis, allowing a mean resolution of 0.5Mb all along the genome. Each clone was spotted in quadruplicate on a slide prepared by Integragen (Evry, France) and developed by the Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unit U830. After extraction, 1.5\u00a5\u00ecg of each test and control DNA samples were digested with DpnII enzyme (Ozyme, Saint-Quentin en Yveline, France) and purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). They were then labelled by random priming using a Bioprime DNA labelling kit (Invitrogen) with the appropriate cyanine dye (Cy3 or Cy5; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The control and test DNA were coprecipitated with Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen), denatured, and resuspended in hybridisation buffer (50% formamide). Competitive cohybridisation was done on CGH array slides. After 24-h hybridisation, slides were washed with SDS and saline citrate, dried, and scanned using a 4000B scan (Axon, Orleans, CA, USA). Image analysis was done with Genepix 5.1 software (Axon) and processed using a software developed at the Curie Institute (La Rosa et al, 2006). Any BAC with less than two replicates flagged for not fulfilling qualitative spot criteria was excluded. A ratio <0.8 was considered as a loss, a ratio >1.2 was considered as a gain, and a ratio >1.5 was considered as amplification (Auger et al, 2006). Data analysis was based on the normalised ratios of Cy5/Cy3 signals observed for each BAC clone that previously passed the flag assessment procedure. For autosomal chromosomes, the loss of a given locus was defined by a ratio 0.8, a gain was defined by a ratio 1.2 and <2.0, and an amplicon was defined by a ratio 2.0. For X chromosomes, a loss was defined by a ratio 1.2, a gain was defined by a ratio 1.7, and an amplicon was defined by a ratio 2.5. The data analysis was done according to previously published protocols (Vincent-Salomon et al, 2007).  Clinical features of the patient. The BRCA2 mutation carrier from whom the HBCx-17 xenograft was obtained was a 37-year-old woman who was affected at 32 years of age for a first invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of grade III that was treated with surgery, FEC100, and radiotherapy. After 6 years, she developed a contralateral IDC and was treated by upfront surgery followed by six cycles of docetaxel and radiotherapy. The xenograft was established from the second carcinoma. The patient tumour was C-ERBB2, oestrogen-, and progesterone-receptor negative, with a high mitotic index. The patient had a strong familial history of breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1/2 gene testing, performed with the informed consent of the patient, identified a mutation in the BRCA2 gene: c.6033_6034delTT; p.ser2012GlnfsX5. Results.  Histology of xenograft and comparison with patient tumour. Histopathological analysis was performed with the primary tumour and the xenograft HBCx-17 at passage 6. As shown in Figure 1A and B, the histology of the original tumour was conserved in the xenograft. Indeed, HBCx-17 showed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma with typical loss of tubule formation, prominent nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic activity. Irregular infiltration of stroma was observed in both patient and xenografts. Assessment of tumour proliferation using Ki67 staining showed a high proliferative rate in the primary tumour, which was increased in the xenograft (Figure 1C and D). Both primary and xenograft tumours were negative for CK5 and CK6 (data not shown) but positive for CK14 expression as shown in Figure 1E and F. Both tumour sample and HBCx-17 are negative for ERBB2 and oestrogen, and progesteron receptor, and the clinical sample presented a strong EGFR staining that the xenograft did not (data not shown). To search for spontaneous lung metastasis of the HBCx-17 xenograft, mice lungs were analysed by histochemistry. Figure 1G and H show two examples of small metastasis: clusters of tumour cells obstructed the lumen of a small number of pulmonary arterioles (cancerous emboli), without evident effraction of the arteriolar media. Lung metastases were detected in 23% of mice (six positive animals on 26).  CGH array and genomic alterations. The clinical sample and xenografted tumours at passages 0, 6, and 8 were characterised for genetic parameters using CGH array technique (Figure 2). Comparative genomic hybridisation array analysis showed a very high number of alterations and quite similar gene copy number changes. The genomic profiles of the primary tumour and different passages in the xenograft were very similar, sharing large regions of DNA amplifications. Common DNA gains and deletions are described in the Tables 1 and ?and2.2. These amplifications are described in the Table 1 such as amplicons of chromosome 1q and 8p.  Gene expression profiles. The histological classification of the HBCx-17 as a triple-negative tumour was confirmed by quantitative RT?PCR analysis of the ER, PR, and ERBB2 receptors (Table 3). Both the clinical sample and the xenograft tumours were negative for the three receptors. By contrast, the basal-like CK5 and CK6 were not expressed, but the classification of basal-like breast cancer was done on CK14 expression as determined by IHC (Figure 1). The TP53 status was found to be mutated in the xenograft tumour as defined by the functional Fasay Assay (data not shown).  BRCA2 alterations. DNA sequencing of the primary tumour, and P0 and P8 from the HBCx-17 xenograft showed the presence of the germline BRCA2 mutation identified in the patient (c.6033_6034delTT; p.Ser2012GlnfsX5; Figure 3A). The informativity of the two studied markers located at the BRCA2 locus, D13S260 and D13S1701, has allowed detecting the presence of the two alleles at the germline DNA level, whereas the primary tumour and the xenograft DNA showed loss of one allele. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the BRCA2 locus was confirmed in the xenograft at P0 by using two flanking microsatellite markers for BRCA2, D13S260, and D13S1701 (Figure 3B). To assess the LOH consequence on the BRCA2 protein, a protein analysis was performed by western blot on cell lysate obtained from a control breast tumour xenograft (having no BRCA2 mutation) and from the HBCx-17 xenograft. As shown in Figure 3C, the BRCA2-mutated xenograft lysate contains a truncated form of the BRCA2 protein and has lost the wild-type protein. Quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments was used to determine BRCA2 copy number. Figure 3D shows the electrophoregrams of germline DNA, and P0 and P7 DNA (orange and black). Mutated (BRCA2 duplicated) DNAs were used as controls (green and red, respectively). Xenograft samples and control samples were perfectly superimposed after normalisation, indicating a duplication of BRCA2-mutated allele.  Tumour responses of xenograft to conventional chemotherapies and radiotherapy. The HBCx-17 xenograft growth parameters (tumour latency and tumour take) are published (Marangoni et al, 2007). Tumour responses to standard chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer and radiotherapy have been studied. As shown in Figure 4A, the HBCx-17 xenograft was a high responder to AC, with five out of eight complete regressions and a TGI of 98%. The HBCx-17 model was also sensitive to capecitabin-based treatment with a TGI of 98% 4 weeks after start of the treatment. No response was observed to docetaxel, as shown in Figure 4B. Cisplatin/ifosfamide combination gave also an important growth inhibition (98%) with 7 out of 10 complete regressions at day 50 (Figure 4C). Radiotherapy assays were done with a caesium irradiation source. The mice received either 8 or 15Gy locally delivered in two fractions of 7 and 8Gy. The xenograft was a high responder to irradiation with a TGI of 73 and 75% at 8 and 15Gy, respectively (Figure 4C). Discussion. In this work, we report the characterisation of a human breast tumour xenograft obtained from a woman carrying a BRCA2 mutation. The basal-like morphology of the patient tumour was conserved in the xenograft including the stroma component and tissular architecture. Ki67 staining was higher in the xenograft's tumour than in the primary tumour, suggesting that tumour engrafting may have selected highly proliferating cancer cells. Studies on large series of BRCA2-associated breast cancers indicate that these tumours are predominantly high-grade IDCs of no special marker subtype, and that they are more often oestrogen- and progesterone-receptor positive (Lakhani et al, 2002; Brekelmans et al, 2007; Palacios et al, 2008). As the majority of BRCA2-deficient cells, the tumour cells contain only the truncated BRCA2 protein, indicating that LOH has occurred as a consequence of an inactivating mutation in the second allele. This is what normally happens in most BRCA2-mutated tumour, where inactivation of the wild-type allele occurs by LOH, abolishing normal protein expression (Smith et al, 1992; Collins et al, 1995). In addition, multiplex PCR of short fragment showed that loss of the wild-type gene was associated with duplication of the mutated BRCA2 gene. LOH and copy number abnormalities are often associated with BRCA1, and BRCA2-associated breast or ovarian cancer (Staff et al, 2000). Concordance between the clinical sample and xenograft was also shown by CGH array analysis. Genetic profiles were very similar not only between the patient tumour and the xenografts, but also when comparing xenografts at different passages, suggesting that although extremely altered, the HBCx-17 xenograft genetic profile was stable during subsequent passages. The clinical sample and the xenograft tumours present some of the chromosome alterations that have already been frequently described in the genomic profiles of BRCA2-mutated tumours, as gains of 8q and 20q, and loss of 13q (Palacios et al, 2008). The amplification of the MYST3 and AP3M2 genes was already described like recurrent amplicons associated with reduced survival duration in breast cancer (Chin et al, 2006). Gains in the regions 1q32?q41, 8q22.1?24.3, and 20q12?q13, and loss in the region 8p23.3?p21.2 occur in both the primary and xenograft tumours and have also been found in primary BRCA2 tumours by different authors (Gronwald et al, 2005; Jonsson et al, 2005). However, none of these regions have been confirmed in large number of patients and in studies of independent collections of families, and more extensive studies are necessary to find alterations specific to BRCA1/2-mutated tumours. There is a significant body of preclinical data that supports the hypothesis BRCA1/2-deficient cells are more sensitive to certain chemotherapy agents than are the cells with intact BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins (Foulkes, 2006). In line with this, the HBCx-17 xenograft showed a pronounced sensitivity to anthracycline-based chemotherapy with >50% of mice showing complete response (no tumour recurrence), as well as to cisplatin and ifosfamide combination. Although BRCA2 deficiency has not been extensively studied, some previous works showed that decreased BRCA2 function is associated with increased in vitro sensitivity to cisplatin, mitomycin, doxorubicin, and etoposide (Foulkes, 2006; Robson, 2007a). The HBCx-17 xenograft was highly resistant to docetaxel. Although some experiments raise the possibility that BRCA1-deficient cells may be resistant to anti-cancer agents targeting the microtubules (such as vinca alkaloids and taxanes), no preclinical in vivo studies have ever demonstrated taxane resistance in BRCA2-deficient cells (Foulkes, 2006; Robson, 2007b). In the same way, some recent clinical analyses suggest that primary resistance to docetaxel-based chemotherapy correlates with BRCA1 mutations' high frequency. No indications exist for breast tumours occurring in BRCA2 mutation carrier. Our data suggest that, like BRCA1, wild-type BRCA2 could be required for in vivo response to mitotic spindle poisons and that the docetaxel resistance could be attributed to BRCA1/2 involvement in the taxane-induced stress response pathway. In the clinic, the available evidence is not sufficient to conclude that BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer is differentially sensitive to specific conventional chemotherapeutic agents. In the adjuvant setting, the choice of treatment regimen is not modified based on the presence of such a predisposition. Clinical trials are in progress to further address this issue. Nevertheless, the outcome of hereditary breast cancer remains poor, addressing the questions of potential new strategies that take advantage of the specific DNA repair defects inherent in BRCA-deficient cells. The inhibition of PARP1 potentiates the activity of DNA-damaging agents, such as alkylating drugs, platinums, topoisomerase inhibitors, and radiation in in vitro and in vivo models. Tumours with DNA repair defects, such as those arising from patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, are more sensitive to PARP inhibition (Bryant et al, 2005; Farmer et al, 2005; Fong et al, 2009). In this context, the HBCx-17 model could improve preclinical assays of PARP inhibitors that are usually done in BRCA1/2 knockout mice or in pancreatic cancer cells. Different agents are undergoing phase I and II clinical trials in BRCA1/2-associated breast and ovarian cancer, and new compounds are entering in the early preclinical settings. In this perspective, the establishment of this new BRCA2 breast cancer xenograft reproducing, over successive generations, the patient's characteristics in terms of histology, genetic profile, and biological characteristics may contribute to the preclinical development of innovative therapeutics regimens.

                "text": "Pre-existence and clonal selection of MET amplification in EGFR mutant NSCLC\tMET amplification activates ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling in EGFR mutant lung cancers, and causes resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors. We demonstrate that MET activation by its ligand, HGF, also induces drug resistance, but through GAB1 signaling. Using high-throughput FISH analyses in both cell lines and in lung cancer patients, we identify subpopulations of cells with MET amplification prior to drug exposure. Surprisingly, HGF accelerates the development of MET amplification both in vitro and in vivo. EGFR kinase inhibitor resistance, due to either MET amplification or autocrine HGF production, was cured in vivo by combined EGFR and MET inhibition. These findings highlight the potential to prospectively identify treatment naive EGFR mutant lung cancer patients who will benefit from initial combination therapy. Introduction. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib are effective clinical therapies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR activating mutations (Asahina et al., 2006; Inoue et al., 2006; Paz-Ares et al., 2006; Sequist et al., 2008; Tamura et al., 2008). A recent phase III clinical trial demonstrated that patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC had superior outcomes with gefitinib treatment compared to standard first line cytotoxic chemotherapy (Mok et al., 2008). However, despite these dramatic benefits from EGFR TKIs in this genetically defined cohort, all of these patients ultimately develop resistance (referred to as acquired resistance herein) to gefitinib and erlotinib. Two mechanisms of acquired resistance have been validated in patients. Secondary mutations in EGFR itself, including the EGFR T790M \u00a1\u00b0gatekeeper\u00a1\u00b1 mutation is observed in 50% of resistance cases, and amplification of the MET oncogene is observed in 20% of resistance cases (Balak et al., 2006; Bean et al., 2007; Engelman et al., 2007b; Kobayashi et al., 2005; Kosaka et al., 2006; Pao et al., 2005). Both resistance mechanisms lead to maintenance of ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling in the presence of gefitinib (reviewed in (Engelman and Janne, 2008)). In addition to these genetic alterations, activation of IGF-1R\u00a5\u00e2/IRS-1 signaling through loss of IGF binding proteins also drives gefitinib resistance in EGFR wild-type cancer cell lines (Guix et al., 2008). Additionally, a recent study suggested that the MET ligand, HGF, can promote short-term resistance in two EGFR mutated cancer cell lines (Yano et al., 2008). Both ligand-dependent resistance mechanisms maintain PI3K/AKT activation despite EGFR inhibition. However, differences between IGF and HGF driven resistance in terms of potency and activation of downstream signaling pathways have yet to be thoroughly examined. Furthermore, the contribution of HGF, if any, to gefitinib resistance mediated by MET amplification is unknown. Strategies for overcoming acquired resistance to gefitinib are now undergoing clinical evaluation. In preclinical studies, the EGFR T790M mutation can be overcome by second-generation, irreversible EGFR inhibitors (Engelman et al., 2007a; Kobayashi et al., 2005; Riely, 2008). In addition, the growth of EGFR mutant cancers with MET amplification can be inhibited by combined treatment with EGFR and MET kinase inhibitors (Bean et al., 2007; Engelman et al., 2007b). Indeed, there are now clinical trials assessing both irreversible EGFR inhibitors and a combination of MET and EGFR inhibitors in patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib/erlotinib. Further, clinical activity of the irreversible EGFR inhibitor, PF00299804, has been observed in NSCLC patients that have developed acquired resistance to gefitinib/erlotinib (Janne et al., 2008). As an alternative strategy, to delay or avoid the emergence of resistance, there is increased enthusiasm to utilize agents effective against specific resistance mechanisms as initial systemic therapies. For example, PF00299804 is now being assessed in a phase II clinical trial of EGFR TKI naive patients. However, there are currently no methods to predict the specific resistance mechanism that a cancer will develop. In the current study, we modeled in vitro resistance to PF00299804 in the TKI sensitive EGFR mutant NSCLC cell line HCC827 (Engelman et al., 2006; Engelman et al., 2007b; Ogino et al., 2007) . In addition, we evaluated the potency of the MET ligand, HGF, to promote resistance to EGFR TKIs and determined whether MET amplification pre-exists in a subpopulation of cells prior to treatment with a TKI. Results. MET amplification causes resistance to the irreversible EGFR inhibitor PF00299804 by activating ERBB3 signaling. We generated in vitro resistant clones of HCC827 cells to the irreversible pan-ERBB kinase inhibitor, PF00299804, using previously described methods (Engelman et al., 2006; Engelman et al., 2007b). HCC827 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of PF00299804, starting with 1nM, until they were able to proliferate freely in 1 M PF00299804, which occurred after 6 months of drug selection. This concentration was chosen because it is ~ 1000 fold greater than the IC 50 for growth inhibition of HCC827 cells and approximately 5 times greater than the serum concentration of PF00299804 observed in NSCLC patients in the phase I clinical trial (Janne et al., 2008; Schellens et al., 2007). Five independent clones were isolated and expanded for further studies. All five HCC827 PF00299804 resistant (PFR) clones were resistant to PF00299804 in vitro (Figure 1A and data not shown). No secondary EGFR mutations (e.g. T790M) were detected in any of the clones (data not shown). We next examined the effects of PF00299804 on EGFR, ERBB3, AKT and ERK phosphorylation in the HCC827 PFR clones. Unlike in parental HCC827 cells, ERBB3 activation as well as downstream PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling is maintained in the presence of PF00299804 in HCC827 PFR cells (Figure 1B). We also observed increased total MET protein in the HCC827 PFR cells, and combined MET and EGFR inhibition down-regulated ERBB3, AKT and ERK phosphorylation as well as the modest EGFR phosphorylation that was maintained in the presence of PF00299804 alone (Figure 1B). This behavior following treatment with PF00299804 alone or in combination with a MET inhibitor is similar to that observed in gefitinib resistant HCC827 cells (HCC827 GR cells), which were generated in an analogous manner and contained a focal amplification in chromosome 7 harboring the MET oncogene (Engelman et al., 2007b). Given the similarities in the HCC827 PFR and GR cells following treatment with either PF00299804 or gefitinib, respectively, we determined whether the addition of a MET inhibitor would overcome resistance to PF00299804. We used both a tool compound PHA-665,752 and the MET inhibitor PF2341066 currently undergoing clinical development (Figure 1C, upper and data not shown) (Zou et al., 2007). The combination of PF00299804 and a MET inhibitor effectively inhibited the growth of HCC827 PFR cells while neither agent alone led to growth inhibition (Figure 1C, upper and data not shown). In addition, the combination of gefitinib and PF2341066 also effectively inhibited the growth of HCC827 PFR cells (Figure 1C, lower). These findings further suggest that the resistance mechanism in the HCC827 PFR cells is not unique or dependent on the differences between reversible (gefitinib) or irreversible (PF00299804) EGFR inhibitors but rather due solely to MET amplification. We also evaluated the effects of the irreversible EGFR inhibitor PF00299804 and the MET inhibitor PF-2341066 in an HCC827 PFR xenograft model. Treatment with PF00299804 alone was modestly more effective than treatment with PF2341066 alone, but the tumors demonstrated resistance to PF00299804. However, combined MET and EGFR inhibition completely inhibited tumor growth and produced complete responses (p<0.0001; Figure 1D). In fact, the combination treatment was discontinued after 56 days (Figure 1D; arrow) and no tumor re-growth has been observed to date in any of the xenografts (after more than 35 weeks off therapy) (Figure 1D), suggesting that the mice have been cured. We next determined whether the increase in MET protein expression was due to MET amplification in the HCC827 PFR cells (Figure 2A). All of the PFR clones contained at least a four fold amplification of MET, similar to the amplification previously observed in the gefitinib resistant HCC827 (HCC827 GR) cells ((Engelman et al., 2007b) and Figure 2A). All of the PFR clones also had higher levels of MET protein expression (Figure 2B). Genome-wide SNP analysis revealed that the only area of significant copy number gain in HCC827 PFR cells is on distal chromosome 7, similar to that observed in HCC827 GR cells, and contains the MET oncogene (Figure 2C, D). Furthermore, HCC827 PFR and GR cells share single copy losses of 4p, 5q, 14p, 14q and 19p, but only HCC827 PFR cells have a single copy loss of 16q. Intriguingly, further examination of the region of MET amplification on distal chromosome 7 in both set of clones showed that, although the copy number changes within the amplicons are not identical in the HCC827 GR and PFR cells, the size and the proximal borders of the amplicons are very similar (Figure 2D). Together these findings, along with the multiple shared regions of single copy genomic loss between the HCC827 PFR and GR cells, suggest that the resistant clones may have arisen from a common origin. HGF activates PI3K/AKT signaling through GAB1 and leads to gefitinib resistance. MET amplification was previously shown to cause gefitinib resistance in HCC827 GR cells (Engelman et al., 2007b). We investigated whether activation of MET signaling by its ligand, HGF, could also cause resistance to gefitinib and other ERBB-targeted therapies. In a 72 hour survival assay, HGF induced substantial gefitinib resistance in HCC827 cells that was abolished by the addition of PHA-665,752 (Figure 3A). Furthermore, HGF maintained PI3K/AKT, mTORC1 and ERK activation in the presence of gefitinib in a dose-dependent manner that mirrored its capacity to maintain cell viability (Figures 3B, C). We also determined the capacity for HGF to maintain downstream signaling and cell viability in other EGFR and HER2 addicted cancers. In cell lines with EGFR exon 19 deletions (HCC827 and PC-9), and an EGFR-driven lung cancer cell line carrying the T790M resistance mutation (H1975), HGF restored PI3K/AKT, mTORC1 and ERK signaling, despite continued EGFR inhibition in the presence of 1\u00a5\u00ecM gefitinib or PF00299804 (Figure 3D). HGF also rescued each of these cell lines from TKI-induced cell death after 72 hours (Figure 4A and Figure S1A-E). In contrast to the EGFR addicted cancers, HGF did not rescue HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines from the effects of lapatinib (Figure 4A and Figure S1F, G), nor did it rescue AKT or mTORC1 signaling in either HER2 driven cell line (Figure 3D). Thus, the capacity to rescue cell viability appears to strongly correlate with capacity to restore downstream signaling, especially along the PI3K/AKT pathway. We suspect that HGF had a minimal effect in BT-474 and SKBR3 cells because these cell lines have lower levels of MET expression compared to the other EGFR-driven cell lines that were tested. To confirm the ability of HGF to induce resistance to EGFR TKIs, we introduced the human HGF gene into HCC827 cells (HCC827-HGF). Parental HCC827 cells secrete undetectable levels of HGF; however, HCC827-HGF cells express HGF protein (Figure S2A) and secrete approximately 70ng/mL HGF into the culture medium (data not shown). Further, HCC827-HGF cells are gefitinib resistant (Figure S2B) and maintain PI3K/AKT, ERK and mTOR signaling in the presence of gefitinib (Figure S2A); however gefitinib sensitivity is restored with the addition of a MET inhibitor (Figure S2B). We also evaluated the capacity of HGF to induce gefitinib resistance in vivo using an HCC827-HGF xenograft model. We have previously shown that parental HCC827 cells demonstrate complete responses to gefitinib in vivo (Engelman et al., 2006; Engelman et al., 2007a). However, the HCC827-HGF xenografts demonstrated resistance (Figure 3E). Treatment with gefitinib alone was slightly more effective than no treatment or treatment with PF2341066 alone, but only the combination of gefitinib and PF2341066 completely inhibited tumor growth (p < 0.001; gefitinib vs. gefitinib/PF2341066; Figure 3E). Indeed, 3 out of 4 mice were cured after 70 days of combined treatment with no evidence of re-growth 70 days after stopping treatment. Since HGF ligand appeared to be a potent inducer of resistance to RTK inhibitors, we compared its efficacy to that of IGF ligand, which we had previously found to cause gefitinib resistance in A431 cells (Guix et al., 2008). Although IGF exposure led to significant rescue from gefitinib-induced cell death in A431 cells, and partial rescue in HN11 EGFR wild-type cells, the other five cell lines tested remained sensitive to ERBB inhibition despite the presence of IGF (Figure 4A and Figure S1). Interestingly, in three of those cell lines (BT-474, HCC827 and H1975), IGF was unable to maintain PI3K/AKT signaling despite potent activation of IGR-1R\u00a5\u00e2 (Figure 4B and Table S1). Of note, IGF did not restore ERK phosphorylation in any of the six cell lines examined, including those in which it induced IGF-1R\u00a5\u00e2 and/or PI3K/AKT activation (Figure 4B). Thus, unlike IGF, HGF may be more potent at promoting resistance because it leads to activation of both the PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways. Unexpectedly, IGF restored PI3K/AKT signaling in PC-9 cells, but these cells still remained highly sensitive to EGFR-inhibition after 72 hours (Figure 4A and Figure S1C). This disconnect between maintenance of PI3K/AKT signaling and lack of an effect on cell viability is not due to a brief, transient restoration of downstream signaling, as we observed that IGF maintained PI3K signaling in PC-9 cells for at least 24 hours in the presence of gefitinib (data not shown). MET amplified gefitinib resistant HCC827 GR cells utilize ERBB3 as the primary adaptor to activate PI3K/AKT signaling (Engelman et al., 2007b). Although HGF treatment was sufficient to rescue AKT phosphorylation in several EGFR-driven cell lines in the presence of TKIs, ERBB3 phosphorylation was not restored (Figure 3D). This suggests that HGF-induced MET activation utilizes an adaptor other than ERBB3 to activate PI3K signaling. To determine which PI3K adaptors were being utilized to maintain HGF-mediated PI3K signaling, we immunoprecipitated the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and examined co-precipitating phosphotyrosine proteins (Engelman et al., 2005; Engelman et al., 2007b; Guix et al., 2008). As expected, treatment with a TKI disrupted the association of ERBB3 (and other phosphotyrosine proteins) with p85, and the addition of HGF did not restore the interaction (Figure 5A). However, we observed that HGF potently induced the association between p85 and Grb2 associated binder 1 (GAB1), which runs as a broad, highly tyrosine-phophorylated band at approximately 110kDa. To more directly assess if GAB1 mediates HGF-mediated activation of PI3K/AKT signaling and cell viability, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knockdown GAB1 expression in the HCC827 cells. Knockdown of GAB1 reduced HGF-mediated rescue of PI3K/AKT signaling (Figure 5B), and inhibited the ability of HGF to rescue HCC827 cells from gefitinib induced cell death (Figure 5C). Of note, although the addition of HGF leads to substantial loss of GAB1 protein (Figure 5B), the amount of tyrosine phosphorylated GAB1 is dramatically increased (Figure S3), and this facilitates the efficient coupling to PI3K (Figure 5A). Thus, activation of HGF/MET signaling can lead to gefitinib resistance in EGFR mutant cancers by activating PI3K/AKT signaling through two different adaptors: ERBB3 when MET is activated by genomic amplification or GAB1 when MET is activated by HGF. Transient HGF exposure leads to stable ligand-independent gefitinib resistance in HCC827-50GR cells through selection of a pre-exisiting MET amplified clone. Because HGF-induced resistance to EGFR TKIs appears intimately linked to ligand-induced activation of downstream signaling, we hypothesized that long-term resistance would require continuous exposure to HGF. We observed that by replenishing cells with HGF in combination with the EGFR TKI every 3 days, cells continue to be highly resistant indefinitely (data not shown). Thus, we treated each cell line with HGF in the presence of an EGFR inhibitor for 14 days, and then removed HGF, but maintained the cells in the EGFR TKI. Surprisingly, HCC827 cells treated transiently with HGF remained permanently resistant to gefitinib after HGF withdrawal (Figure 6A, B). These stably resistant cells were termed HCC827-50GR (50ng HGF Gefitinib Resistant) cells (Figure 6A). In contrast, HCC827 cells that are not pretreated with HGF, develop gefitinib resistance only after 6 months of gradually increasing concentrations of drug exposure (Engelman et al., 2007b). In addition, when HCC827-50GR cells were grown in media alone (without gefitinib) for eight weeks, these cells (HCC827-50GR (8wksR5)) maintained their resistance (Figure S4A). Treatment with HGF alone (without gefitinib) for 14 days did not yield stably resistant cells (Figure S4C and Table S2). Thus, lasting resistance conferred by transient HGF requires the selective pressure of gefitinib during ligand exposure. Stably resistant HCC827-50GR cells maintained PI3K/AKT, mTORC1 and ERK activation in the presence of gefitinib. Surprisingly, ERBB3 also remained phosphorylated in HCC827-50GR cells treated with gefitinib (Figure S4B), which suggests that although initial HGF-mediated resistance mechanisms utilized GAB1 to activate PI3K/AKT signaling, the ligand-independent HCC827-50GR cells utilize ERBB3 to activate PI3K/AKT signaling. This observation suggests that short-term exposure to HGF may lead HCC827 cells to develop or select the same mechanism of stable resistance, through activation of ERBB3/PI3K signaling, as was observed in MET amplified HCC827 GR cells (Engelman et al., 2007b). Unlike the HCC827 cells, several other EGFR-driven cancer cell lines that were made resistant to EGFR TKIs by HGF treatment did not maintain stable ligand-independent resistance after the withdrawal of HGF (Figure S4D-F and Table S3). These findings suggest that HCC827 cells are uniquely poised to develop stable ligand-independent resistance. Stably-resistant HCC827-50GR cells had increased total MET protein levels compared to parental cells and maintained MET phosphorylation in the presence of gefitinib (Figure S4B), mimicking MET amplified HCC827 GR cells. Therefore, we examined MET copy number using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and found significant MET copy number gains in HCC827-50GR cells compared to parental cells (Figure 6C). Quantitative PCR demonstrated a three to four fold amplification of MET, similar to the HCC827 GR and PFR cells (data not shown). These results suggest that MET amplification may be driving ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling and gefitinib resistance in HCC827-50GR cells. To examine this hypothesis, we exposed HCC827-50GR cells to PHA-665,752 alone or in combination with gefitinib. Only the combination of gefitinib and PHA-665,752 resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of viable cells (Figure 6D, upper). In addition, the HCC827-50GR (8wks R5) cells (grown in media without gefitinib for eight weeks) also remained sensitive only to the combination of MET and EGFR inhibition (Figure 6D, lower). Further, treatment with gefitinib in combination with PHA-665,752 completely blocked ERBB3 phosphorylation as well as downstream PI3K/AKT, mTORC1 and ERK signaling in HCC827-50GR and HCC827-50GR(8wks R5) cells (Figure 6E). Taken together, these results suggest that MET inhibition restores EGFR dependence and gefitinib sensitivity in HCC827-50GR cells. These results led us to examine tissue sections from HCC827-HGF xenograft models treated with gefitinib (Figure 3E). Of three tumors that developed gefitinib resistance, one exhibited significant MET amplification (Figure 7A). Thus, MET amplification is also facilitated by HGF in vivo. Because HCC827 GR, PFR and 50GR cells all eventually develop focal MET amplification as a resistance mechanism, we hypothesized that parental HCC827 cells may harbor a pre-existing MET amplified clone. We analyzed 4237 individual HCC827 cell nuclei using high-throughput fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Experimental Procedures) and identified 6 cells (0.14%; 6/4237) that harbored significant MET copy number gains (Figure 7B, C). These results were confirmed in an independent experiment using a second gefitinib sensitive parental HCC827 cell line (HCC827 N1; Figure 7C). We also generated two subclones derived from single cells from the gefitinib sensitive parental HCC827 cell line (HCC827 C1 and C2). Both subclones were sensitive to gefitinib in vitro (data not shown), and each also contained a low frequency population of MET amplified cells (Figure 7C). We further examined the gefitinib sensitive H3255 and PC-9 cells using FISH. Gefitinib resistant clones of both H3255 and PC-9 have been isolated and reported to contain the EGFR secondary resistance mutation T790M but not MET amplification (Engelman et al., 2006; Ogino et al., 2007). We did not detect a subpopulation of MET amplified cells in the H3255 or the PC-9 cells (Figure 7C). We hypothesized that the mechanism by which transient treatment with HGF and gefitinib leads to the generation of MET amplified HCC827-50GR cells is by selecting out this small population of pre-existing MET amplified cells from the parental HCC827 cell population. To test this hypothesis, we spiked unlabeled HCC827 parental cells with 0.1% of either GFP labeled HCC827 cells or GFP labeled MET amplified HCC827 GR6 cells. We treated these two populations with either media alone (no selection) or with gefitinib in combination with HGF. Media was changed and fresh HGF was added every 72 hours, and cells were collected after 19 days for FACS to quantify the percent of cells with GFP expression (Figure S5A). As expected, there was no significant change in the percentage of GFP labeled HCC827 cells at the end of 19 days. However, the percentage of GFP labeled MET amplified HCC827 GR6 cells increased over 300 fold to almost 33% in just over two weeks (Figure 7D). Taken together, these results suggest that HGF exposure in the presence of an EGFR inhibitor leads to the rapid selection of a pre-existing MET amplified clone in the HCC827 cells (Figure S5B). Analyses of tumors with acquired resistance to gefitinib/erlotinib reveal evidence of pre-treatment MET amplification and increased HGF expression in resistant cancers. To determine the clinical implications of these in vitro and in vivo observations, we examined tumor specimens from gefitinib or erlotinib treated EGFR mutant NSCLC patients (Figure 8). All patients had a clinical partial tumor response to gefitinib or erlotinib treatment and subsequently developed clinical drug resistance. We evaluated 27 patients, 16 with paired pre and post geftinib/erlotinib treatment specimens and 11 with drug resistance specimens alone. All specimens, when feasible, were evaluated for MET amplification, HGF expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and presence of EGFR T790M (Figure 8 and Figure S6). We observed EGFR T790M in 55 % (15/27) and MET amplification in 4/27 (15%) of resistant tumor specimens. In patients with paired tumor specimens, HGF expression was higher in the drug resistant specimens compared to pre-treatment specimens (p = 0.025; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In patients with drug resistant specimens alone, HGF expression was similar to that of drug resistant specimens in patients with paired tumor specimens. Together these findings support our in vitro and in vivo studies on HGF mediating resistance to EGFR TKIs. We further evaluated the pre-treatment specimens for evidence of MET amplification. In all 4 patients with MET amplification in the drug resistant specimens, we observed rare (< 1%) tumor cells with MET amplification from the corresponding pre-treatment specimens (Figure 8A, B). In contrast, of 8 cases that had resistant cancers without MET amplification, we observed rare MET amplified tumor cells in only 1 of the corresponding pre-treatment tumor specimen. These findings are consistent with cell line data (Figure 7B, C) where we observed evidence of pre-existing MET amplification only in the cell line that subsequently develops MET amplification as its resistance mechanism. Discussion. Kinase inhibitors have emerged as effective clinical therapies for cancers that exhibit oncogene addiction to a particular kinase. (Demetri et al., 2002; Druker et al., 2001; Inoue et al., 2006; Mok et al., 2008; Sequist et al., 2008). However, the clinical success of treatment with kinase inhibitors is uniformly limited by the development of drug resistance. To date, resistance mechanisms have predominately involved secondary genomic alterations in the target kinase that alter either the physical (such as steric hindrance) or biochemical (change in ATP affinity) properties of the receptor and result in drug resistance (Gorre et al., 2001; Shah et al., 2002; Yun et al., 2008). We have previously described MET amplification as a mechanism of gefitinib resistance in EGFR mutant cancers (Engelman et al., 2007b), leading to persistent activation of both PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling in the presence of the EGFR TKI (Engelman et al., 2007b). A critical question for all resistance mechanisms to kinase inhibitors is whether they occur as a result of treatment or whether they pre-exist prior to treatment and are selected out during the course of therapy. At least some imatinib resistant CML clones are thought to be present at low levels prior to treatment and undergo clonal selection during imatinib exposure (Hofmann et al., 2003; Roche-Lestienne et al., 2003; Roche-Lestienne et al., 2002; Shah et al., 2002). Similarly, EGFR T790M can be detected at low levels in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients prior to gefitinib or erlotinib treatment (Maheswaran et al., 2008). Our current findings provide support that this may also be the case for MET amplification both in HCC827 cells (Figure S5B) and in NSCLC patients that subsequently develop MET amplification at the time of clinical gefitinib or erlotinib resistance (Figure 8). The identification of a drug resistance mechanism from a pre-treatment tumor specimen provides the opportunity to specifically target that resistance mechanism prior to its emergence. This approach is clinically appealing as combined treatment with an EGFR and MET inhibitor, specifically in patients with evidence of MET amplification at baseline, may lead to a longer time to progression than is currently observed with gefitinib or erlotinib alone (Asahina et al., 2006; Inoue et al., 2006; Mok et al., 2008; Paz-Ares et al., 2006; Sequist et al., 2008; Tamura et al., 2008). In fact, combined EGFR and MET inhibition in HCC827 cells extinguishes the emergence of MET amplified drug resistant clones (data not shown). However, it will be critical to learn whether upfront treatment with combination therapy is tolerable (toxicity) and/or will provide more clinical benefit than treatment at the time of relapse. Intriguingly, HCC827 cells appear to be pre-disposed to the development of low level MET amplification as subclones of cells expanded from single cell clones derived from parental HCC827 cells (HCC827 N1 and N2) also are found to contain low levels of MET amplification (Figure 7C). MET is located at a fragile site in chromosome 7, which facilitates its amplification, and subsequently a selection for clones harboring MET amplification can occur under drug pressure (Hellman et al., 2002). Why this occurs only in the HCC827 cells and a subset of lung cancers, and not in other EGFR mutant cell lines and cancers, is currently unknown. Collectively, these studies suggest, but do not prove that the specific mechanisms of resistance that will develop as a result of drug exposure may be pre-determined and occur as a result of drug selection. Understanding why some EGFR mutant cancers are pre-disposed to develop MET amplification will help further refine the clinical development of EGFR and MET inhibitor combinations. In this study, we also demonstrate two different and distinct roles for HGF in mediating EGFR TKI resistance. First, HGF can independently rescue both PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling in the presence of gefitinib and lead to drug resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Unlike in MET amplified resistant cancers, HGF mediated resistance occurs through GAB1, not ERBB3, signaling. Higher levels HGF can be detected in tumor specimens from NSCLC patients that are clinically resistant to gefitinib or erlotinib compared to pre-treatment tumor specimens (Figure 8A). Notably in some patients without evidence of EGFR T790M or MET amplification, HGF expression is greater in the resistant specimen (patients 1 (Figure S6C) and 14) than in the pre-treatment specimen, supporting a role for HGF alone in promoting drug resistance. This is consistent with prior observations (Yano et al., 2008). Ligand mediated drug resistance is unique to HGF as IGF does not rescue TKI-induced cell death in the majority of cell lines tested. Surprisingly, IGF did not restore P13K/AKT signaling in most EGFR mutant cancers, despite substantial levels of IGF-1R\u00a5\u00e2 expression and tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, unlike HGF, IGF did not restore ERK signaling even in cell lines in which it restored PI3K/AKT signaling in the presence of a TKI. These signaling differences between HGF and IGF may underlie the lack of drug resistance induced by IGF. In its second role, HGF accelerates the emergence of MET amplification in HCC827 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, this process requires concomitant EGFR inhibition, as HGF exposure alone does not lead to emergence of MET amplified clones. It is possible that in the presence of EGFR inhibition, HGF provides a unique proliferative advantage to a subset of cells with high MET expression (those with amplification) thus facilitating their rapid clonal expansion. Activation of MET signaling is a unique resistance mechanism to kinase inhibitors as it can occur through multiple independent mechanisms, amplification and/or ligand mediated, and when combined can lead to rapid evolution of drug resistance. Our current findings provide insight into future therapeutic strategies for the treatment of EGFR mutant NSCLC. Although MET amplification has been detected in up to 20% of EGFR mutant patients that develop acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib, activation of MET signaling (by both amplification and mediated by HGF) may in fact account for a larger fraction of gefitinib/erlotinib resistant tumors. It is tempting to speculate that HGF production by the stroma may also partially explain why clinical resistance emerges discordantly in some tissues like the liver, bone and brain, while pulmonary disease continues to respond to erlotinib treatment (personal observation). Our study further implies that the therapeutic combination of an irreversible EGFR inhibitor (effective against EGFR T790M) and a MET inhibitor is an attractive treatment combination for a significant portion of gefitinib/erlotinib resistant EGFR mutant NSCLC patients. In addition, these findings highlight the potential to prospectively identify treatment naive EGFR mutant lung cancer patients who are likely to develop MET amplification and may benefit from initial combination therapy with a MET inhibitor. Experimental Procedures. Cell culture reagents, viability studies and Western analyses. Cell lines and growth conditions are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Gefitinib and lapatinib were obtained from commercial sources (American Custom Chemical Corporation and LC Laboratories Woburn, MA). PF00299804, PHA-665,752 and PF2341066 were provided by Pfizer (La Jolla, CA). Cell viability was assessed 72 hours following drug exposure by Syto60 staining (Invitrogen) or by MTS assay (Promega). Cells were lysed in an NP-40 containing lysis buffer, separated by SDS/PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes. Immunoblotting was performed according to the antibody manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs recommendations. Antibody binding was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Generation of in vitro drug resistant HCC827 cells. To generate a resistant cell line, HCC827 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of PF00299804 similar to our previously described methods (Engelman et al., 2006; Engelman et al., 2007b). PF00299804 concentrations were increased stepwise from 1 nM to 1 \u00a5\u00ecM when the cells resumed growth kinetics similar to untreated parental cells. To confirm the emergence of a resistant clone, MTS assays were performed following growth at each concentration. In vivo treatment studies. All xenograft studies were performed in accordance with the standards of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under a protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital. Generation and treatment of xenograft models were performed as previously described and detailed in Supplementary Experimental Procedures (Engelman et al., 2007a). SNP analyses. SNP analyses to evaluate genome wide copy number changes were performed as previously described (Engelman et al., 2007b). Comparison of gene copy number between HCC827 and the PFR clones was performed using dChip software according to previously established methods (Engelman et al., 2007b; Zhao and Vogt, 2008). SNP data is available from the ncbi gene expression omnibus database (accession number: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE18797\",\"term_id\":\"18797\"}}GSE18797). FISH probes and hybridization. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones CTD-2257H21 (EGFR (7p11.2 )) and RP11-95I20 (MET (7q31.2)) were purchased from Children\u00a1\u00afs Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI; Oakland, CA). DNA was extracted using a Qiagen kit (Valencia, CA) and labeled with Spectrum Green- or Spectrum Orange-conjugated dUTP by nick translation (Vysis/Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL). The CEP7 probe (Vysis/Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, Il) was used according to manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Chromosomal mapping and hybridization efficiency for each probe set were verified in normal metaphase spreads (data not shown). Three color FISH assays were performed as previously described (Engelman et al., 2007b). High throughput fluorescence in situ hybridization. A Bioview work station with Duet\u00a2\u00e2 software (Bioview Ltd, Rehovot, Israel) was used to screen for rare MET amplified cells. Automatic scans were performed according to manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs suggested guidelines after setting classification criteria for each FISH probe. Images were captured and classified in an automated fashion and manually reviewed to ensure accuracy. Any unclassified images were manually reviewed and scored. Any cells that could not be scored were excluded from the analysis. Paraffin embedded specimens derived from NSCLC patients or from xenografts were manually scanned for evidence of MET amplification. NSCLC patients. Tumor specimens from gefitinib or erlotinib treated patients were obtained from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women\u00a1\u00afs Hospital (Boston, MA), Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA), the Chinese University (Hong Kong, China) and from Guangdong Provincial People\u00a1\u00afs Hospital (Guangzhou, China) under Institutional Review Board approved studies. All patients provided written informed consent. The presence of an EGFR mutation in each specimen was confirmed by exonspecific amplification (exons 18-21), followed by direct sequencing, or using the Surveyor\u00a2\u00e2 endonuclease coupled with denaturing HPLC (DHPLC), fractionation and sequencing (Janne et al., 2006). The EGFR T790M mutation was detected using Surveyor\u00a2\u00e2 endonuclease coupled with DHPLC or an allele specific PCR (Janne et al., 2006; Maheswaran et al., 2008). Both methods are capable of detecting the EGFR T790M mutation at an allele frequency of 1-5%. HGF immunohistochemistry was performed as using an anti-HGF 7.2 antibody kindly provided by Dr. George Vander Woude at the Van Andel Institute (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Highlights. Significance. The therapeutic success of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in EGFR mutant lung cancers is limited by the development of drug resistance, mediated by MET amplification in a subset of patients. Here we observe that MET amplification is present in a small fraction of cells prior to drug exposure and its emergence is dramatically accelerated by its ligand, HGF. These findings provide insight into the origins of drug resistance in EGFR mutant cancers, and support a rationale for combination treatment strategies as initial therapies, specifically in a molecularly defined cohort of patients with evidence of pre-existing MET amplification.

                "text": "Loss of Heterozygosity and DNA Methylation Affect Germline Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 Polymorphism to Direct Allelic Selection in Breast Cancer\tGenome-wide association studies highlight the importance of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor as a risk factor for breast cancer development. In particular, FGFR4 has been implicated in membrane ruffling, cancer cell invasiveness, and clinical chemoresistance in breast cancer. In this work, we studied FGFR4 in both human breast cancers and cell lines. We examined primary human microdissected breast samples for FGFR4 mutations, polymorphisms, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and DNA methylation status. We identified no activating somatic mutations of FGFR4; however, we did identify a high proportion of the FGFR4-R388 heterozygous germline polymorphism. Analysis of paired microdissected samples uncovered selective LOH at the FGFR4 locus in 50% of primary tumors. This LOH involved the FGFR4-WT allele as frequently as the cancer progression-associated FGFR4-G388R polymorphic allele. Further, we identified DNA methylation in one-third of cases that targeted the FGFR4-WT allele more often and occurred more frequently either in concert with or exclusively in lymph node metastases. The role of DNA methylation in silencing the FGFR4-WT allele was supported by azacytidine treatment findings and was also confirmed in mouse xenograft studies, demonstrating selective FGFR4-WT allelic methylation with corresponding gene down-regulation. These findings support a growth advantage function for FGFR4-R388 and underscore the complex role of DNA methylation and LOH in determining the penetrance of allelic selection in breast cancer progression. These findings therefore have critical therapeutic importance. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are implicated in cell differentiation and proliferation. They signal through FGFRs, transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases that are dysregulated in developmental and neoplastic conditions. Four FGFR genes encode a complex family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. 1 Each receptor is composed of three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like extracellular domains, two of which are involved in ligand binding, a transmembrane domain, a split tyrosine kinase, and a C-terminal tail with multiple autophosphorylation sites. 1 Multiple cell-bound or secreted isoforms of FGFR1, 2, and 3 are generated by alternative transcription initiation, alternative splicing, or exon switching. 2 Alternative splicing results in variants mainly within the third Ig-ligand binding domain. Variable polyadenylation yields secreted receptors. 3 Recent whole-genome-wide scans have identified intron two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FGFR2 gene as a locus associated with a small, but highly significant, increase in the risk of developing breast cancer. 4 , 5 Gene expression microarray data show increased FGFR2 expression in the rare homozygotes at these loci. In particular, two cis-regulatory SNPs within intron 2 alter binding affinity for transcription factors Oct-1/Runx2 and C/EBP\u00a5\u00e2 to enhance FGFR2-IIIb expression. 6 However, FGFR family members are also known to form heterodimers, 7 emphasizing the importance of a more detailed understanding of their involvement in breast cancer development and progression. FGFR4 displays the most restricted pattern of expression compared with other FGFRs. Expression levels decline postnatally but have been reported to increase in solid tumors including breast and colorectal carcinomas. 8 , 9 , 10 Further, the FGFR4 genomic structure has 18 instead of the 19 exons of the other FGFRs, 11 and thus it lacks the alternative exons that encode the third Ig-like domain variants. Human intestinal epithelial cells express an FGFR4 transcript where exon 9 is displaced by intron 9, leading to loss of the transmembrane domain. 12 Alternative splicing of intron 17 in the mouse leads to a truncated FGFR4 with a shorter intracellular tail. 13 We reported a pituitary tumor-derived N-terminally truncated receptor that has cytoplasmic residence 14 and alters FGFR4 interactions with adhesion molecules, resulting in dysadhesion, 15 and a C-terminally truncated variant in breast cancer cells. 16 Although FGFR4 was considered to be weakly mitogenic, it increases DNA synthesis as effectively as FGFR1. 17 , 18 FGFR4 has been implicated in membrane ruffling in breast cancer cells 19 , 20 and resistance to chemotherapy. 21 In this report we use primary and clonal breast carcinomas to examine mechanisms involved in the regulation of FGFR4 and its major SNP. The data suggest a complex interaction between epigenetic and genetic events in governing FGFR4 SNP allelic penetrance during breast cancer progression. Materials and Methods. Primary Human Breast Tumor Specimens. Primary human breast tissues were obtained at the time of surgery from 36 patients. The first set consisted of 21 patients with invasive ductal carcinomas and no known metastasis at the time of diagnosis (Table 1). Nearly two-thirds (62%) of this group were estrogen receptor (ER)-positive carcinomas. A second set of 15 patients presented with carcinomas and lymph node metastases (Table 1). Samples were obtained following informed consent and institutional ethics review. Fresh tissue was snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen and corresponding tissue was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. For isolation of normal and tumor epithelial cells, hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were microdissected under an inverted microscope using a 26-gauge needle. Microdissected tissue was digested for nucleic acid extraction as previously described. 22 Genotyping. Genomic DNA was isolated using standard methods of proteinase K digestion and phenol-chloroform extraction. The FGFR4 mutations and polymorphisms (Figure 1, A and B) were amplified by PCR using primers as listed in Table 2. PCR products were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) for automated sequencing or BstN1 digestion. Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH). Two microsatellite markers, D5S2111 and D5S469, were selected for their closest proximity to the FGFR4 locus. The 5\u00a1\u00c7 PCR primers were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein. PCR was carried out for 10 minutes at 95\u00a1\u00c6C followed by 35 cycles of 30 seconds at 95\u00a1\u00c6C, 30 seconds at Tm, and 30 seconds at 72\u00a1\u00c6C, followed by a 10 minutes of extension at 72\u00a1\u00c6C, in a reaction mixture containing 1.5 mmol/L MgCl 2, 0.2 mmol/L dNTP, 0.2 mmol/L each primer, and 0.25 U/10 \u00a5\u00ecl of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR products were electrophoresed according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions for the ABI Prism 377 system (Applied Biosystems), and the data were analyzed using GeneScan analysis software version 2.1 (Applied Biosystems) as described previously. 22 DNA Methylation. DNA methylation was examined by combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) as described previously. 23 For the FGFR4 promoter region we took advantage of BstU1 digestion sites surrounding the transcription start site. Restriction digestion products were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels, followed by UV exposure. Experiments were performed on three independent occasions. RNA Extraction and Analyses. Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences) and from tissues using RecoverALL (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) respectively, according to the manufacturers\u00a1\u00af instructions. Approximately 1.0 \u00a5\u00ecg of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed in a 20-\u00a5\u00ecl volume using the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ). RT-PCR primers were designed to span exons of human FGFR4 (Table 2). PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium staining. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed as previously described. 22 Western Blotting. Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml PMSF, aprotinin, and sodium orthovanadate in PBS). Total cell lysates were quantified by the Bio-Rad method. Fifty micrograms of whole lysates were separated on 10% SDS denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nylon membranes (Millipore, MA). Blots were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody which selectively recognizes the C-terminal fragment of FGFR4 (Santa Cruz) at 1:1000 dilution in PBS-5% nonfat milk with 0.1% Tween at 4\u00a1\u00c6C overnight, followed by washing with PBS-Tween 20 four times of 10 minutes each at room temperature, then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (1:2000) for 1 hour at room temperature with agitation. Protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence (Amersham, Oakville, ON, Canada). Experiments were performed on two independent occasions. Immunocytochemistry. Primary breast tissue FGFR4 protein expression was examined by immunocytochemistry on 4-\u00a5\u00ecm sections of tissue. Briefly, sections were treated with 2% hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxide for 30 minutes and exposed to 5 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml proteinase K for 15 minutes at room temperature. The sections were washed extensively and exposed to equilibration buffer for 10 minutes. Each slide was then incubated with anti-FGFR4 antibody (polyclonal antibody; Santa Cruz) overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C overnight. The reaction was visualized with the avidin-biotin method and 3,3\u00a1\u00c7-diaminobenzidine. Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines, Treatment, and Xenografting. Human breast cancer cell lines examined included the ER\u00a5\u00e1-positive MCF-7 cells and the ER\u00a5\u00e1-negative MDA-231 and MDA-453, and MDA-468 breast cancer cell lines. For assessment of DNA methylation, cells were treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2\u00a1\u00c7-deoxycytidine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) freshly prepared at concentrations of 5 or 10 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L for 5 days as described previously. 23 For growth in vivo, 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 breast carcinoma cells were injected subcutaneously in 6-week-old female SCID mice for 6 to 7 weeks as described previously. 24 , 25 Excised tissue was extracted for analyses from three animals per group as indicated. Statistical Analysis. Continuous data are presented as mean \u00a1\u00be SE, while binomial variables are presented as absolute numbers and percent frequency. Results were analyzed using nonparametric statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U-test when appropriate for comparison of median values of two independent groups. Statistical significance was considered reached at two-tailed P < 0.05. Results. FGFR4 Mutational Analyses in Primary Breast Carcinomas. Activating mutations in FGFR4 are relatively infrequent in solid tumors. 26 We did not identify the presence of activating mutations including the recently described N535K and V550L (Figure 1, A and B) associated with rhabdomyoscarcomas. 27 We also did not detect the Y367C substitution in the extracellular juxtamembrane region as recently described in the MDA-453 human breast cancer cell line 28 in the primary normal tissues, tumors, and metastatic samples examined (Table 1). Instead, DNA sequencing of normal breast epithelium identified the common occurrence of a previously described transmembrane polymorphism substituting a glycine (G) with an arginine (R) in codon 388 (Figure 1, A and B). Half of patients (19/36 or 53%) displayed a heterozygous (G/R) pattern for this allele in their normal tissue (Table 1). Interestingly, nearly half of these patients revealed evidence of only a single FGFR4 allele in their tumors (Figure 1C; Table 1) suggesting possible LOH at this gene locus. Further, nearly half of ER-positive patients (11/24) proved to be FGFR4-WT in contrast to the ER-negative patients, the majority (11/12; 92%) of whom carried an FGFR4 variant (G388R) allele (Table 1). FGFR4 Is Differentially Regulated in Human Neoplastic Breast Tissue. To identify evidence for selective deregulated FGFR4 gene expression in breast cancer, we compared FGFR4 immunostaining in primary human breast epithelium with that in paired neoplastic tissue (Figure 2A). This examination revealed variable FGFR4 staining in tumorous epithelial cells which was reduced in 22 of 36 tumors (61%) compared with normal adjacent tissue (Figure 2A; Table 1). To determine the mechanisms underlying altered FGFR4 expression, we performed detailed microdissection to obtain normal breast epithelium, primary breast carcinoma tissue, or lymph node metastases (Figure 2B). These microdissected samples were used for all subsequent analyses. The FGFR4 Locus Is Subject to Loss of Heterozygosity. The differences noted in FGFR4 polymorphic sequencing and protein staining in neoplastic compared to normal tissue prompted us to examine putative mechanisms for variable gene expression. Further, given that some earlier studies suggested a tumor suppressive role for wild-type FGFR4 (FGFR4-WT), 29 we specifically examined the potential for LOH at the FGFR4 locus using two markers as shown in Figure 3A. Comparing paired DNA from normal and tumor cells, we identified evidence of LOH in tumor cells in 50% (17/34) of informative patients (Figure 3B). Of these, LOH involved the FGFR4-R388 allele as frequently as the FGFR4-WT allele (8/17 versus 9/17, respectively). LOH with loss of the FGFR4-WT allele was also noted exclusively in two metastatic tissues without corresponding loss in the primary tumor (Table 1). DNA Methylation Contributes to FGFR4 Down-Regulation in Breast Cancer Progression. We next examined DNA methylation as an alternate mechanism for gene down-regulation. We used COBRA to detect and quantify the degree of methylation (Figure 4A). This approach identified the presence of DNA methylation in 12/36 (33%) patients (Figure 4B; Table 1). The presence of DNA methylation was exclusive to neoplastic samples and it was not detectable in paired normal tissue (Table 1). Absence of DNA methylation was significantly more frequent in ER-positive than ER-negative tumors (22 versus 6; P = 0.022). Further, DNA methylation was twice as likely to silence the FGFR4-WT allele versus the FGFR4 SNP (Figure 4B, samples 19, 17, 3, and 20) (P = 0.09). In addition, two metastatic samples showed exclusive methylation of the wild-type FGFR4 allele without similar methylation in the primary tumor (Figure 4B; samples 34 and 24). A summary of FGFR4 expression, LOH, and methylation findings in the different tissues is shown in Figure 4C. As DNA methylation of the FGFR4 5\u00a1\u00c7 region had not been previously described we elected to confirm the role of this mechanism in gene regulation using clonal breast carcinoma cell lines. Figure 5A depicts a panel of breast carcinoma cell lines based on their FGFR4 expression. Analogous to the primary breast carcinomas, MCF-7 cells showed evidence of 5\u00a1\u00c7 DNA methylation (Figure 5B). Consistent with this finding, pharmacological DNA methylation inhibition with 5\u00a1\u00c7-azacytidine resulted in FGFR4 up-regulation in MCF-7 (Figure 5C) but not in MDA-231 or MDA-453 cells, which showed no evidence of gene methylation (Figure 5D). To further examine the involvement of FGFR4 methylation in the context of the codon 388 SNP and cancer progression, we xenografted MDA-231 and MDA-468 cells, both of which are wild-type (FGFR4-WT), and MDA-453 cells, which are polymorphic (FGFR4-G388R), at this codon. A measurable degree of FGFR4 DNA methylation (Figure 6A) with reduced mRNA and protein expression (Figure 6, B and C) was evident following xenografting of the FGFR4-WT (MDA-231 and MDA-468 cells) but not the polymorphic MDA-453 cells. Discussion. FGFRs are often mis-expressed in solid tumors, being detected in several alternatively spliced isoforms. 30 The role of FGFR4 in cancer, however, continues to be enigmatic with conflicting data. Unlike other FGFRs, this receptor lacks the alternative exons that encode the extracellular ligand binding domain variants. Furthermore, activating mutations in FGFR4 appear to be infrequent in solid tumors including breast carcinomas. 26 FGFR4 expression was originally noted to be amplified in nearly 10% of primary breast carcinomas. 8 Although considered to be weakly mitogenic, FGFR4 increases DNA synthesis as effectively as FGFR1. 17 , 18 FGFR4 has also been implicated in membrane ruffling in breast cancer cells 19 where expression has been reported to be abundant. 20 Crosstalk between FGFR-4 and ErbB2 via the MAPK and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been suggested to contribute to the maintenance of constitutive activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin translational pathway. 31 More recently, a somatic mutation in the extracellular ligand binding domain (Y367C) mutation was described in MDA-453 breast cancer cells. This mutation contributes to ligand independence with constitutive Erk1/2 activation. 28 We did not detect this mutation in our primary breast carcinoma samples. Similarly, two additional activating mutations in the FGFR4 kinase domain N535K and V550L (Figure 1) were recently reported in primary rhabdomyosarcomas. 27 We could not identify either of these mutations in our series of primary breast carcinomas or their metastases. Thus, unlike other FGFRs, FGFR4 intragenic mutations appear to be relatively rare somatic events in solid tumors. 26 One of the most common inherited genetic variations associated with cancer is the SNP. The FGFR4-R388 germline allele is present in nearly 5% of the population and has been linked with several carcinomas including head and neck squamous carcinomas, 32 aggressive breast cancer progression, 33 and correlated with treatment resistance. 21 Other reports, however, suggested that this polymorphism was not associated with cancer risk 34 , 35 or with prognosis. 36 The data shown here provide one line of evidence which might explain some of the earlier cited discrepancies. While we identified the frequent presence of the FGFR4-G388R polymorphism in patients with breast carcinomas, we also show for the first time that the FGFR4 locus is subject to genetic and epigenetic alterations during disease progression. Our loss-of-heterozygosity studies used multiple markers situated on the long arm of chromosome 5. This region contains genes encoding several receptors which include FGFR4, PDGF-R, and fms-related kinase-4 (FLT4). Deletions of the 5q region have long been recognized most typically in association with myelodysplastic syndromes. 37 More recently, the 5q deletion-associated hematopoietic phenotypes were mapped to the ribosomal subunit protein RPS14 gene. 38 Our current studies, however, used more telomeric markers situated most closely to 5q35-qter, wherein FGFR4 is localized. 39 To our knowledge, this more restricted region has not been previously examined in breast carcinomas and particularly in the context of the FGFR4-G388R polymorphism. 40 The human FGFR4 promoter region encompassing the 5\u00a1\u00c7 untranslated region and exon 1 contains a large CpG island. Using COBRA examination of the associated CpG island of microdissected samples we found DNA methylation to be more frequent in neoplastic tissue compared to corresponding normal tissue. Of further interest, methylation of the wild-type allele was noted in metastatic lesions, consistent with the demonstrated tumor suppressive role of this allele. 29 In contrast, retention of the FGFR4-R388 allele in neoplastic tissue is consistent with the tumor progressive actions of this mutant allele as recently described in mouse knockin studies. 41 The recent genome-wide association findings have highlighted FGFR2 as an important candidate gene linked with increased breast cancer risk. 4 , 5 These studies identified the minor disease-predisposing allele of FGFR2 to be inherited as a region within intron 2 harboring multiple SNPs. In particular, four of the eight recognized intron 2 polymorphisms associated with increased breast cancer risk have been putatively linked with enhanced FGFR2 expression. 42 , 43 It has been proposed that these sites include transcription-binding regions that can potentially drive endogenous gene expression. Nevertheless, we showed that DNA methylation can contribute to FGFR2 down-regulation in primary breast carcinomas. When comparing paired normal and neoplastic microdissected tissue, FGFR2 was down-regulated despite intron 2 polymorphisms. Thus, the current findings extend these observations to underscore the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in governing common genetic polymorphisms including those encoding the FGFR4 polymorphism. The mechanisms by which FGFR4 can be implicated in breast cancer progression remain unclear. The initial description of the FGFR4 codon 388 SNP identified a growth inhibitory effect associated with the FGFR4-WT allele. 29 Consistent with these observations, FGFR4-WT was noted to impede Akt activation and breast cancer cell motility. 29 The isolation of a C-terminally truncated FGFR4 isoform from MCF-7 cells 16 represented another line of evidence supporting a dominant negative role for breast cancer-derived FGFR4 variants. The more frequent association of FGFR4-WT with ER positivity raises the possibility that signaling of these systems may have a reinforcing effect. Alternatively, the mutant FGFR4 allele may contribute to loss of ER. Further, our current data demonstrating LOH and DNA methylation of the FGFR4-WT allele in primary microdissected breast carcinomas provides strong support for the putative tumor suppressive role of the prototypic form of the receptor. The extent to which FGFR4-R388 functions as an independent oncogene has been suggested from knockin studies. In the FGFR4-G385R knockin mouse model, the SNP served to promote transforming growth factor-\u00a5\u00e1-mediated breast cancer progression. 41 In summary, our data support the common occurrence of the FGFR4 codon 388 transmembrane SNP in primary breast carcinomas. However, we also identified nearly equal contributions from LOH and DNA methylation in influencing FGFR4 gene expression. Given the distinct functions of the wild-type versus polymorphic receptor isoforms, the regulatory forces imposing on FGFR4 allelic selection will have to be accounted for in understanding this receptor\u00a1\u00afs role in cancer progression. Such influences will also have to be considered in personalized targeted therapeutics of FGFR4 in breast cancer. Acknowledgments. We thank Kelvin So for technical assistance. Footnotes.

                "text": "Gene therapy-mediated delivery of targeted cytotoxins for glioma therapeutics\tRestricting the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents by targeting receptors exclusively expressed on tumor cells is critical when treating infiltrative brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBMs express an IL-13 receptor (IL13R\u00a5\u00e12) that differs from the physiological IL4R/IL13R receptor. We developed a regulatable adenoviral vector (Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE) encoding a mutated human IL-13 fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin (mhIL-13-PE) that specifically binds to IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 to provide sustained expression, effective anti-GBM cytotoxicity, and minimal neurotoxicity. The therapeutic Ad also encodes mutated human IL-4 that binds to the physiological IL4R/IL13R without interacting with IL13R\u00a5\u00e12, thus inhibiting potential binding of mhIL-13-PE to normal brain cells. Using intracranial GBM xenografts and syngeneic mouse models, we tested the Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE and two protein formulations, hIL-13-PE used in clinical trials (Cintredekin Besudotox) and a second-generation mhIL-13-PE. Cintredekin Besudotox doubled median survival without eliciting long-term survival and caused severe neurotoxicity; mhIL-13-PE led to \u00a1\u00ad40% long-term survival, eliciting severe neurological toxicity at the high dose tested. In contrast, Ad-mediated delivery of mhIL-13-PE led to tumor regression and long-term survival in over 70% of the animals, without causing apparent neurotoxicity. Although Cintredekin Besudotox was originally developed to target GBM, when tested in a phase III trial it failed to achieve clinical endpoints and revealed neurotoxicity. Limitations of Cintredekin Besudotox include its short half-life, which demanded frequent or continued administration, and binding to IL4R/IL13R, present in normal brain cells. These shortcomings were overcome by our therapeutic Ad, thus representing a significant advance in the development of targeted therapeutics for GBM. Intense research efforts have aimed to restrict the cytotoxic effect of anticancer agents by targeting cellular receptors exclusively overexpressed on tumor cells (1?5). This specificity is particularly required when designing therapies for brain tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), in which tumor cells infiltrate the normal brain. GBM is the most common primary brain cancer in adults, and carries a dismal prognosis (14- to 21-mo median survival), in spite of an advanced standard of care, namely surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide (6?8). Targeting of cytotoxic proteins to receptors exclusively expressed on GBMs would allow selective killing of glioma cells diffusely infiltrating throughout the normal brain. Fifty to 80% of human GBMs express a variant of the IL-13 receptor, IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 (9?12), that differs from its physiological counterpart IL4R/IL13R, expressed in normal tissues (13). Because IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 is virtually absent from normal brain cells (14), human IL-13 was fused to a truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin (hIL-13-PE; Cintredekin Besudotox) to target IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing GBM cells (15). Due to the short half-life of the hIL-13-PE protein formulation (16, 17), multiple injections or continued delivery was necessary to achieve therapeutic levels (1, 16, 18). This approach was tested preclinically and in phase I?III clinical trials (16?18). However, in spite of high expectations, the phase III trial failed to achieve clinical endpoints (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/node/4883). Clinical trials of GBM with hIL-13-PE reported adverse events in all patients, most of which (60%) were neurological (18). Grade III or IV adverse events were observed at the dose-limiting toxicity of 1 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL (18). Neurotoxicity could be related to hIL-13-PE binding to the physiological IL4R/IL13R expressed in the normal brain (19, 20). To overcome the above limitations, we developed a regulatable gene therapy strategy to express highly cytotoxic proteins in the brain tumor microenvironment, aiming to elicit tumor regression and long-term survival. To restrict the targeted toxin exclusively to IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 +-glioma cells, a mutated form of IL-13 was engineered [IL-13.E13K, or mhIL-13 (21)], which was previously shown to bind to the GBM-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 with higher affinity than the native hIL-13, exhibiting negligible binding to the physiological receptor IL4R/IL13R (21, 22). We hypothesized that a regulatable adenoviral vector (Ad) encoding mhIL-13 fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin would provide long-term local expression leading to an effective cytotoxic response in IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing GBM cells, with minimal neurotoxicity toward the normal surrounding brain parenchyma. To further increase safety, the vector encodes mutated human IL-4 [mhIL-4, or IL-4.Y124D (21, 22)] that binds and blocks the physiological receptor IL4R/IL13R without interacting with IL13R\u00a5\u00e12, thereby inhibiting any potential binding of mhIL-13-PE to normal brain cells and subsequent neurotoxicity. Results.  Construction, Rescue, and Purification of Adenoviral Vectors Encoding Mutated Human IL-13 Fused to Pseudomonas Exotoxin.. To achieve sustained expression of GBM-specific mhIL-13-PE within the tumor microenvironment, we constructed a regulatable, bidirectional Ad expressing the mhIL-13-PE cytotoxin under the control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter system. This vector also expresses a mutated form of human IL-4, IL4.Y124D (mhIL-4), which blocks the putative binding of mhIL-13-PE to the physiological IL4R/IL13R without affecting its binding to the glioma-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 (21, 22). We also constructed a control vector expressing mhIL-4 and mhIL-13 (without the PE) under the control of the tetracycline-responsive (TRE) promoter. The TetON system that regulates the activity of the bidirectional TRE promoter consists of the tetracycline-controlled transactivator rtTA2S-M2, which activates the TRE promoter in the presence of the inducer doxycycline (Dox), and the Tet repressor tTS kid, which inhibits expression in the absence of Dox, inhibiting the leakiness of the system (23, 24). The mCMV promoter drives constitutive expression of TetON. The diagram in Fig. 1A depicts the regulation of transgene expression from the therapeutic Ad. SI Appendix, Table 1 summarizes the description and denomination of all Ads and protein formulations used.  Bioactivity and Specificity of Therapeutic Transgenes in Vitro and in Vivo.. Adenoviral-mediated therapeutic transgene expression and GBM-specific cytotoxicity were successfully regulated in vitro by the Tet-dependent system. In the presence of Dox (ON state), Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE led to a reduction in cell viability of >70% in IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 + human GBM cells (IN859 and U251), whereas it did not affect the viability of control COS-7 cells, which do not express IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 (Fig. 1B), highlighting the specificity of the cytotoxic effect. Expression of mhIL-13 and PE was detected in U251 GBM cells only in the \u00a1\u00b0ON\u00a1\u00b1 state (SI Appendix, Fig. 1A). Release of mhIL-4 from control COS-7 cells infected with control or therapeutic Ads was also observed only in the ON state and was completely turned off in the absence of the inducer (SI Appendix, Fig. 1B), indicating that transgene expression mediated by the TRE promoter is tightly regulated. One of the main drawbacks of the cytotoxin protein formulation is its short half-life, and thus we assessed whether Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE would lead to sustained therapeutic transgene expression in vivo. We tested the expression of Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE 7 d after injection into the naive mouse brain. Expression of mhIL-13, assessed by immunocytochemistry, was readily detected in the brain injected with either control or therapeutic Ads (SI Appendix, Fig. 2). Fig. 1C shows colocalization of mhIL-13 and PE 7 d after injection with Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE, indicating the robustness of this system to achieve sustained expression of the cytotoxin in the ON state.  Efficacy and Neurotoxicity of Therapeutic Ad Versus Protein Formulations in Intracranial Human GBM Xenografts in Nude Mice.. Targeted toxins are delivered into the brain parenchyma surrounding the tumor after surgical resection of the main tumor mass, and hence it is crucial that these agents induce specific killing of GBM cells infiltrating the nonneoplastic brain without eliciting toxicity to normal brain cells. Thus, the cytotoxicity of Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE and the protein formulation hIL-13-PE (Cintredekin Besudotox) that consists of the native human IL-13 fused to PE or the second-generation mhIL-13-PE that consists of the mhIL-13, that is, IL-13.E13K fused to PE, was assessed in human GBM cells and in primary cultures of human neural progenitor cell (NPC)-derived astrocytes and neurons. Whereas in human GBM cells (Fig. 2A) Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE and both protein formulations exhibited a powerful cytotoxic effect, none of the three treatments induced substantial cytotoxicity in cultures of human NPC-derived astrocytes and neurons (Fig. 2B), indicating that, in vitro, the cytotoxic effect of all these targeted cytotoxins is specific for GBM cells. We then compared the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of the protein formulation of the cytotoxins and the Ad-mediated gene delivery approach in an intracranial human GBM xenograft model. To this end, we implanted U251 human GBM cells in the striatum of nude mice (SI Appendix, Fig. 3) and treated them 5 d later with a single intratumoral injection of Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE or, as control, Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13, saline, or an empty Ad (Ad.0) (Fig. 3A). Whereas all mice treated with saline, Ad.0, or control Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13 succumbed due to tumor burden (median survival: 28, 43, and 47 d, respectively), \u00a1\u00ad70% of the mice treated with the therapeutic Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE survived long-term, over 100 d (Fig. 3B). To test the neurotoxicity of this gene therapeutic approach in the naive mouse brain of immune-competent animals, we injected Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE or, as controls, Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13, saline, or Ad.0 in the striatum of wild-type BALB/c mice. Seven days later, brain architecture was evaluated by Nissl staining and immunocytochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), as an index of striatal tissue integrity, and myelin basic protein (MBP), as an index of oligodendrocyte integrity. We found that Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE did not induce overt toxicity or local or systemic adverse side effects. The structure of the brain was preserved and there was no apparent reduction in TH expression, demyelinization (Fig. 3C), or overt inflammation (SI Appendix, Fig. 4). When U251 GBM-bearing mice were treated with either 0.2 or 1 \u00a5\u00ecg of native hIL-13-PE protein formulation, their median survival doubled (saline: 22 d; 0.2 \u00a5\u00ecg: 53 d; 1 \u00a5\u00ecg: 55 d; P < 0.05), but all of the animals succumbed to tumor burden by day 56 (Fig. 4A). Mice treated with the high dose of the second-generation mhIL-13-PE performed better, exhibiting a long-term survival rate of \u00a1\u00ad40% (Fig. 4C). However, some of the mice treated with the high dose of hIL-13-PE or mhIL-13-PE had to be euthanized shortly after the treatment due to neurological deficits (Fig. 4 A and C). We then evaluated the neuropathology of these proteins in naive immune-competent BALB/c mice injected in the brain with 0.2 or 1 \u00a5\u00ecg of Cintredekin Besudotox (hIL-13-PE) (Fig. 4B) or mhIL-13-PE (Fig. 4D). Administration of Cintredekin Besudotox at either 0.2 or 1 \u00a5\u00ecg was very toxic to the normal brain, leading to severe neurological side effects, loss of brain tissue (Fig. 4B), and severe neurological deficits that required euthanasia of all of the mice 3 d after injection. Although the same outcome was found when injecting 1 \u00a5\u00ecg of mhIL-13-PE in the naive brain, mice that received the lower dose of mhIL-13-PE (0.2 \u00a5\u00ecg) did not show signs of overt toxicity in the brain nor displayed neurological signs (Fig. 4D).  Efficacy and Neurotoxicity of Therapeutic Ads in Intracranial Human Primary GBM Xenografts and Syngeneic Murine GBM in Immune-Competent Mice.. Considering the limitations of human GBM xenografts derived from cell lines, namely the loss of certain features present in human GBMs due to prolonged in vitro passage, we tested the efficacy of the therapeutic Ad in an intracranial human primary GBM12 tumor, which is a transplantable human tumor that retains the biological and histological properties of the original human GBM specimen (25, 26), including epidermal growth factor receptor amplification (26), TP53 mutation (26), and expression of IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 (25). We implanted GBM12 cells from short-term cultures in the brain of Rag1 ?/? mice and treated them 5 d later with the therapeutic and control vectors or, as controls, saline or an empty Ad (Ad.0). The therapeutic vector, Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE, led to tumor regression and long-term survival in \u00a1\u00ad30% of the mice and increased the median survival from 20 d in control mice to 63 d (Fig. 5A). The neuropathological analysis of the brains from long-term survivors (120 d) showed complete tumor regression and did not reveal signs of neurotoxicity (Fig. 5C). In addition, because human GBM xenograft models do not replicate the clinical scenario in which the vectors are delivered in the setting of an immune-competent system, we tested the efficacy of our therapeutic vector in immune-competent mice bearing intracranial syngeneic gliomas that express IL13R\u00a5\u00e12. GL26 GBM cells stably transfected to express IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 (27) were implanted in the brain of syngeneic immune-competent C57/B6 mice. Seven days later, mice were treated by intratumoral injection of the therapeutic and control Ads or, as controls, saline or an empty Ad (Ad.0). We found that Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE exerted a robust antitumoral effect, leading to over 50% survival for over 4 mo (Fig. 5B). The neuropathological analysis of long-term survivors did not reveal signs of neurotoxicity or overt inflammation and confirmed complete regression of the tumor (Fig. 5D; SI Appendix, Fig. 5). These results show that the efficacy of our therapeutic vector would not be curtailed in the context of a competent immune system. Discussion. Although the development of chimeric cytotoxins targeting the IL-13 receptor in human GBM created high expectations in the past few years, their performance in clinical trials has led to modest results, with the main drawbacks being the low specificity of the toxin used, Cintredekin Besudotox, that led to dose-limiting toxicity, and the short half-life of the protein formulation, which required frequent and prolonged administrations. To overcome these limitations, we developed a therapeutic Ad that expresses mhIL-13-PE under the control of a regulatable promoter and assessed its efficacy and safety profile comparing it with Cintredekin Besudotox and with the second-generation cytotoxin protein formulation mhIL-13-PE. Our results show that a single intratumoral injection of Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE leads to a powerful antitumor effect in vivo, yielding a survival rate of over 70%. On the other hand, a single intratumoral administration of the protein formulations led to lower antitumor efficacy; that is, Cintredekin Besudotox doubled the median survival and all of the animals succumbed to tumor burden, and the second-generation mhIL-13-PE protein formulation elicited \u00a1\u00ad40% long-term survival. These results suggest that the short half-life of the protein formulations (16, 17) can be overcome by Ads, which allow sustained local expression. Clinical trials in GBM patients showed that intracranial administration of hIL-13-PE led to dose-limiting toxicity, including neurological symptoms secondary to necrotic and inflammatory processes as well as irreversible hemiparesis and the death of one patient due to neurologic decline potentially related to hIL-13-PE; these adverse side effects could be due to binding of the cytotoxin to normal brain cells which can express the physiological IL4R/IL13R (18). Further, grade III and IV imaging changes suggesting tissue damage were observed in tumor-infiltrated and normal brain parenchyma (28) and regarded as nonspecific internalization of hIL-13-PE (18). In view of these previous reports, we assessed the neurotoxicity of our therapeutic vector and performed a comparison with two cytotoxin protein formulations. Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE did not induce overt cytotoxicity in normal human brain cells in vitro nor in the normal mouse brain in vivo, suggesting that the expression of the therapeutic transgenes encoded in this vector platform would not be toxic to normal brain tissue. On the other hand, although both protein formulations were not toxic in vitro in human astrocytes and neurons, their administration into the naive mouse brain led to very severe neurological side effects. Although Cintredekin Besudotox exhibited neurological toxicity at low and high doses, the neurotoxicity of the second-generation mhIL-13-PE protein formulation was dose-dependent, with no neuropathological abnormalities at the low, 0.2-\u00a5\u00ecg dose, supporting the notion that this toxin is more specific toward GBM and safer than Cintredekin Besudotox. These findings also highlight the crucial importance of testing neurotoxicity in vivo rather than limiting its assessment to in vitro cell-culture systems. This could be related to the fact that primary cultures of human brain cells were obtained from fetal brains, in which neurons and glial cells are still developing and may not represent closely the normal adult brain. Our results show that a bidirectional Tet-dependent promoter can be used to successfully drive the expression of two therapeutic transgenes in a tumor model in vivo. Considering the limitations of using U251 human glioma xenografts, namely the loss of certain biological features due to continuous in vitro passage and the fact that it does not replicate the clinical scenario in which the vectors are delivered in the setting of an immune-competent system, we demonstrated the efficacy of our therapeutic vector in two additional orthotopic GBM models: human primary GBM12 xenografts and syngeneic GL26-H2 GBM in immune-competent mice. These results show that our therapeutic vector exerts a robust antitumoral effect, which would not be curtailed in the context of an immune-competent system. In summary, the advantages of our therapy approach for GBM are as follows. First, a single intratumoral injection of this vector provides a powerful antitumor effect with negligible neurotoxicity, which constituted a serious limitation of the protein formulation hIL-13-PE, Cintredekin Besudotox, used in clinical trials. Another advantage of our vector is that the expression of the therapeutic transgenes is controlled by an inducible promoter that allows expression to be easily regulated by switching \u00a1\u00b0off\u00a1\u00b1 transcription, through withdrawal of the inducer doxycycline. Also, expression of mhIL-4 inhibits binding of mhIL-13-PE to normal cells, which constitutes an additional safety feature of our approach. Our results highlight the suitability of Ads to deliver cytotoxins into the tumor microenvironment without the need of frequent readministration to elicit therapeutic efficacy. The major safety features of Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE over hIL-13-PE are displayed in the diagram shown in Fig. 6. In conclusion, we demonstrate the clinically relevant in vivo and in vitro safety profile and efficacy of a regulatable, bicistronic adenoviral vector expressing mhIL-13 fused to PE (to specifically target glioma cells), together with mhIL-4, to further inhibit any potential binding of the targeted toxin to normal brain cells. These results indicate that the development of Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE constitutes a significant advance in the implementation of targeted toxins for glioma therapeutics. Materials and Methods.

                "text": "PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 Inhibitors That Inhibit Metastasis\tPrevious genetic analyses have suggested that mutations of the genes encoding PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 facilitate invasion and metastasis but have less effect on primary tumor growth. These findings have major implications for therapeutics but have not been factored into pre-clinical drug development designs. Here we show that the inhibition of PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 by newly designed small molecule inhibitors prevented metastasis formation in mice but had much less effect on the growth of subcutaneous xenografts or primary intra-abdominal tumors. These data support the idea that PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 plays an important role in the metastatic process and suggest a more informed strategy for selecting drugs worthy of further development for clinical application. INTRODUCTION. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K) class 1A family is a critical regulator of growth, motility and survival functions [1]. PI3K class 1A members transmit signals from a variety of growth factor receptors, creating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as activator and membrane docking station for PDK1 and Akt proteins, thereby initiating a kinase cascade that connects the cell membrane receptors with nuclear transcription factors. In light of its central role in numerous cellular processes, the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is tightly regulated, with PTEN reversing the phosphorylation of PIP2 catalyzed by PI3K Class 1A family members. The alpha isoform of PI3K (PI3K\u00a5\u00e1) is one of the most frequently mutated kinases in solid tumors [2, 3]. Structural insights from the study of normal and mutated forms of PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 suggest a release of inhibition by its regulating subunit p85 as well as altered membrane binding as causes for the observed biochemical over activity of the mutants [4-8]. The mutational activation of PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 permits cell survival in culture when growth factors are limiting [6, 8]. PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 is a heterodimer of a catalytic subunit encoded by PIK3CA and one of several regulatory subunits [9]. The high frequency of PIK3CA mutations in human tumors, the localization of mutations to particular \u00a1\u00b0hotspot\u00a1\u00b1 regions, and the enhanced enzymatic activity of the mutant gene's products have made PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 a preferred target for drug development. Indeed, PI3KCA is one of the two most highly mutated oncogenes ever discovered (the other being KRAS). For these reasons, many academic and industrial groups are attempting to develop inhibitors of this enzyme [10-21]. There are currently nine PI3K inhibitors in clinical trials, none of which are particularly specific for PI3K\u00a5\u00e1. These inhibitors can be classified into six core structures. PX-866 and SF1126 are analogues of wortmannin and LY294002, respectively, with improved pharmacokinetic properties [13, 22]. NVP-BEZ235, PF-04691502, BGT226 and XL765 are novel compounds with a broader and more potent inhibition profile that target PI3Ks as well as mTOR [23-25]. GDC-0941, XL147 and NVP-BKM120 are potent pan PI3K class 1A inhibitors lacking mTOR inhibition [26, 27]. Metastases, rather than the primary tumors themselves, are the cause of death in the vast majority of cancer patients. Interestingly, cancer cell lines in which the spontaneously mutated PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 is genetically disrupted still grow as xenografts in nude mice, though their metastatic ability is severely compromised [8]. Similarly, cell lines in which Akt1 and Akt2 are genetically disrupted form xenografts at their primary sites but do not metastasize as well as their parental lines [28]. Overexpression of Akt1 has also been shown to enhance metastasis in rodent models and Akt2 knockdown inhibited such metastasis [29]. Clinical evidence of the importance of the PI3K/Akt pathway in metastasis development has also been documented [30, 31]. The purposes of the current study were (i) to introduce a novel set of PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 specific inhibitor analogs based on an imidazopyridine core, and (ii) to test the most promising of these compounds for their in vivo activities against primary and metastatic tumors. RESULTS. Synthesis and structure?activity relationship (SAR) studies of imidazopyridine-based J-series compounds. We synthesized 121 compounds based on N'- [(1E)-(6-Bromoimidazo [1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)methylene]-N,2-dimethyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonohydrazide hydrochloride (J27), a potent PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 inhibitor reported previously [14]. Cyclization of 5-bromo-2-aminopyridine with chloroacetaldehyde gave imidazopyridine, which was formylated and further reacted with various hydrazines to provide the key intermediate compound 3. Acylation or sulfonylation of compound 3 generated the desired compounds (Supplementary scheme 1). Each of the compounds was tested for selective biochemical inhibition of PI3K isoforms in vitro. For this purpose, a baculovirus-based expression system was used to produce the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PI3K\u00a5\u00e1, PI3K\u00a5\u00e2, and PI3K\u00a5\u00e4. In the case of PI3K\u00a5\u00e3, no regulatory subunit was required for activity [32]. SAR studies began by changing R 1 from methyl (J27) to ethyl (J32). The potency for PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 was retained but selectivity against the other three isoforms increased by up to 8-fold (Supplementary scheme 1, Table 1). Increasing the size of R 1 by substituting ethyl (J32) with isopropyl (J55), iso-butyl (J46) or benzyl (J30) caused a 6 to 49-fold drop in inhibitory activity for PI3K\u00a5\u00e1. Polar groups such as ester (J43) and nitrile (J47) at R 1 did not increase potency. A switch of the sulfonyl group at X to a carbonyl (J45) did improve inhibitory activity for PI3K\u00a5\u00e2, PI3K\u00a5\u00e3 and PI3K\u00a5\u00e4, but not for PI3K\u00a5\u00e1, thus decreased selectivity for the latter. With respect to the terminal phenyl ring, deleting a methyl group at R 2 (J37) or a nitro group at R 3 (J40) resulted in greater than 3.6-fold and 1333-fold decreases in inhibitory activity for PI3K\u00a5\u00e1, respectively. However, a chloro (J101) substituent at R 2 was able to maintain potency and isoform selectivity as long as a nitro group was also present at R 3. The R 3 nitro group turned out to be critical in this configuration, as substitutions by various moieties, including carboxylic acid (J100), amino (J44), amido (J125) and methyl sulfonyl (J41) groups all impaired potency. We discovered that a substitution at the R 4 position next to the nitro group on the phenyl ring was beneficial and that the R 4 position in general accepted larger substituents without major impact on potency. Amino (J124-I), glycino (J159) and trifluoroacetylamino (J124) groups at the R 4 position increased inhibitory activity for PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 by 7.5, 3.8 and 1.4-fold, respectively, when compared to J32. Other substitutions, such as fluoro (J120), hydroxyl (J129) and various amino groups (J157, J158, J161, J162, J163), did not impact the inhibitory activity for PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 substantially. Even larger substitutions as well as oligopeptide adducts retained nanomolar potencies (e.g. J171). In summary, seventy-four of the 121 compounds had a IC 50 for PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 below 1 \u00a5\u00ecM, but of these, only 42 had IC 50's below 100 nM and 9 had IC 50's below 20 nM (examples in Fig. ?Fig.1).1). The most specific of these (J171) had ~670 -fold selectivity against PI3K\u00a5\u00e2, 60-fold against PI3K\u00a5\u00e3, and 100-fold against PI3K\u00a5\u00e4 with a potency of 19 nM for PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 (Table ?(Table1).1). More typical selectivity values were >20 (\u00a5\u00e2), >30 (\u00a5\u00e3), and >10 (\u00a5\u00e4), respectively, with a potency for PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 at 10 nM (e.g. J124). The compounds were also tested for their capacity to inhibit two common mutant forms of PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 ? E545K and H1047R [2, 33]. None of the compounds discriminated between the wild-type (wt) and mutant forms of the enzyme (data not shown). Finally, we also tested one of the compounds (J124, chosen for reasons discussed later) against a panel of 273 kinases. This compound proved to be moderately selective, inhibiting 22 of 273 tested kinases, but not mTOR, with an IC 50 of 11 nM or lower (Supplementary Table 1). J-series compounds inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells with and without mutant PI3K\u00a5\u00e1. All 42 compounds with a PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 IC 50 below 100 nM were assayed for their ability to inhibit the growth of HCT116 cells in culture. These cells were derived from a human colorectal cancer containing one mutant (H1047R) and one normal allele of the PIK3CA gene. Paired isogenic lines in which one of the two alleles was disrupted through homologous recombination have been generated [8] and were also tested. We found that the 42 compounds inhibited cell growth to varying extents, but none of them inhibited the growth of the cells with a mutant PIK3CA allele more than their isogenic counterparts with only a normal allele (example in Fig. ?Fig.2A).2A). It has previously been demonstrated that the PIK3CA mutations allow cells to proliferate in growth medium containing limiting concentrations of growth factors [2]. Cells with both genotypes were more sensitive to the compounds when grown under conditions where growth factors were limiting, but these conditions did not provide specificity for the cells with a mutant PIK3CA allele (Fig. ?(Fig.2A2A) To identify the most promising drug leads for in vivo evaluation, a matrix of cellular and biochemical potency of the 42 compounds with nanomolar IC 50's was constructed (Fig. ?(Fig.2B).2B). We searched for potent compounds that inhibited cell growth at concentrations consistent with their ability to inhibit PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 enzymatic activity. None of the compounds inhibited growth at concentrations less than their biochemical K i. Compounds that did not inhibit cell growth even at concentrations much greater than their K i's were assumed to be cell impenetrant or inactive in an intracellular environment. Four compounds (J32, J124, J124-I, and J128) with biochemical and cellular activities which we considered optimal were chosen for further analysis. To determine whether these compounds inhibited the pathway regulated by PI3K\u00a5\u00e1, we evaluated the phosphorylation of Akt1 and Akt2 in HCT116 cells following exposure to the compounds for 6 hours. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Akt1 and Akt2 proteins are reliable indicators of PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 pathway activity [8, 28]. As assessed by western blot, the four compounds all inhibited phosphorylation of Akt1 and Akt2 when used at concentrations that inhibited cell growth (example in Fig. ?Fig.2C2C). J-series compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of metastatic disease. We next tested these compounds in vivo. Through dose escalation studies, we found that the compounds were tolerated at concentrations up to 150 mg/kg when administered intraperitoneally daily for three weeks. Two of the compounds (J32, J124-I) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of subcutaneous HCT116 xenograft tumors in nude mice. Only a minor anti-tumor activity was noted (Supplementary Fig. 1), even though the compound inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt1/2 in the growing tumors (Fig. ?(Fig.2D2D). To test the compounds in a context more relevant to the proposed tumorigenic role of PI3K\u00a5\u00e1, we evaluated their ability to inhibit the development of metastases from tumors injected into the spleen. Such injections give rise to large, primary intrasplenic tumors and multiple metastatic lesions in the liver, as well as a few tumor nodules in the lungs. The tumor-bearing animals were treated daily by intraperitoneal injections of J124 or J128 at 150 mg/kg starting three days after tumor implantation. Metastatic burdens were assessed through histopathology analysis three weeks later. All mice had large intrasplenic tumors, but the mice injected with J124 or J128 had few, if any, metastatic foci in their livers compared to animals injected with the vehicle alone (Fig. ?(Fig.3A).3A). Sections of the liver and lungs revealed multiple tumor foci in control mice but not in mice treated with J124 or J128 (Fig. ?(Fig.3B3B). To quantitatively measure metastatic tumor burdens in these mice, we performed real-time PCR using human-specific primers [34]. The spleens of the mice treated with J124 or J128 showed a modest reduction in primary tumor burdens (~50%) compared to the mice treated with only the vehicle (Fig. ?(Fig.3C).3C). In contrast, the metastatic liver burden was reduced by 13-fold and 9-fold, respectively, in the mice treated with J124 and J128. There were a few metastatic lesions in the lungs of the control mice but no lesions in the lungs of the treated mice. DISCUSSION. We describe above a class of inhibitors that are highly specific for the alpha isoform of PI3K enzymes. Most published cell biologic and physiologic studies employing PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 inhibitors have used either wortmannin or LY290042. These classic compounds have proven useful but are non-specific with respect to PI3K isoforms. The compounds we have synthesized should prove superior for such research purposes and will be made freely available upon request. Furthermore, the detailed evaluation of structure activity relationships provides leads for further optimization of this and related classes of compounds. Particularly intriguing was the discovery that the R 4 position accepted very large substituents, even peptides, without major impact on potency. This finding sets the stage for the development of bi-functional compounds that may have uniquely specific activities. Our studies also provide strong pharmacologic evidence for the role of PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 in metastasis. Apart from the biologic implications of this finding, it has important practical ramifications. All anti-cancer compounds, including those targeting PI3K\u00a5\u00e1, are tested in pre-clinical models prior to their introduction into Phase I clinical trials. In general, therapeutic efficacy against a well-chosen tumor cell line is required to move forward. For example, PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 inhibitors might be tested against xenografts of human cancer cell lines which have mutations of PIK3CA, for obvious reasons. Our results show that it is not only the choice of cell line that is important for pre-clinical testing, but also the choice of the in vivo model in which the testing is performed. J124 and J128 have little activity against subcutaneous tumors, or even against intra-abdominal primary tumors, but could potently inhibit the development of metastases. These results suggest that testing of novel compounds against tumors grown subcutaneously in immunocompromised mice could be misleading, stimulating researchers to discard drugs that might be useful in the clinic. The pharmacologic data provided in this study are in perfect accord with prior genetic data. In particular, homologous recombination-mediated disruption of a mutant PIK3CA allele did not inhibit the growth of primary tumors but did inhibit metastatic growth [8]. No drug could possibly inhibit the mutant PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 isoform as completely, permanently, and specifically as a genetic knock-out. We would thus argue that any drug that is designed to inhibit this enzyme should yield similar results in vivo, exhibiting minor effects on primary tumors and major effects on metastases. And conversely, drugs that inhibit the growth of primary tumors grown subcutaneously must be doing so by off-target effects. We believe that most of the drugs now being considered or used for clinical trials have not met this straight-forward expectation. On a positive note, attention to this expectation could lead to an improved selection of drugs for future clinical trials, thereby expediting the drug development process. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Chemical compound synthesis. The full synthetic scheme and methods are described in Supplementary Scheme 1 and Supplementary Methods. PI3K expression and purification. cDNA clones of PIK3CA, PIK3CB and PIK3CG were obtained from Origene (Rockville, MD, USA). PIK3CD was generously provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals. The cDNA clones were sub-cloned into pFastBac His-Tag (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and baculovirus clones were generated by the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Invitrogen). p110\u00a5\u00e1, p110\u00a5\u00e2 and p110\u00a5\u00e4 were co-expressed in Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) with a nSH2-iSH2 fragment of the regulatory subunit p85 comprising AA residues 322 to 600 [4]. p110\u00a5\u00e3 was expressed without a regulatory subunit. Sf9 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 400 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM orthovanadate, 10 mM imidazole, and sonicated on ice for 1 minute. Proteins were purified by adding Ni-NTA Superflow beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) to the lysate and subsequent rolling for 30 min at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. Beads were washed twice with 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Imidazole, 2 mM DTT and eluted in the same buffer but with 200 mM imidazole. Purified PI3K's were mixed 1:1 with glycerol and stored at -20\u00a1\u00c6C. Biochemical PI3K inhibition assay. J-series inhibitors were dissolved, serial diluted in DMSO and deposited into 96 well plates at a final DMSO concentration of 1%. We used a novel assay to determine their potency and selectivity. In brief, micelles of 2.5 \u00a5\u00ecg L-a-Phosphatidylinositol and 2.5 \u00a5\u00ecg 1,2-Diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine were formed by sonication, mixed with the individual PI3K isoforms and added to the drug dilutions in a reaction buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, 25 mM NaCl, 0.125 \u00a5\u00ecg/\u00a5\u00ecl BSA, and 2 mM BME (final concentrations). Reactions were timed after the addition of 10 \u00a5\u00ecM ATP with 40 \u00a5\u00ecCi/ml \u00a5\u00e3-32P-ATP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and 2 mM MgCl 2 (all final concentrations). The reactions were terminated after two hours by the addition of 2 N HCl and the lipids extracted with 1:1 MetOH/Chloroform. Radio-labeled phosphatidyl-inositol-3-phosphate in the extracted organic fraction was quantified after the addition of Microscint O (PerkinElmer) using a TopCount 96 well plate scintillation counter (PerkinElmer). IC 50 concentrations and inhibition curves were calculated using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Cell-based inhibition assays. The colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 was obtained from ATCC and the generation of somatic knock-out derivatives with PI3K\u00a5\u00e1 wt or H1047R genotypes has been described [8]. Cells were seeded in McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen)supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, HyClone, Logan, UT, USA)at a density of 4000 cells per well in 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning, Corning, NY, USA). Once the cells had adhered to the plates (~5 hours after seeding), J-series inhibitors were added. All control and assay wells were adjusted to a final DMSO concentration of 1% and incubated for 48 hours. The media was removed and the adherent cells lysed by incubation for 1 hour at 37\u00a1\u00c6C with 100 \u00a5\u00ecl 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.5% Igepal (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 25 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml Proteinase K (Invitrogen), and 0.05% SYBR green (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). DNA was measured with a FLUOstar Galaxy 96-well plate reader (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC, USA), and cell numbers were approximated by DNA content. P-Akt western analysis. Phopspho-Akt levels were assayed in HCT116 cells. 1x10 6 cells/well were seeded in six-well plates and serum starved for 2 hours in McCoy's 5A medium. Drugs were pre-mixed with complete medium containing 10% FBS and incubated with the cells for 6 hours. Cells were lysed on ice with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.05% Bromophenol blue, 20 \u00a5\u00ecl 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na 3VO 4, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA) without EDTA and sonicated for 30 seconds. Phospho-Akt was assayed with Phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody (#9271, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). Subsequently the membrane was stripped and incubated with Akt1 (D-17) antibody (sc-7126, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,Santa Cruz, CA, USA)) for loading control. Intraspleenic tumor model. Intraspleenic-injected HCT116 liver and lung metastases in NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were generated as described in Erikson et. al. [28]. J-series compounds were solubilized in 1:1 DMSO/Cremophor EL (Sigma-Aldrich) and diluted 2.3-fold in water to a final concentration of 7.5 mg/ml. 400 \u00a5\u00ecl of this formulation (150 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally (IP) once a day for three weeks, beginning the third day post-surgery. Mice were sacrificed after the treatment and the liver, lungs, and spleen sampled. DNA was extracted from organs with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The qPCR assay used for quantification of human DNA in mouse organs has been described [34]. All mouse protocols were designed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Xenograft tumor model. Tumor xenografts were established by injecting 5x10 6 HCT116 cells subcutaneously into the right flanks of female nude mice. Tumor volume was measured twice weekly using electronic calipers and calculated as length x width 2 x 0.5. After tumors reached an average volume of 50 mm 3, animals were treated daily with drugs at 150 mg/kg via IP injection for three weeks. Tumor phospho-Akt levels were determined following harvest on the last day of the study. Xenografts were excised, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and pulverized with a pestle. Homogenized tissue was re-suspended in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) and protein contents normalized by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Western blots were performed as described above. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS. Acknowledgments. The authors thank Raymond Pagliarini, Surojit Sur, Carlo Rago and Mario Amzel for helpful discussions.

                "text": "Target enzyme mutations are the molecular basis for resistance towards pharmacological inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase\tBackground. Inhibitors of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) are promising cancer drugs currently in clinical trials in oncology, including APO866, CHS-828 and the CHS-828 prodrug EB1627/GMX1777, but cancer cell resistance to these drugs has not been studied in detail. Methods. Here, we introduce an analogue of CHS-828 called TP201565 with increased potency in cellular assays. Further, we describe and characterize a panel of cell lines with acquired stable resistance towards several NAMPT inhibitors of 18 to 20,000 fold compared to their parental cell lines. Results. We find that 4 out of 5 of the resistant sublines display mutations of NAMPT located in the vicinity of the active site or in the dimer interface of NAMPT. Furthermore, we show that these mutations are responsible for the resistance observed. All the resistant cell lines formed xenograft tumours in vivo. Also, we confirm CHS-828 and TP201565 as competitive inhibitors of NAMPT through docking studies and by NAMPT precipitation from cellular lysate by an analogue of TP201565 linked to sepharose. The NAMPT precipitation could be inhibited by addition of APO866. Conclusion. We found that CHS-828 and TP201565 are competitive inhibitors of NAMPT and that acquired resistance towards NAMPT inhibitors can be expected primarily to be caused by mutations in NAMPT. Background. Drug resistance is a serious concern in the treatment of cancer [1]. It can occur as either de novo or acquired resistance following therapy. Besides multi-drug resistance (MDR) caused by ABC efflux pumps, several targeted therapies have described the development of target-specific drug resistance. Thus, up to 90% of the cases of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors are due to over-expression of, or mutations in, the target kinase [2-4]. Acquired resistance can be studied by inducing resistance in vitro by growing cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of drug [1]. NAD is an essential cofactor in cell energy production and metabolism as well as the substrate for mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases [5], poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) [6] and sirtuins [7], all of these converting NAD to nicotinamide. PARPs are involved in DNA repair whereas sirtuins can increase cancer cell survival. To survive under stress and supply metabolites for cell growth malignant cells depend heavily on aerobic glycolysis for generation of ATP [8]. Glycolysis requires relatively more NAD to generate ATP compared to the oxidative phosphorylation normally occurring in non-malignant tissues. Also, cancer cells may display increased expression or activity of PARPs [9-11] and sirtuins [7] for increased DNA repair and cell survival. The first, rate-limiting step in the resynthesis pathway of NAD from nicotinamide is catalyzed by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) [12]. Nicotinamide is converted to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) using 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate and ATP as substrates. NMN is then converted to NAD by NMN adenyltransferase (NMNAT) [13]. The crystal structure of NAMPT has been resolved and it has been identified as a dimer belonging to the family of type II phosphoribosyltransferases [14-16] - each monomer containing two domains. The dimer contains two binding sites for nicotinamide located in the vicinity of the dimer interface and residues of both monomers may be part of the binding site. Inhibition of NAMPT leads to depletion of NAD [17], secondarily leading to reduction of ATP and later, cell death. Also, it leads to substrate depletion of PARPs and sirtuins and furthermore, both PARPs and sirtuins are inhibited by nicotinamide [18-20]. Tumour cells are more sensitive to NAMPT inhibition and NAD depletion due to increased ATP and NAD consumption [17]. NAMPT inhibition shows high efficacy in haematological malignancies in preclinical studies [21]. APO866 is a specific, competitive, potent inhibitor of NAMPT that displays cytotoxicity in a broad panel of cell lines (Figure ?(Figure1)1) [17,22]. APO866 has completed a phase I trial in oncology [22] and is currently undergoing several phase II trials for advanced melanoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma as well as a phase I/II trial for refractory and relapsed B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. CHS-828 (Figure ?(Figure1),1), a pyridyl cyanoguanidine, is a small molecule inhibitor displaying cytotoxicity in a broad panel of cell lines [23]. We previously identified CHS-828 as an inhibitor of NAD synthesis [24]. We found CHS-828 to function similarly to APO866 in a number of assays although the two compounds are chemically distinct. Therefore, we suggested CHS-828 as an inhibitor of NAMPT. Furthermore, we compared a cell line, NYH/CHS, with acquired, specific resistance towards CHS-828 with its wild type counterpart without identifying the molecular basis for the resistance observed towards CHS-828 and APO866. CHS-828 has completed several phase I trials in oncology [25,26] and a prodrug EB1627/GMX1777 is currently also in phase I trials [27]. Here, we present a novel, potent analogue of CHS-828, namely TP201565 (Figure ?(Figure1).1). This compound was found as part of a screen for NAMPT inhibitors and has shown activity in xenograft models. We developed a number of cell lines resistant to APO866 and TP201565. In most (4/5) of these we find mutations in the NAMPT gene that confer resistance when transfected into sensitive cells. The resistant cell lines show tumourigenicity in xenograft mouse models and in vivo resistance. Furthermore, through computer modelling and in vitro biochemistry we find that APO866, CHS-828 and TP201565 share a binding site in the active site of NAMPT, thus conclusively identifying CHS-828 and TP201565 as competitive inhibitors of NAMPT. Methods. Drugs and chemicals. CHS-828 was synthesized as previously described [28]. APO866 and TP201565 and its linkable analogue were obtained from TopoTarget A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark). All other chemicals used in this paper were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Cell lines. NYH and NYH/CHS have been described previously [24]. HCT-116, PC-3 and HEK293T were obtained from ATCC. To obtain resistance towards NAMPT inhibitors, the cell lines were cultured in a medium containing the drug in gradually increasing doses. This process was continued over an extended period of time until a level of stable, high-grade resistance was reached. Clonogenic assay. Cells were incubated with the drug at different concentrations, in triplicates with a 3-week incubation period. Afterwards, the colonies were counted as described previously [29]. The colonies were counted in triplicate. Western blotting. Western blotting of NAMPT and GAPDH was performed as described before [24]. The anti-rabbit PBEF antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) was used for the detection of NAMPT at a dilution of 1:500. Densitometry measurements were done using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and results were averaged from 2-3 separate blots. Cloning of NAMPT. Total RNA was purified from NYH/CHS, NYH/APO866, HCT-116/APO866, HCT-116/TP201565 and PC-3/TP201565 using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). mRNA was converted to cDNA using TaqMan \u00a2\u00e7 Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) which was used as template for full length PCR of NAMPT by RED Extract-N-Amp\u00a2\u00e2PCR ReadyMix\u00a2\u00e2(Sigma). PCR products of all cell lines were sequenced twice and compared to NAMPT (GenBank accession # {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"U02020\",\"term_id\":\"404012\",\"term_text\":\"U02020\"}}U02020). NAMPT flanked by BamHI/XhoI restriction sites was cloned into the TOPO TA cloning vector pCR 4-TOPO \u00a2\u00e7 (Invitrogen) and clones containing identified mutations were selected. The mutated sequences were enzymatically cut with ScaI and BsaI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and ligated into wild type NAMPT in a pET28a(+) expression plasmid backbone (a kind gift from Dr. Shin-Ichiro Imai from Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis USA) using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Rosetta\u00a2\u00e22 (DE3) competent cells (Novagen, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were transformed with the resulting vectors. Sequencing was used to confirm correct insertion of the mutations. Transfection. NAMPTwt, NAMPTH191R, NAMPTD93del and NAMPTQ388R/K342R with BamHI/XhoI restriction sites were ligated into the mammalian expression vector TRex pcDNA-4/TO/Myc.His (Invitrogen). 100 \u00a5\u00ecl sterile water containing 20 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml vector was mixed with 4 \u00a5\u00ecl FuGENE HD transfection agent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). After 20 min the mix was added to 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 HEK-293T cells plated in 2 ml DMEM medium (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates 24 hours before transfection. After 24 hours, the cells were replated for experiments or for establishment of stable cell lines (HEK/CTR and HEK/NAMPTwt) in medium containing 300 ng/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Cell proliferation was examined using CellTiterGlo (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as described previously [24] using 72 hours incubation. Recombinant protein expression and determination of enzymatic activity of NAMPT. The proteins were expressed as previously described [12] using 5 hour induction at 37\u00a1\u00c6C with 1.5 mM IPTG (Sigma) and lysis was done in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) using sonication. His-Tagged NAMPT proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and imidazole elution. Purity and yield was evaluated by SDS gel electrophoresis and A280 measurements. Purified His-Tagged NAMPT proteins (WT, H191R and D93del) were incubated in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.5], 100 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM nicotinamide, 10 mM MgSO 4, 1.5% ethanol, 0.5 mM phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, 2.0 mM ATP) for 55 min at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. The reaction was then coupled with NMNAT1 (cloned and expressed similarly to NAMPT - as above) and alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma) 10 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml each and incubated for further 5 minutes at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. NMN production by NAMPT was evaluated indirectly by measuring the fluorescence (340 nm excitation, 465 nm emission). Fluorescence created by NADH was converted to NMN amounts using a standard curve with known amounts of NMN. k cat values were averaged from calculations of k cat for 500, 1000 and 2500 ng NAMPT enzyme. IC 50 values for APO866 were obtained using the same assay setup as described above. For each enzymatic reaction 2000 ng purified NAMPT was used. The concentrations of inhibitor used to generate the inhibition curves were in the range from 0 nM - 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecM for the wild type NAMPT and 0 nM - 100 \u00a5\u00ecM for H191R. Xenograft studies. All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with national and EU legislation, and a permit to perform the specific type of experiments was obtained from the Experimental Animal Inspectorate, Danish Ministry of Justice. 10 7 cells of the paternal or resistant cell line of each of the four cell lines were injected s.c. in a mixture of PBS/matrigel in the right and left flank of female NMRI athymic mice (Taconic, Ry; Denmark), respectively. The mice were observed daily and tumour volumes were calculated from caliper measurements to estimate the radius and using the formula for a sphere. Tumours were allowed to reach a maximum volume of 1000 mm 3, where after the mouse was sacrificed. Tissue samples of the xenograft tumours were excised and placed in phosphate buffered formaldehyde (4%, pH 7) for at least a week, and were then embedded in paraffin for sectioning and H&E staining. In xenograft studies with either the wild type or APO866-resistant variant of the HCT-116 tumour cell line mice were treated with a standard two daily i.p. injections of 15-20 mg/kg APO866 in PBS with 1% hydroxypropyl-\u00a5\u00e2-cyclodextrin/12% propylene glycol on day 0-13, starting when tumour volumes were around 100 mm 3, as previously described [30]. Statistical analyses. Statistical analysis and the graphical presentation were performed using the software GraphPad Prism \u00a2\u00e7 v. 4.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Tumour doubling times were calculated using the line-fitting function for exponential growth in Graph Pad Prism, and were compared using Student's t-test. The outcome of xenografts in the treatment experiment was quantified as the number of days until the tumour of each individual mouse reached a size of 800 mm 3, expressed as survival days. The survival in each treatment group was compared using log-rank analysis. The level of significance was set to a p value of 0.05. Measurement of NAMPT activity in lysates. Activity of NAMPT was examined in PC-3 and PC-3/TP201565 as well as HEK293T cells and HEK/NAMPTwt. NAMPT activity was measured by the conversion of 14C-labelled nicotinamide to 14C-NMN using a method previously described [31,32] using 50 \u00a5\u00ecg total protein from cell lysate. Briefly, lysate was incubated with ATP, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate and 14C-nicotinamide in reaction buffer. The mix was transferred to glass fibre filter and washed in acetone to remove excess 14C-nicotinamide. Counts per minute (cpm) determined by a liquid scintillation counter. Computer modelling of NAMPT. The molecular modelling was based on the published X-ray structure of NAMPT in complex with the inhibitor APO866 (2.10 A resolution, PDB id: 2GVJ) [14]. The structure was imported into Maestro v. 9.0 release 111 and prepared for docking in the following way using the protein preparation wizard (Schrodinger Suite 2009, Schrodinger LLC, Oregon, USA). First, bond orders were assigned and hydrogen atoms were added. The four selenocysteines (Cys368 and Cys372 in both monomers) which had been incorporated to facilitate X-ray crystallographic analysis were mutated back to cysteine. Water molecules further than 5A away from the binding site were removed, and finally the hydrogen bonding network was optimized. The Glide docking module was used for the docking of the ligands. Initially, the receptor grid was generated (no vdW scaling of the receptor atoms was applied). The enclosing box for the docking of TP201565 and CHS-828 was based on the position of APO866 in the X-ray crystal structure. The hydroxyl groups in the receptor were allowed to rotate. For studies on the H191R mutation, APO866 was removed in the 2GVJ X-ray structure which had already been prepared for molecular modelling. The Prime module allowed for introduction of the mutation, which was followed by sampling of Arg191 dihedral angles to obtain the most favorable orientation of the new side chain. Precipitation assays with sepharose linked analogue of TP201565. 10 mg of the linkable analogue of TP201565 were coupled to NHS activated sepharose (GE-Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions using Na 2CO 3-containing reaction buffer and ethanolamine for blocking. HCT-116 cells were lysed in MMENGM buffer (25 mM MOPS pH[7,4], 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM NaN 3, 10% glycerol and 0,1% NP-40) with (1:200) protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) by sonication. Binding of NAMPT was conducted by mixing 30 \u00a5\u00ecg of cellular protein with 20 \u00a5\u00ecl coupled TP202648 beads and incubation for 60 min at 5\u00a1\u00c6C with end over end rotation. After incubation, the beads were spun down and the supernatant removed followed by 3\u00a1\u00bf washes with PBS (Invitrogen). Samples were boiled for 5 min at 95\u00a1\u00c6C and run on a SDS gel followed by evaluation of the precipitated NAMPT protein by western blotting. For competitive studies, lysates were pre-incubated with APO866 (250 \u00a5\u00ecM-2.5 nM) or TP201565 (250 \u00a5\u00ecM-2.5 nM) for 15 min at 5\u00a1\u00c6C before adding inhibitor linked beads and incubating for 60 min at 5\u00a1\u00c6C. Results. Development of resistant cell lines and identification of NAMPT mutations. We previously used the cell line NYH/CHS with resistance towards CHS-828 to determine the mechanism of action of CHS-828 as depletion of NAD, likely through inhibition of NAMPT [24]. From sensitive cell lines we developed a number of resistant cell lines to the NAMPT inhibitor APO866: NYH/APO866 and HCT-116/APO866, and to the CHS-828 analogue TP201565 (figure ?(figure1):1): HCT-116/TP201565 and PC-3/TP201565. Furthermore, we attempted to induce resistance in several other combinations of compounds and cell lines including NYH and HepG2 (hepatoma) cells with TP201565 and RPMI-8226 (myeloma) cells with APO866. No high-grade, stable resistance developed during 4 months of culture with drug (data not shown). Further, we have previously suggested that the resistance of NYH/CHS could be caused by a mutation in NAMPT [24]. Thus, we sequenced the NAMPT gene in the resistant cell lines and their parental lines. We found acquired mutations in NYH/CHS, NYH/APO866, HCT-116/APO866 and HCT-116/TP201565 but not in PC-3/TP201565 (Table ?(Table1).1). We also found two mutations that were present in both the HCT-116 parental cell line and in the resistant derivates. One, 903G->A, was silent (not shown) and previously identified as a SNP (rs11553095, dbSNP build 130) whereas the other, 1025A->G, resulted in a change in protein sequence of K342R. Interestingly, the mutations H191R and D93del occurred in both resistant cell lines of HCT-116 and NYH, respectively. We correlated the positions of the mutations in the protein sequence with their positions in a NAMPT crystal structure published previously [14]. We found that the acquired mutations were either located in the binding site of APO866 and nicotinamide or at the dimer interface of NAMPT whereas K342R was located distantly from either. All the mutations occurred in only one allele. In HCT-116/APO866 and HCT-116/TP201565, H191R and K342R were located on separate alleles whereas in the latter cell line, Q388R and K342R were located together on the same allele. We studied the LD 50 values of the sensitive and resistant cell lines in a clonogenic survival assay. The parental cell lines were all sensitive with LD 50 values of 1.5-11 nM for APO866 (Table ?(Table2).2). TP201565 was a more potent compound in this clonogenic assay compared to APO866 and CHS-828 (10-100 fold). Generally, the cell lines displayed a high degree of cross-resistance (Table ?(Table3).3). NYH/CHS and NYH/APO866 displayed similar resistance to the compounds (data not shown). Further, we found that the resistance observed for each cell line was retained after at least 15 weeks of culture without drug (data not shown). Interestingly, we observed LD50 values of 5-10 \u00a5\u00ecM for CHS-828 in HCT-116/APO866, HCT-116/TP201565 and PC-3/TP201565 (Table ?(Table3)3) that were lower than for APO866. Otherwise, this compound shows similar or higher potency. We also studied the protein expression of NAMPT in the parental and resistant cell lines. We found a slight up-regulation around 20% of NAMPT in HCT-116/APO866 compared to HCT-116 (figure ?(figure2A).2A). Further, we observed higher levels of NAMPT in PC-3 cells compared to other parental cell lines and a marked up-regulation in PC-3/TP201565 compared to PC-3 (around 80%). Over-expression of NAMPT variants induce APO866 resistance in sensitive HEK293T cells. To examine whether the acquired mutations are primarily responsible for the resistance observed in the resistant cell lines we over-expressed wild type NAMPT (NAMPTwt) and NAMPT containing either the H191R, D93del or Q388R/K342R mutations in HEK293T, a sensitive cell line, and measured the resistance induced by the NAMPT over-expression. We created a robust over-expression of NAMPT (Figure ?(Figure2B)2B) and we found that NAMPTwt induced an increase of resistance towards APO866 by 20 fold (p < 0.005). A further relative increase in resistance was induced by all mutant NAMPTs with the order of induced resistance being H191R>D93del>Q388R/K342R (Figure ?(Figure2C).2C). Over-expression of NAMPT containing the Q388R/K342R, H191R or D93del mutation yielded significantly greater resistance compared with wild type NAMPT over-expression (p = 0.007, p = 0.01 and p = 0.002, respectively). The H191R and D93del mutations resulted in an induced resistance in HEK293T cells towards APO866 similar to or above that of the corresponding resistant cell line. No significant difference was observed between untransfected HEK293T cells and HEK293T/CTR (empty vector). APO866 binding and enzyme activity is affected by NAMPT mutations in vitro. To study further the H191R and D93del mutations we purified recombinant NAMPTwt and NAMPT with either mutation. Using a colorimetric, coupled assay we determined the k cat for NAMPTwt (measured per active site), NAMPTH191R and NAMPTD93del. We found that the activities of NAMPTH191R and NAMPTK342R were reduced by ~50% by the mutations when compared to wild type whereas NAMPTD93del displayed 20% of the wild type activity (Figure ?(Figure3A).3A). We examined the inhibitory effect of APO866 in NAMPTwt and NAMPTH191R. The IC 50 value for inhibition of NAMPTwt was 110 nM while we found an IC 50 value for NAMPTH191R of 8585 nM (Figure ?(Figure3B).3B). Further, we found that APO866, CHS-828 and TP201565 did not inhibit NMNAT (data not shown). NAMPT mutations do not inhibit in vivo xenograft growth and maintain resistance towards APO866. We studied whether the resistance induced in vitro would have an effect on tumour viability in vivo. Xenograft models were performed for parental cell lines NYH, HCT-116 and PC-3 as well as their resistant derivates, and tumour formation rates were not affected in the resistant cell lines compared with parental cell lines. NYH tumours had a very fast doubling time in xenografts (3.7 days) followed by HCT-116 and PC-3 (8.9 and 10 days respectively). We observed no significant change in tumour doubling times for the resistant cell lines when compared to their wild type counterparts (Figure ?(Figure4A).4A). However, HCT-116/APO866 had a shorter tumour doubling time, 6.9 \u00a1\u00be 1.8 days, compared with HCT-116 (8.9 \u00a1\u00be 1.6 days) (Figure ?(Figure4A).4A). We examined tumour tissues histologically and found no obvious morphological differences between untreated sensitive xenografts and their resistant counterparts (Figure ?(Figure4B).4B). Notably, although xenograft tumours from NAMPT inhibitor-resistant derivatives of HCT-116 were found to contain many necrotic areas, similar results were observed for parental HCT-116 cells. Finally, we treated HCT-116 and HCT-116/APO866 xenografts with 20 mg/kg APO866 daily for 14 days. We observed that APO866 increased the lifespan significantly in HCT-116 xenografts, increasing the median time for a tumour to reach the size of 800 mm 3 with 32% from 22 to 29 days, whereas treating the HCT-116/APO866 xenografts with APO866 resulted in no effect on the survival (Figure ?(Figure4C),4C), confirming in vivo resistance. There were no differences in body weight between the groups (data not shown). PC-3/TP201565 and HEK293T/WT display high NAMPT activity compared to PC-3 and HEK293T. Since PC-3/TP201565 cells contained no mutations in NAMPT we examined whether the increased protein expression could be responsible for the NAMPT inhibitor resistance observed in the cell line. We studied the total in vitro activity of NAMPT from lysates of PC-3 and PC-3/TP201565 untreated and in response to inhibition with APO866. We found that the basal total activity of NAMPT was four fold higher in the resistant line compared to PC-3 in accordance with the higher expression of NAMPT (Figure 5A+B). However, the IC 50 value for in vitro lysate treatment with APO866 was not significantly increased. Similarly, we observed a strong increase in total NAMPT activity when over-expressing NAMPT in HEK293T cells compared with wild type HEK293T cells (Figure 5C+D). Likewise, the IC 50 was not increased by over-expression although the absolute NAMPT activity remained elevated at concentrations above the IC 50 compared with untreated wild type HEK293T cells. Respective protein expression levels of NAMPT for the cell lines are shown in Figure ?Figure2B2B for comparison. Finally, we detected no up-regulation of MDR 1 and 2 pumps at the mRNA level and we found that PC-3/TP201565 cells show no cross-resistance towards the histone deacetylase inhibitor belinostat, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine, the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, the toposiomerase II inhibitors and ABC substrates doxorubicin and mitoxantrone, retinoic acid, the IKK inhibitor BMS-345541 or the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (data not shown). The drugs were chosen to cover a broad spectrum of mechanisms of action (including drugs sensitive to MDR mechanisms) to give an indication of the molecular basis of resistance in PC-3/TP201565 cells. Docking studies confirm that APO866, CHS-828 and TP201565 share a common binding site. To study the relationship between the active site of NAMPT and APO866, CHS-828 and TP201565 as well as the H191R mutation, we used computer modelling based on a published x-ray structure of NAMPT [14]. The x-ray crystal structure contains several water molecules located either within or close to the binding site, hence we decided to carry out two separate docking runs; one in which water molecules within 5A of the APO866 binding site were included in the calculations, and another without water molecules. Traditionally, docking has been carried out using water-free enzyme active-site, but recently with increased accuracy of crystal structures and increased predictivity of computational chemistry the importance of water molecules has been realized [33]. If two ligands have very similar binding modes one might therefore investigate whether the crystal waters observed experimentally are also suitably positioned for the ligand where no crystal structure is available. When the water molecules were present in the binding site, the highest-ranking docking conformation of APO866 was in good agreement with the reported X-ray structure (RMS 0.2003A for non-hydrogen atoms, XP glidescore -8.92, Figure 6Aa). Surprisingly, also TP201565 was able to dock into the solvated active site with the pyridine moiety in the same \u00a5\u00f0-stacking binding pocket between Tyr18' and Phe193. The double-headed TP201565 molecule could be stabilized by displaying either the phenyl or the cyclo-hexane in the opening of the narrow pore where APO866 has a phenyl group (figure 6Ab+c, XP glidescores -8.29 and -7.53, respectively). For CHS828 we did not obtain any docked conformations with good XP glidescore (lower than -6), indicating that the water-filled active site suitable for APO866 is not compatible with this compound. Then, we turned our attention to the docking experiments carried out using the empty binding site without water molecules. The best scoring conformation of APO866 now had the phenyl group pointing towards the other pocket (XP glidescore -8.18, shown as top view, Figure ?Figure7A),7A), but a conformation similar to the crystal structure was recovered as the fifth best conformation (XP glidescore -6.98, data not shown). TP201565 was able to achieve a good conformation (XP glidescore -7.78, top-view, Figure ?Figure7B).7B). With the water molecules removed from the binding site CHS-828 was also able to obtain good interactions (XP glidescore -7.23, top-view, Figure ?Figure7C).7C). All three compounds had the pyridine substituent sandwiched between Tyr18' and Phe193. The change from the alkene group in APO866 to the guanidinium group in TP201565 and CHS828 gave rise to a H-bond between the NH-group proximal to the pyridine and Asp219. While this caused these ligands to move closer to Asp219 the long cyano-group still allowed the formation of a H-bond to Ser275. The overall position of CHS-828 in NAMPT without structural water present in the binding site is shown in Figure ?Figure7D7D. Further, we studied the effect of the H191R mutation on binding APO866 in the active site. We found that Arg-191 when modeled into NAMPT protruded into the active site and sterically completely blocked binding of APO866 (Figure ?(Figure6B)6B) as well as CHS-828 and TP201565 (data not shown). TP201565 is a competitive inhibitor of NAMPT in vitro. To confirm the notion gained from the computer modelling results that CHS-828 and its analogues are competitive inhibitors of NAMPT we used a modified analogue of TP201565 that contained a long carbon linker with a reactive amine (Figure ?(Figure8A).8A). The analogue retained cytotoxic potency within 10 fold of unmodified TP201565 (data not shown). The analogue was coupled covalently to sepharose beads and used for protein precipitation from cellular lysate of HCT-116 cells. We found that linked TP201565 could bind and precipitate NAMPT from lysate for analysis by western blot (Figure ?(Figure8B).8B). Pre-incubation of the lysate with APO866 blocked the precipitation of NAMPT suggesting that the binding sites of APO866 and TP201565 are overlapping. Since blocking NAMPT precipitation required relatively high concentrations of APO866 we examined the blocking effect of unmodified TP201565. We found that unmodifiedTP201565 was required in roughly the same concentrations for an effective abrogation of NAMPT precipitation (Figure ?(Figure8B)8B) indicating similar affinities for the binding site. Discussion. Although CHS-828 has been established as an inhibitor of NAD synthesis with a mechanism of action similar to APO866, it had not been definitively identified as an inhibitor of NAMPT. Furthermore, previous attempts to identify resistance mechanisms for CHS-828 have yielded no definite results [24,34] and resistance to APO866 has not been studied. In this study we introduce a novel potent analogue of CHS-828, TP201565, that shows >10 fold increased activity in sensitive cancer cell lines compared to APO866 and CHS-828. Using computer modelling, we find that CHS-828 and TP201565 most likely function as inhibitors of NAMPT by binding to the same site as APO866 and nicotinamide. This is further supported by the fact that a sepharose linked TP201565 analogue can precipitate NAMPT from cellular lysate and that this binding can be abrogated by co-incubation with either APO866 or TP201565. We also show how mutations in NAMPT can block the binding of APO866, CHS-828 and TP201565. Together, these data conclusively determine the pyridyl cyanoguanidines, CHS-828 and TP201565, as competitive inhibitors of NAMPT. This is in agreement with very recently reported data, which through the use of metabolic screens, in vitro NAMPT assays and computer modelling reach a similar conclusion for CHS-828 [35]. We developed four novel cell lines with acquired drug resistance towards NAMPT inhibitors and including NYH/CHS cells we observed mutations in all except PC-3/TP201565. Interestingly, the H191R mutation was detected in two different resistant cell lines derived from HCT-116. Furthermore, the distinct deletion D93del was located in both NYH/CHS and NYH/APO866. This suggests that these mutations exist in a small subpopulation of the parental cell line and that in these cases resistance has been obtained from selection rather than de novo mutations. The fact that we never obtained resistance from treating NYH cells with TP201565 despite prolonged growth with drug may be due to the fact that cells containing the NAMPTD93del were not present in the original flask used for inducing resistance to TP201565. We found that the observed mutations in NAMPT could induce resistance similar to or above that seen in the original resistant cell line which strongly suggests the mutations as the primary mechanistic cause of resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that whereas H191R abrogated NAMPT inhibitor binding in computer modelling it only reduced the enzymatic NAMPT activity in vitro by 50% - similar to what we found for the K342R mutation. The change in k cat may be due to altered substrate affinity resulting in an increased K M value. Also, we showed that the H191R mutation strongly increased the IC 50 value for APO866 inhibition in vitro. The relatively high IC 50 value of NAMPTwt obtained in vitro correlated with the previous results of others [35]. D93del on the other hand reduced k cat in vitro. Although this may reduce overall NAMPT activity compared to wild type NYH cells, it is likely that enough NAD is produced to keep up with the cellular demands and thus no growth disadvantage is inferred. NYH/CHS cells have previously been shown to retain the D93del mutation and full resistance after 30 passages without drug present in the media [24] (unpublished results, Olesen, UH). Similarly we have observed retained resistance for the remaining resistant cell lines after culture for more that 15 weeks without drug. We speculate that the induction of resistance by D93del and Q388R may be due to interference with or abrogation of dimerisation of NAMPT as both are located in the dimer interface. The NAMPT monomer may potentially retain lower enzymatic activity while not binding the known NAMPT inhibitors. Alternatively, the resistant cell lines may have adapted through reduced NAD consumption or up-regulation of other sources of NAD such as de novo synthesis. Besides the data on the H191R mutation in figure ?figure6B,6B, the observed difference in kinetics and inhibitory constants between the different mutants cannot reliably be predicted on the basis of the computer docking study performed in this study. To achieve such correlations molecular dynamics calculations of the entire enzyme (including specific solvation) for tens of nanoseconds would be necessary. However, this is far beyond what is feasible with our current computational resources. Notably, CHS-828 seems to show an upper level in LD 50 values around 5-10 \u00a5\u00ecM which is significantly lower than what is seen for APO866. We speculate that this may be due to a secondary mechanism of cytotoxicity occurring at above 1 \u00a5\u00ecM. This has also previously been suggested [36,37]. Although this currently unknown mechanism may be less important in cellular and molecular assays, it may well be of interest clinically for CHS-828, specifically since serum concentrations of the drug have been reported to reach 11 \u00a5\u00ecM in clinical trials [26]. However, it is unlikely that it is related to the previously proposed action of CHS-828 as an inhibitor of the I-\u00a5\u00eaB kinase (IKK) complex [38]. CHS-828 showed no inhibition of IKK\u00a5\u00e1, IKK\u00a5\u00e2 or TBK1 enzymes in vitro (unpublished results, Olesen, UH). APO866 displayed a surprisingly specific induction of cell death in tumour cells ranging five orders of magnitude from close to 1 nM to more than 30 \u00a5\u00ecM in vitro and a similar specificity was seen for TP201565. Finally, the specific nature required of mutations in NAMPT to confer resistance combined with the lack of resistance induced even at prolonged drug treatment in a number of combinations of cell lines and NAMPT inhibitors may indicate that resistance is not induced frequently unless a suitable mutation in NAMPT is already present in a population of tumour cells. However, we also found that the resistance is not easily reversible. Also, no significant increase in tumour doubling times occurred in vivo for the resistant cell lines. Rather, we find that HCT-116/APO866 xenografts displayed reduced tumour doubling times compared to HCT-116. As we did not observe a similar trend for PC-3/TP201565 it seems unlikely to be due to increased NAMPT levels. Rather, the induction of resistance may have resulted in the development of an unidentified growth advantage in HCT-116/APO866. Further, the in vitro resistance also conferred insensitivity to APO866 treatment in xenograft models shown for HCT-116/APO866. The PC-3/TP201565 cell line is highly resistant towards NAMPT inhibitors while displaying up-regulation but no mutations of NAMPT. The up-regulation could be due to increased gene copy number. We found that the basal NAMPT activity in the resistant cell line and also in transfected NAMPT over-expressing HEK293T/WT was much higher than in wild type PC-3 and HEK293T cells. The fact that PC-3/TP201565 cells displayed higher total activity than HEK293T/WT despite the latter having higher expression of NAMPT agrees with previous findings that endogenous NAMPT has higher activity compared to recombinant NAMPT [39]. However, the IC 50 was not significantly changed and although the absolute NAMPT activity remained high relative to wild type PC-3 and HEK293T at concentrations of APO866 up to 1-10 \u00a5\u00ecM, it would not seem to fully explain the >10 \u00a5\u00ecM LD 50 value observed for APO866 in PC-3/TP201565. Further, the resistance appeared to be specific to NAMPT inhibitors as cross-resistance to other chemotherapeutics was not observed and it was not related over-expression of MDR1 and 2. Also, CHS-828 has displayed only low to moderate sensitivity to mechanisms of MDR based on over-expression of Pgp170 and MRP, increased levels of gluthation and tubulin-associated MDR [23,40]. Thus, we believe that PC-3/TP201565 cells are likely to possess a further, yet unknown, specific mechanism of resistance. Still, the over-expression explains part of the resistance and, as also seen for HEK293T/WT cells, high levels of NAMPT may be sufficient to induce resistance which would be significant in a clinical setting. This is similar to the situation with thymidylate synthase where high expression levels predict resistance to 5-fluorouracil and a poor treatment outcome [41,42]. The crystal structure of NAMPT in complex with APO866 has previously led to suggestions on improving the potency of APO866 based on its interaction with the NAMPT binding site [14,43]. So far, published APO866 analogues have shown less activity in cellular assays [44,45]. We found that the mutations in NAMPT identified in the resistant cell lines show a tendency to locate either in the binding site or dimer interface. These mutations may directly or indirectly adjust the shape of the binding site so that it is unsuitable for the relatively large NAMPT inhibitors while still accessible for nicotinamide and NMN. Also, others have recently published a single resistant cell line showing a point mutation, G217R, which is close to the active site of NAMPT and is responsible for high-grade resistance towards CHS-828 [14,35]. We hope that the identification of a new class of NAMPT inhibitors and the characterization of resistance inducing mutations in NAMPT may be useful in developing second-generation NAMPT inhibitors with higher potency and potentially less affected by acquired resistance. Conclusions. We have identified the cyanoguanidines CHS-828 and TP201565 as direct inhibitors of NAMPT. Further, we found that NAMPT mutations located around the enzyme active site or the dimer interface could be expected to be the most frequent cause of acquired resistance towards inhibitors of NAMPT. The location of the mutations could be applied as guide for development of next-generation NAMPT inhibitors with reduced risk of development of resistance. Abbreviations.

                "text": "Molecular imaging of active mutant L858R EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase-expressing nonsmall cell lung carcinomas using PET/CT\tThe importance of the EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in the development and progression of nonsmall cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) is widely recognized. Gene sequencing studies revealed that a majority of tumors responding to EGFR kinase inhibitors harbor activating mutations in the EGFR kinase domain. This underscores the need for novel biomarkers and diagnostic imaging approaches to identify patients who may benefit from particular therapeutic agents and approaches with improved efficacy and safety profiles. To this goal, we developed 4-[(3-iodophenyl)amino]-7-{2-[2-{2-(2-[2-{2-([ 18F]fluoroethoxy)-ethoxy}-ethoxy]-ethoxy)-ethoxy}-ethoxy]-quinazoline-6-yl-acrylamide ([ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA), a radiotracer with increased selectivity and irreversible binding to the active mutant L858R EGFR kinase. We show that PET with [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in tumor-bearing mice discriminates H3255 NSCLC xenografts expressing L858R mutant EGFR from H441 and PC14 xenografts expressing EGFR or H1975 xenografts with L858R/T790M dual mutation in EGFR kinase domain, which confers resistance to EGFR inhibitors (i.e., gefitinib). The T790M mutation precludes the [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA from irreversible binding to EGFR. These results suggest that PET with [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA could be used for the selection of NSCLC patients for individualized therapy with small molecular inhibitors of EGFR kinase that are currently used in the clinic and have a similar structure (i.e., iressa, gefitinib, and erlotinib). Lung cancer is the most common cancer in both men and women, and it is responsible for 1.3 million deaths worldwide annually (1). In 2009, 219,440 Americans learned they had lung cancer. Nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) represents the majority of lung cancers (2). NSCLC treatments involving nonspecific, nonselective cytotoxic chemotherapy result in only a modest increase in survival and cause significant toxicity to the patient (3). Therapy with EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors results in dramatic antitumor activity in \u00a1\u00ad10% of Caucasian patients (young women and nonsmokers) with NSCLC and 30% of patients of East Asian ethnicities (4?11). Sequencing of the EGFR gene revealed that most tumors that respond to EGFR kinase inhibitors harbor activating mutations in the EGFR kinase domain (6, 12, 13). In patients harboring such mutations, the overall response rate is as high as 80% compared with <10% in patients with WT EGFR (6, 7?12,30). Also, the presence of these EGFR kinase mutations is associated with improved progression-free survival and overall survival after therapy with EGFR kinase inhibitors compared with patients with WT EGFR (16, 18, 20, 23, 24, 27). The most frequently detected alterations were small deletions in exon 19 (35?45%) that eliminate amino acids 747?750 (Leu-Arg-Glu-Ala), located around the active site of the kinase, and point mutations in exon 21 that result in the amino acid substitution L858R, a residue located in the activation loop (6). A secondary T790M mutation is present in \u00a1\u00ad50% of cases of NSCLC with acquired resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors (31?34). A recent study showed that the EGFR T790M mutation was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival compared with patients without detectable T790M before treatment (35). Thus, activating mutations in EGFR kinase domain and T790M secondary mutation are useful biomarkers for identifying patients who will benefit from or became resistant to therapy with EGFR kinase inhibitors (i.e., gefitinib and erlotinib). The complexity and limitations of invasive methods of analysis of EGFR mutations prompted the development of novel radiolabeled agents for noninvasive PET imaging, which may help in identification of NSCLC patients who may benefit from EGFR kinase inhibitors. The majority of the previously reported radiolabeled agents for PET imaging of EGFR at the kinase level have been derived from 4-(anilino) quinazoline pharmacophore (36, 37), which includes the ML series of 18F-labeled five 4-(anilino)quinazoline derivatives ( 18F-ML01) (38), N-{4-[(4,5-dichloro-2-fluorophenyl)-amino]quinazolin-6-yl}-acrylamide labeled with 11C( 11C-ML03) (39, 40), 4-dimethylamino-but-2-enoic acid [4-(phenylamino)-quinazoline-6-yl]-amides (ML04) labeled with 11C ( 11C-ML04) (40), 18F ( 18F-ML04) (41), and fluoro-4\u00a1\u00bfPEG-ML04 (41, 42, as well as [ 124I]IPQA (43), [ 18F]gefinitib (44), [ 11C]PD153035 (45), and [ 11C]erlotinib (46). Recent PET imaging studies in mice using several PEG-ylated anilinoquinazoline derivatives labeled with 124I, 18F, and 11C failed to show the accumulation of these radiotracers in s.c. tumor xenografts overexpressing WT EGFR (47). Clinical PET imaging studies with [ 11C]PD153035 have shown some promise for imaging EGFR expression in NSCLC patients (48). However, none of the imaging agents reported to date had exhibited selectivity for mutant EGFR kinases that confer sensitivity or resistance to inhibitors that are currently used in the clinic (49). Here, we report that the 4-[(3-iodophenyl)amino]-7-{2-[2-{2-(2-[2-{2-([ 18F]fluoroethoxy)-ethoxy}-ethoxy]-ethoxy)-ethoxy}-ethoxy]-quinazoline-6-yl-acrylamide ([ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA) has increased selectivity and irreversible binding to the L858R active mutant EGFR kinase compared with WT and T790M mutant EGFR kinases. PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging with [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA allowed for noninvasive detection of NSCLC xenografts harboring L858R activating EGFR mutations and their discrimination from NSCLC xenografts expressing the WT or L858R/T790M dual-mutant EGFR kinases. Results.  Differential Sensitivity of NSCLC Cell Lines to EGFR Kinase Inhibition.. In vitro cell growth of different NSCLC cell lines was differentially inhibited by iressa in a dose-dependent manner. The most sensitive to iressa were the H3255 cells expressing L858R mutant EGFR (IC50 1.8 \u00a5\u00ecm), whereas the H1975 cells expressing both the L858R and T790M EGFR mutations were significantly more resistant (IC50 24.4 \u00a5\u00ecm). The H441 and PC14 cells expressing WT EGFR exhibited significant resistance to iressa (IC50 46.0 and 46.3 \u00a5\u00ecm, respectively).  Differential Expression of EGFR in NSCLC Cell Lines.. The levels of total EGFR expression, as measured by ELISA, were similar in H3255 and H441 cells and higher than those in PC14 and H1975 cells (Fig. 1A). However, the level of phospho-EGFR expression varied less than twofold among the tested cell lines (Fig. 1B).  Preferential Accumulation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in NSCLC Cells with L858R EGFR Mutation.. All four cell lines showed a rapid uptake of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA during the initial phase (first 20 min). Thereafter, the accumulation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA reached a plateau in H441, H1975, and PC14 cells at about 30?40 cells/medium concentration ratio. In contrast, in H3255 cells, the accumulation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA continued to increase up for to 1 h and thereafter, reached a plateau at a cells per medium concentration ratio of 400?600 (Fig. 1C). The magnitude of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in H3255 cells was more than 10-fold higher than in H441 cells, despite the twofold lower levels of total EGFR and phospho-EGFR expression in H3255 cells than in H441 cells (Fig. 1 A and B). The radiotracer washout studies showed significant retention of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in H3255 cells (cells per medium concentration ratio of about 400), which accounted for 65% of the total accumulated radioactivity between 60 and 120 min of incubation (Fig. S1). In contrast, almost 50% of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA radioactivity could be washed out from H441 cells, more than 60% could be washed out from PC14 cells, and more than 70% could be washed out from H1975 cells. After washout in PC14 and H1975 cells, the magnitude of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA retention was less than 10 cells/medium concentration ratio. The magnitude of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in all tested cell lines was significantly decreased in the presence of iressa (100 \u00a5\u00ecM/L) in the culture medium (Fig. 1D).  Preferential and Irreversible Binding of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA to the L858R Mutant EGFR Kinase.. The autoradiograhic and Western blot analysis of electrophorograms of protein extracts from different NSCLC cells incubated with [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA showed preferential covalent binding of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA to the L858R mutant EGFR kinase domain, which corresponds to the 72-kDa protein band (Fig. 2). In H441 cells, the level of irreversible binding to the WT EGFR kinase was significantly lower than in H3255 cells. This observation became more evident when comparing the intensity of radioactive bands (Fig. 2A) and corresponding Western blot bands (Fig. 2B) of different dilutions of cellular protein extracts. In particular, the 1:10 dilution of H441 extract contained significantly more EGFR protein than the 1:10 diluted extract from H3255 cells; however, the intensity of the radioactive band corresponding to the 1:10 dilution of H3255 cells was significantly greater (at least 1 log order) than that in the 1:10 diluted extract of H441 cells. Autoradiographic detection was more sensitive than immunoblotting and chemoluminescent detection, which was evidenced by the presence of a faint radioactive band in 1:1,000 diluted extracts of H3255 cells, whereas the corresponding Western blot band was not detectable. The covalent binding of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA to the EGFR kinase domain was barely detectable in undiluted extracts of PC14 cells expressing low levels of WT EGFR and in undiluted extracts of H1975 cells expressing L858R/T790M dual-mutant EGFR.  F-PEG6-IPQA Preferentially Inhibits L858R EGFR Mutant Kinase Activity.. In vitro assays with recombinant WT and mutant EGFR kinases showed (Fig. 2C) preferential irreversible inhibitory activity of cold (nonradiolabeled) F-PEG6-IPQA against the L858R mutant EGFR (IC50 = 92 nM) compared with the WT EGFR (IC50 = 1.1 \u00a5\u00ecM) and L858R/T790M mutant EGFR (IC50 = 4.4 mM).  In Vivo PET/CT Imaging with [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA Enables Discrimination of NSCLC Expressing L858R Mutant Vs. WT and L858R/T790M Dual-Mutant EGFR.. In vivo dynamic PET/CT imaging was performed in 12 mice (6 per each tumor pair) before and after therapy with iressa. PET/CT imaging showed rapid accumulation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in H3255 and to a lesser degree, in H441 s.c. tumor xenografts (Fig. S2). The [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation at 120 min post-i.v. injection reached 2.34 \u00a1\u00be 0.13% injected dose (ID)/g in H3255 tumors and 1.59 \u00a1\u00be 0.44% ID/g in H441 tumors (Fig. 3). Tumor to muscle ratios of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation at 120 min post-i.v. injection reached the level of 2.08 \u00a1\u00be 0.19 in H3255 tumors and 1.47 \u00a1\u00be 0.08 in H441 tumors (Fig. S3A). In contrast, the level of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation was insignificant in PC14 and H1975 s.c. tumors, reaching 0.90 \u00a1\u00be 0.11% ID/g and 1.05 \u00a1\u00be 0.09% ID/g, respectively (Figs. 3 and ?and4A),4A), which was similar to the 0.94 \u00a1\u00be 0.22% ID/g observed in the muscle (reference tissue). Thus, the magnitude of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in H3255 was 1.4, 6.3, and 7.6 times higher (P < 0.001) than in H441, PC14, and H1975, respectively. Tumor to muscle ratios of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in PC14 and H1975 tumor xenografts reached equilibrium of about 1 starting at 20 min post-i.v. injection (Fig. S3A). The unidirectional rate of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation (K i), calculated using the Patlak graphical analysis, was significantly higher in H3255 tumors than in H441, PC14, and H1975 tumors (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4C and Fig. S4A). Logan's graphical analysis showed a significantly increased binding potential (BP) of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in H3255 tumors compared with other tumor xenografts (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4D and Fig. S5A). A summary of quantitative measures of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in different tumor xenografts at 120 min post-i.v. injection is provided in Table 1.  Treatment with Iressa Significantly Inhibits [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA Accumulation in NSCLCs Expressing L858R EGFR Mutant.. In vivo dynamic PET/CT imaging showed a significant reduction in [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in H3255 tumor xenografts after treatment with iressa (100 mg/kg 1 h before administration of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA) to the level of 1.38 \u00a1\u00be 0.43% ID/g (Fig. 4B) and a tumor to muscle ratio of 1.56 \u00a1\u00be 0.36 at 120 min post-i.v. injection (Fig. S3B). In contrast, the level of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in H441 tumor xenografts was 1.58 \u00a1\u00be 0.01% ID/g (Fig. 4B), and the tumor to muscle ratio was 1.77 \u00a1\u00be 0.53 at 120 min post-i.v. injection (Fig. S3B), which was similar to that before treatment (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3A). In PC14 and H1975 tumor xenografts, the magnitude and tumor to muscle ratios of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation further decreased (Fig. 4B and Fig. S3B). Both Patlak and Logan graphical analyses (Figs. S4 and S5) showed a statistically significant reduction in K i and BP of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in H3255 tumor xenografts (P < 0.05) after treatment with iressa, whereas the reduction of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in other tumor xenografts was not statistically significant (Fig. 4 C and D).  Pharmacokinetics of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in Tumor-Bearing Mice.. After i.v. injection, [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA exhibited biexponential plasma clearance kinetics with half-lives for the rapid and slow phases of 1.15 and 21.32 min, respectively (Fig. S3). At 30 min postinjection (n = 3), 16.2 \u00a1\u00be 8.6% radioactivity in blood plasma was in the form of the parent [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA, and the remaining fraction was [ 18F]F-PEG6. At 60 min postinjection (n = 3), 100% of plasma radioactivity was caused by [ 18F]F-PEG6 metabolite. The initial clearance of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA?derived radioactivity from the circulation was through the hepato-billiary route; the clearance was monoexponential, with a half-life of 31.88 min (Figs. S2 and S3 C and D). In the urine, at 30 min postinjection, only 14.6 \u00a1\u00be 4.5% of radioactivity was in the form of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA, and the rest was [ 18F]F-PEG6; at 60 min, almost 96% of radioactivity was in the form of [ 18F]PEG6, and the rest was [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA and traces of [ 18F]-fluoride. Therefore, increasing bladder radioactivity during the first 30 min predominantly represents the rate of renal clearance of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA (29.92% ID/mL per minute), whereas after some lag phase between 30 and 40 min postinjection, an increase in bladder radioactivity at the rate of 24.12% ID/mL per minute is predominantly because of the renal clearance of [ 18F]F-PEG6 metabolite.  Quantitative Autoradiography Confirms the Results of in Vivo PET/CT Imaging with [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA.. In a separate group of animals (n = 4 per tumor pair and n = 4 per treatment condition), quantitative autoradiography (QAR) showed preferential accumulation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in viable portions of H3255 tumor xenografts (Fig. S6). Also, QAR revealed intratumoral heterogeneity of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA. High levels of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA?derived radioactivity accumulated in the viable portions of H3255 tumor xenografts (3.01 \u00a1\u00be 0.84% ID/g). In contrast, no specific [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation was observed inside the necrotic tumor areas. The accumulation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in H441 tumors (2.53 \u00a1\u00be 0.15% ID/g) was lower than that in H3255 xenografts, whereas in H1975 (1.27 \u00a1\u00be 0.12% ID/g) and PC14 (1.54 \u00a1\u00be 0.14% ID/g) tumors, it was significantly lower. Pretreatment with iressa resulted in a fourfold decrease in [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in H3255 tumors (to 0.92 \u00a1\u00be 0.13% ID/g; P < 0.05) and a threefold decrease in H441 tumors (to 0.78 \u00a1\u00be 0.06% ID/g; P < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in PC14 and H1975 tumor xenografts before and after treatment with iressa (1.17 \u00a1\u00be 0.10 and 1.05 \u00a1\u00be 0.01% ID/g, respectively). Discussion. Noninvasive PET/CT imaging of EGFR expression activity and mutation status in NSCLC could aid in the selection of patients for individualized therapy with EGFR kinase inhibitors by complimenting the existing gene sequencing (24), immunohistochemical (50), and FISH analyses (51). More importantly, because repetitive biopsies of multiple tumor lesions in patients with advanced NSCLC are prohibitively traumatic, whole-body noninvasive PET/CT imaging could provide measures of EGFR expression activity in the individual tumor lesions and estimate treatment-responsive vs. -resistant tumor burden before the initiation of therapy with EGFR inhibitors (i.e., gefitinib and erlotinib); potentially, it could predict the overall outcome. This study showed significantly increased accumulation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in H3255 cells compared with H441, PC14, and H1975 cells in vitro. Because levels of expression of L858R EGFR in H3255 cells and WT EGFR in H441 cells were similar, the preferential accumulation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in H3255 tumors can be explained, at least in part, by the presence of the L585R activating mutation in the EGFR kinase domain (6, 52, 53). The L858R mutation dramatically enhances the magnitude of EGFR signaling activity in H3255 cells compared with H441 cells that overexpress WT EGFR (6, 53) and PC14 cells that express WT EGFR at a low level. Our structure?activity relationship modeling studies (SI Materials and Methods and Fig. S7) indicate that the activation status of EGFR kinase seems to be very important for the binding mode of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA and the formation of a covalent bond with Cys773. Other studies with structurally similar 4-anilinoquinazoline?based reversible inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib) have also shown that these compounds had a more than a 20-fold increase in affinity and inhibitory activity for the L858R mutant compared with WT EGFR kinase (54). A shift in equilibrium to the active state in L858R mutant EGFR kinase and the much stronger alternative binding of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA to the L858R mutant are thought to be the reasons for the more rapid covalent bond formation that leads to faster irreversible entrapment of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in cells expressing the L858R mutant EGFR. Similar explanations apply to the interpretation of in vivo PET/CT imaging studies in mice, which showed that [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA preferentially accumulates in s.c. tumor xenografts established from H3255 cells compared with moderate accumulation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in H441 tumor xenografts, low accumulation in PC14 tumors, and very low accumulation in H1975 tumors. Although H1975 cells carry the L858R EGFR mutation, the second T790M mutation causes resistance to reversible EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, by interfering with the binding of these inhibitors to the ATP binding site of EGFR kinase (32, 55). The T790 residue is located at the back of the ATP binding site and is often called the gatekeeper residue (56). This mechanism is analogous to that resulting from the T315L mutation in Bcr-Abl, which leads to imatinib resistance (57). In the EGFR?erlotinib structure, the side chain of T790 makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond to N3 of the quinazoline. In the EGFR?lapatinib structure, the threonine side chain is rotated relative to its position in the erlotinib structure and makes a number of direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the protein. Mutation of this residue to methionine is predicted to sterically block inhibitor binding, because the methionine side chain would occupy part of the same space as the quinazoline ring for both inhibitors (58). This also explains the lack of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in H1975 cells in vitro and in H1975 tumors in vivo. Autoradiographic and Western blot analyses of electrophorograms of proteins extracted from different NSCLC cells incubated in vitro with [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA also showed preferential irreversible binding of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA to the L858R mutant EGFR kinase domain compared with WT EGFR kinase and lack of irreversible binding to L858R/T790M dual-mutant EGFR kinase. Similarly, enzyme assays using recombinant WT and mutant EGFR kinases showed that nonradiolabeled cold F-PEG6-IPQA has 20-fold more potent inhibitory activity against the L858R mutant EGFR kinase compared with the WT EGFR kinase, and more than 1 log order lower inhibitory activity against the L858R/T790M dual-mutant EGFR. These data also explain the lack of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in H1975 cells in vitro and in H1975 tumors in vivo. Although H1975 cells are known to be sensitive to other irreversible inhibitors, such as EKB569 and CI1033 (55, 59), these cells exhibited significant resistance to F-PEG6-IPQA in vitro. This also suggests a different and unique mode of binding of F-PEG6-IPQA to the ATP binding site of the H1975 mutant EGFR kinase compared with EKB569 and CI1033. Preincubation of H3255 cells in vitro with the EGFR inhibitor iressa in biologically effective concentrations effectively blocked the accumulation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in these cells because of the competition of iressa for binding to the same site in the L858R EGFR mutant kinase domain. Similarly, pretreatment of tumor-bearing mice with pharmacologically effective doses of iressa blocked the accumulation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA in H3255 tumors expressing L858R EGFR mutant and to a lesser degree, in H441 tumors overexpressing WT EGFR. Therefore, it should be feasible to use PET imaging with [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA to assess pharmacodynamic characteristics and determine biologically effective doses of small molecular EGFR kinase inhibitors in individual tumors. Compared with other small molecular agents for imaging of EGFR at the kinase level reported by us previously, such as morpholino-[ 124I]-IPQA (43), [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA exhibits improved radiotracer pharmacokinetic characteristics. Notably, the biexponential clearance half-time of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA from the blood is shorter than that of morpholino-[ 124I]-IPQA (rapid and slow phases = 1.15 and 21.32 min vs. 4.8 and 552 min, respectively). This is partially because of the better water solubility of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA (LogD = 1.44) compared with morpholino-[ 124I]-IPQA (LogD = 3.8). These results support the predictions made by us and other investigators (42) that improved water solubility of the 7-oligoPEGylated aminophenylquinazoline analogs will improve the potential of this class of radiolabeled compounds to be used as radiotracers for molecular imaging of EGFR overexpressing tumors. Another reason for its superior radiotracer characteristics is that [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA is radiolabeled on the 7-(PEG6) side chain, which, on metabolic cleavage from the quinazoline core, is rapidly eliminated through renal clearance, as evidenced by the early appearance of radioactivity in the bladder. On metabolic degradation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA and similar 7-(PEG6) analogs, the 6-acrylamide aminophenyl-quinazoline pharmacophore is known to bind to both inactive and activated EGFR kinase and does not discriminate between the WT and active mutant EGFR kinases. Therefore, the aminophenyl moiety of this class of compounds is not suitable for radiolabeling, because it would render compounds that, on metabolic cleavage of 7-(PEG6) moiety, would have much higher lipophilicity and longer half-time circulation and would not adequately discriminate between the WT and L858R active mutant EGFR kinase. In contrast, [ 18F]-labeling of the 7-(PEG6) side chain ensures that radioactivity accumulation in the tumor tissue is caused only by the parent [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA compound, which irreversibly and covalently binds to the active mutant EGFR kinase domain, as was confirmed by our current in vitro studies. This is because the cleaved [ 18F]F-PEG6 side chain does not cross the cell membrane and is rapidly washed out from the extracellular space and eliminated from circulation predominantly by the renal clearance. The latter explains the low background levels in tissues that are not involved in the clearance of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA and [ 18F]F-PEG6 from the body. Lower background levels of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA compared with morpholino-[ 124I]-IPQA (43) and other previously reported agents (36?46, 48) can also be explained in part by the lower affinity of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA to the WT and inactive EGFR, expressed by normal tissues, such as the lungs, intestine, and skin. In conclusion, PET/CT with [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA could potentially be used to detect tumors expressing L858R active mutant EGFR and to select patients for individualized therapy with small molecular inhibitors of EGFR kinase that have a pharmacophore structure similar to [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA (i.e., gefitinib and erlotinib). Identification of tumors with high uptake and retention levels of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA should predict favorable responses to therapy with EGFR kinase inhibitors, whereas the lack of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation should predict resistance. Because mutations in EGFR and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) genes are almost mutually exclusive (60, 61), tumors that accumulate [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA are less likely to be driven by KRAS mutations and therefore, will be more likely to respond to therapy with EGFR kinase inhibitors. Also, after the initial course of treatment with EGFR inhibitors and before an increase in tumor growth is observed by computed tomography, repeat imaging with [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA could potentially be used to identify tumor lesions with acquired T790M mutations in the EGFR kinase domain, which should exhibit significantly lower accumulation of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA, and to justify triage to therapy with novel irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors that are effective against T790M mutants (62). Additional studies in NSCLC expressing other activating mutations of EGFR kinase (i.e., exon 19 del) should be conducted to fully assess the diagnostic potential of PET/CT imaging with [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA. Imaging with [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA PET/CT may add to the toolbox of molecular imaging approaches to the differential diagnosis of molecular?genetic subtypes of NSCLC and other EGFR-driven tumor types and for the selection and monitoring of individualized therapies with EGFR inhibitors. Materials and Methods. The [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA was prepared in high specific activity and high purity following the method described elsewhere (63). Four NSCLC cell lines expressing different levels of WT and active mutant EGFR and different sensitivity iressa were used: (i) H441 (WT EGFR; resistant) (6, 53), (ii) PC14 (WT EGFR; resistant) (64?66), (iii) H3255 (mutant L858R EGFR; sensitive) (6, 52, 53), and (iv) H1975 (L858R, T790M double-mutant EGFR; resistant) (32, 55). In vitro radiotracer uptake and washout studies were performed in monolayer cultures of these different tumor cell lines as previously described (43, 67). SI Materials and Methods contains the details for methods used to assess the sensitivity of different tumor cell lines to iressa, ELISA for measurements of EGFR expression in different tumor cell lines, irreversible covalent binding of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA to the WT, L858R, and T790M double-mutant EGFR kinases, in silico docking of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA with WT and different EGFR kinase mutants, inhibition of EGFR kinase activity in vitro, development of different s.c. tumor xenografts in mice, and PET imaging protocol in mice and data analysis. Statistical analyses included ANOVA to assess differences in the magnitude of [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation (percent ID per gram) in different tumors established from different NSCLC cell lines and to assess differences in [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation before and after treatment with iressa. Mean \u00a1\u00be SD values were calculated for each tumor type and compared using the t test for group averages. Paired Student t test was used to assess differences in [ 18F]F-PEG6-IPQA accumulation in pairs of tumors grown in the same animal (H441 vs. H3255 and H1975 vs. PC14); P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

                "text": "Inhibitors of HSP90 block p95-HER2 signaling in Trastuzumab-resistant tumors and suppress their growth\tThe anti-HER2 antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) has been proven to be effective in the treatment of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer; resistance, however invariably emerges in metastatic tumors. The expression of p95-HER2, a form of HER2 with a truncated extracellular domain that lacks the Trastuzumab binding epitope, has been implicated as a mechanism of resistance to the antibody. We utilized an in vivo tumor model that overexpresses p95-HER2 and demonstrate it to be resistant to the signaling and antitumor effects of Trastuzumab. We find that both full length and p95-HER2 interact with the HSP90 chaperone protein and are degraded in tumor cells exposed to HSP90 inhibitors in tissue culture and in vivo. Loss of expression of p95-HER2 is accompanied by downregulation of the PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathways and inhibition of cell proliferation. Chronic administration of HSP90 inhibitors in vivo results in sustained loss of HER2 and p95-HER2 expression and inhibition of AKT activation together with induction of apoptosis and complete inhibition of tumor growth in Trastuzumab-resistant, p95-HER2-overexpressing models. Thus, p95-HER2 is an HSP90 client protein, the expression and function of which can be effectively suppressed in vivo by HSP90 inhibitors. HSP90 inhibition is therefore a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for p95-HER2-mediated Trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer. Introduction. The HER2/ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is amplified in 20?30% of cases of breast cancer (Slamon et al., 1987). Amplification of HER2 is associated with activation of receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways, especially HER2/HER3-dimer dependent activation of PI3K/AKT signaling, with attendant increases in D-cyclin expression, deregulation of proliferation and desensitization of the tumor to apoptotic stimuli (Basso et al., 2002; Holbro et al., 2003; Yakes et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2001). HER2 amplification or mutational activation is oncogenic in many model systems and it is likely that, in these tumors, it is necessary for tumor initiation, progression or maintenance of the transformed phenotype (Finkle et al., 2004; Guy et al., 1992; Moody et al., 2002; Muller et al., 1988). Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized, monoclonal antibody that binds to HER2, has marked clinical benefit for patients with early or late stage breast cancers in which HER2 is overexpressed (Hudis, 2007). Trastuzumab is thought to exert multiple antitumor effects including inhibition of HER2 signaling, which leads to downregulation of the PI3K-AKT and RAS-ERK signaling pathways, and, in addition, activation of antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (Clynes et al., 2000; Cuello et al., 2001; Lane et al., 2000; Yakes et al., 2002). The antibody has antitumor activity when given alone and also enhances the effectiveness of certain chemotherapeutic agents, most notably taxanes, possibly by inhibiting antiapoptotic signaling pathways (Baselga et al., 1998; Pegram et al., 2000). Despite these pleiotropic activities, intrinsic or acquired resistance to Trastuzumab-based therapy is a common clinical phenomenon, especially in patients with metastatic disease, in whom tumor progression is almost invariable. Several potential resistance mechanisms have been described in model systems, although none of these has been completely validated in patients. These include hyperactivation of the PI3K-AKT pathway due to mutation or diminished expression of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) or mutational activation of the p110 subunit of PI3K, upregulation of other receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, c-MET, or IGF-1R, and accumulation of truncated forms of HER2 (Berns et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2001; Nagata et al., 2004; Ritter et al., 2007; Scaltriti et al., 2007; Shattuck et al., 2008). Expression of amino-terminal truncated forms of HER2 that have lost the Trastuzumab binding epitope has been demonstrated to occur in up to 30% of human breast tumors with HER2 overexpression (Molina et al., 2001). Amino-terminal truncated HER2 has been referred to as \u00a1\u00b0p95-HER2\u00a1\u00b1 because the predominant form has an apparent molecular weight of 95kD. Expression of p95-HER2 in a transgenic mouse model is sufficient for tumorigenesis (Pederson et al., 2009). The expression of p95-HER2 is clinically associated with aggressive disease, poor prognosis, and lack of response to Trastuzumab (Molina et al., 2001; Molina et al., 2002; Saez et al., 2006; Scaltriti et al., 2007). Tumors in which Trastuzumab resistance is mediated by p95-HER2 would still be expected to respond to effective inhibitors of the function or expression of the relevant species of HER2. Inhibition of the chaperone protein HSP90 is one way to achieve these ends. HSP90 is an abundant molecular chaperone that plays a role in the refolding of proteins in cells exposed to stress and is required for the conformational maturation of a subset of proteins that regulate signal transduction. Several natural products, including the ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin, bind to the ATP/ADP binding pocket of HSP90 and inhibit its function (Workman et al., 2007). This results in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HSP90 client proteins, of which HER2 is among the most sensitive. Exposure of HER2 dependent breast tumors to HSP90 inhibitors in tissue culture and in vivo causes rapid and potent HER2 degradation, concomitant inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling, and suppression of the growth in vivo of both xenograft and transgenic models (Benezra et al., 2005; Munster et al., 2002). Trastuzumab-resistant tumors that remain dependent on HER2 activity or expression might be predicted to be sensitive to HSP90 inhibition. These would include those tumors in which Trastuzumab does not effectively inhibit HER2 activity, including those that overexpress p95-HER2. However, this supposes that (1) the activity of Trastuzumab is not primarily due to induction of ADCC, (2) p95-HER2 still requires HSP90 for function, and (3) p95-HER2 is potently degraded by HSP90 inhibitors in vivo. We now report that p95-HER2 binds to HSP90 and that pharmacologic inhibitors of HSP90 cause a rapid degradation of p95-HER2 in tumor cells in tissue culture and in xenografted tumors. In a tumor model that is dependent upon p95-HER2 but not full length HER2 for its survival, HSP90 inhibition completely suppresses tumor growth. Similarly, in a Trastuzumab-resistant xenograft model that expresses high levels of both full length HER2 and p95-HER2, HSP90 inhibitors effectively induce the degradation of both proteins, inhibit PI3K/AKT signaling and suppress tumor growth in vivo. These studies support the utility of HSP90 inhibition as a rational strategy for the treatment of breast tumors in which Trastuzumab resistance is due to expression of p95-HER2. Materials and Methods. Reagents. SNX-2112 and SNX-5422 were provided by Paul Steed at Serenex, Inc. (Durham, NC, USA) (Rice et al., 2008). SNX-2112 was dissolved in DMSO for in vitro studies, whereas SNX-5422 was formulated in 1% Carboxymethylcellulose/0.5%Tween-80 for in vivo studies. Lapatinib (Tykerb) was provided by Tona Gilmer at GlaxoSmithKline (RTP, NC, USA) and dissolved 0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose/0.1% Tween-80 for in vivo studies. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was purchased from the MSKCC Pharmacy and dissolved in sterile water at 21mg/ml. 17-AAG was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, NCI, (Bethesda, MD, USA) and was dissolved in DMSO to yield 50 mg/mL and 10 mmol/L stock solutions. Cell Culture. T47D cells were transfected with full length HER2 and p95-HER2 cDNAs cloned into pIRES-Hyg under the CMV promoter as described in Scaltriti et al. 2007. Cells were maintained in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 100u/ml penicillin, 100mg/ml streptomycin, 4mM L-glutamine, 50\u00a5\u00ecg/ml Hygromycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in 5% CO2. Cell viability was determined by seeding 3000 cells/well in 96-well plates and treating with drug 24hr after plating in complete medium (200ul). Each drug concentration was tested in eight wells. Cells were exposed to drug for 96 hours and cell number was assayed with Alamar Blue reagent (TREK Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH) using a Molecular Devices Spectrophotometer. Inducible p95-HER2. MEF-3T3 tet-off and MCF-7 tet-off cell lines, engineered to express the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) (Gossen et al., 1992), were obtained from Clontech Laboratories (Clontech, Oxford, UK) and maintained in Dulbecco\u00a1\u00afs modified Eagle medium/Ham F12 1:1 (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc. Ltd., Paisley, UK) and 100 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml G418 (Gibco), at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in 5% CO 2. Cells were stably transfected with the pUHD10-3h vector encoding the cDNAs of p95HER2 starting at methionine 611 (p95HER2-M611; (Pederson et al., 2009)) by using FuGENE6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol. Independent clones were selected with 0.1mg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). The expression of p95HER2-M611 was induced by doxycycline removal detaching the cells with 0.5% Trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO) and washing three times by centrifugation. Animal Studies. 4?6 week old nu/nu athymic BALB/c female mice were obtained from the NCI-Frederick Cancer Center and maintained in pressurized ventilated caging. All studies were performed in compliance with IACUC guidelines. F2#1282 tumors were kindly provided by Gail Lewis Phillips and Mark Sliwkowski and established in nude mice by subcutaneously implanting 2\u00a1\u00bf2\u00a1\u00bf2mm-sized tumor pieces. For efficacy studies, mice with well-established tumors were selected and randomized approximately fourteen days post-implantation (Size > 200mm 3); BT-474 xenograft tumors were established in nude mice by subcutaneously implanting 0.72 mg sustained release 17\u00a5\u00e2-estradiol pellets with a 10g trocar into one flank followed by injecting 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 7 cells suspended 1:1 (volume) with reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel, Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA, USA) on the opposite side 3 days afterwards. Mice were treated with SNX-5422, 17-AAG, Trastuzumab, or Lapatinib with the indicated doses. Tumor dimensions were measured with vernier calipers and tumor volumes calculated (\u00a5\u00f0/6 \u00a1\u00bf larger diameter \u00a1\u00bf (smaller diameter) 2). For pharmacodynamic studies, mice with well-established tumors were treated and sacrificed pre-treatment and at indicated times post-treatment (two or three mice/timepoint). For xenografted MEFs, six- to eight-week-old female athymic nude-Foxn1 nu mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Italy). Soon after Doxycycline removal, the cells were harvested and counted using the Guava ViaCount Assay on a Guava PCA Platform (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA). 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 MEFs tet-off cells conditionally expressing p95HER2-M611 were injected into the right flanks of all animals. p95HER2-M611-dependent tumorigenicity of the MEF xenografts was confirmed by complete tumor shrinkage in a separate group of mice where 0.1% of Doxycycline was added to the drinking water. For the pharmacodynamics study, three groups of animals (four mice per group) were treated with a single dose of 75mg/kg of SNX5422 for 0, 6 or 24 hours respectively. Immunoblotting/Immunoprecipitation. Tumor lysates were prepared by homogenization in SDS-lysis buffer (~1ml/mg tissue) (50mM Tris-HCl, (pH7.4) 2% SDS), boiling for 10 minutes, followed by brief sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000xg (10min) and the supernatant was collected. Lysates from cells in culture were prepared by washing twice in cold PBS followed by lysis with RIPA-lysis buffer (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL, USA) or NP40-lysis buffer ([50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 1% NP40, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 40 mmol/L NaF) for immunoprecipitations, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10\u00a5\u00ecM/ml Na 3VO 4/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/DTT and 1mg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and trypsin inhibitor). Protein concentration of each sample was determined using the BCA kit (Pierce) per manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. 25 or 50\u00a5\u00ecg protein was loaded onto 7 or 10% SDS-PAGE minigels for immunoblotting. Transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes was followed by incubation with primary antibodies (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA except: HER2 ? LabVision, Fremont, CA, USA for IP, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA for Westerns; PI3K-p85 ? Upstate Biotechnology; Cyclin D1 ? Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA; HA- Santa Cruz, HER3 ? LabVision). For immunoprecipitation, 1mg of protein lysate was immunoabsorbed with 20\u00a5\u00ecg of indicated antibody or IgG control followed by protein G sepharose (or protein A-sepharose for Lane-4 of Figure-4). These conjugates were pelleted and washed 3 times with NP40 lysis buffer and resuspended in 2% SDS sample buffer. Results. Multiple laboratory models of Trastuzumab resistance have been derived from HER2 dependent breast cancer cell lines and murine tumors and have been associated with a variety of mechanisms of resistance. We surveyed models HER2 and p95-HER2 expression levels in tumor models and found that the F2#1282 expresses high levels of p95-HER2 [Figure-1A and data not shown]. The Trastuzumab-resistant, F2#1282 tumor was developed from a transgenic mouse model engineered to expresses human HER2 under the control of the MMTV promoter (Finkle et al., 2004; Lewis Phillips et al., 2008). Antibody therapy directed against the extracellular domain of HER2 in this model prevents tumor emergence, however, one tumor did grow despite treatment and was isolated and shown to express high levels of p95-HER2 (Lewis Phillips et al., 2008). In multiple HER2-breast cancer models, Trastuzumab effectively inhibits PI3K/AKT signaling and tumor growth (Supplemental Figure-1, (Yakes et al., 2002)). The effects of Trastuzumab treatment on AKT activation and in vivo tumor growth in the resistant F2#1282 model (grown as subcutaneously implanted tumors in nude mice) were assessed in Figure-1. Mice bearing tumors were treated with a single dose of Trastuzumab (20mg/kg) and sacrificed at the indicated times after dose (3 mice/timepoint). Trastuzumab treatment caused no appreciable decline in HER2 or p95-HER2 phosphorylation up to 48 hours after administration (Figure-1A, Rows-1+2). Phosphorylated forms of AKT (S473 and T308) and ERK are not inhibited and appear to be slightly induced (Row-3 and data not shown) by Trastuzumab treatment. Expression of total and phosphorylated p95-HER2 was upregulated in response to Trastuzumab treatment, particularly at 24 and 48 hours (Row-2 and data not shown). The effect of chronic treatment of Trastuzumab upon tumor growth was determined in mice treated with twice weekly Trastuzumab (Figure-1B). Trastuzumab caused only a modest slowing of tumor growth compared to untreated controls. In contrast, treatment of the HER2 dependent BT474 breast tumor xenograft with Trastuzumab resulted in inhibition of AKT phosphorylation (~58% untreated control) and concomitant complete suppression of tumor growth (Supplemental Fig-1). The resistance of F2#1282 to inhibition of AKT phosphorylation by Trastuzumab suggests that either the tumor has become HER2 independent by activating PI3K/AKT signaling by another mechanism or that the tumor remains dependent on HER2 signaling but is refractory to its inhibition by Trastuzumab. In support of the latter, treatment of these tumors with a kinase inhibitor of the catalytic activity of HER2 and HER1, Lapatinib, results in downregulation of phosphorylation of p95-HER2, HER2, AKT, and ERK and marked inhibition of tumor growth (data not shown, manuscript in preparation). We have also previously demonstrated that this model is dependent upon AKT activation as its growth in vivo is suppressed by a selective, allosteric inhibitor of AKT [She et al 2008]. Thus, both AKT signaling and tumor growth remain dependent on HER kinases in the F2#1282 model. p95-HER2 is an HSP90 client protein. HER2 binds to HSP90 and is degraded is response to HSP90 inhibitors. This results in inhibition of HER2/PI3K/AKT signaling and tumor growth (Basso et al., 2002). As F2#1282 remains HER2 dependent, its sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitors will depend in part on whether Trastuzumab-resistant, active forms of HER2 such as p95-HER2 retain their dependence on HSP90. In the resistant F2#1282 model, loss of expression of p95-HER2 in response to HSP90 inhibitors may either be due to loss of full length HER2 or to a direct dependence of p95-HER2 upon HSP90 chaperone function for its own stability. In order to separate these effects, we utilized a cell line in which HA-tagged p95-HER2 was stably transfected into the T47D cell line (Anido et al., 2006; Scaltriti et al., 2007). The T47D line is an estrogen dependent model in which the HER2 gene is not amplified. In the parental T47D, HER2 is expressed at only moderate levels and expression of p95-HER2 is not detectable. We investigated whether cellular p95-HER2 is present in a complex with HSP90. In Figure-2, HA-tagged p95-HER2 was expressed in T47D cells. Exposure of these cells to the selective HSP90 inhibitor SNX-2112 (Chandarlapaty et al., 2008) caused a marked reduction in the expression of full length and lower molecular weight forms of HER2, including p95-HER2 (Fig-2B-Lysate). Furthermore, (Fig-2A), HSP90 coimmunoprecipitates with p95-HER2-HA in anti-HA pull-downs (lane-2), but not in anti-IgG controls (lane-1) or in lysates of cells pretreated with SNX-2112 for 4 hours in which p95-HER2 has been degraded (lane-3). The complementary result can be demonstrated as well: p95-HER2-HA is immunoprecipitated with anti-HSP90 antisera (Figure-2B, lane-2) but not in IgG immunoprecipitates (Figure-2B, lane-1) or HSP90 inhibitor pre-treated immunoprecipitates (Figure-2B, lane-3). As HER2 and p95-HER2 are degraded in cells exposed to SNX-2112 for 4 hours, the absence of detectable complex in these lysates supports the specificity of the interaction. p95-HER2 is found in a complex with PI3K. Previous work demonstrated that both full length HER2 and p95-HER2 are found in a complex with HER3 which mediates activation of the PI3K-AKT survival pathway (Xia et al., 2004). This is supported by the data in Fig-2C. In the HER2-dependent, Trastuzumab-sensitive breast cancer cell line, BT474, HER2 coimmunoprecipates with HER3, a protein which, when phosphorylated, has a high affinity for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. In these cells, HER3 is phosphorylated (data not shown), and coprecipitates with p85 (Fig-2C, lane-2+4) and with activated PI3K (Hermanto et al., 2001). In the T47D-p95 transfected cells, selective immunoprecipitation of p95-HER2 with anti-HA antisera coimmunoprecipitates PI3K-p85, suggesting that p95-HER2 can specifically activate the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (lane-5). In the T47D model, p95-HER2 and HER3 do not coimmunoprecipitate raising the possibility that PI3K-p85 may bind directly to tyrosine phosphorylated p95-HER2 or to another docking protein in this model. Taken together, the data suggest that p95-HER2 is similar to full length HER2 in that it forms a complex with PI3K and thereby activates PI3K signaling. Degradation of p95-HER2 in tumors exposed to HSP90 inhibitors. The dose of SNX-2112 required to cause degradation of p95-HER2 and the kinetics of loss of expression were determined in the HA-p95-HER2 expressing T47D cell line. HSP90 inhibition results in loss of both full length HER2 (Figure-3A, row-1) and p95-HER2 (row-2) with 3 hours of exposure to drug and loss of expression persisted for at least 24 hours (lanes 3?6) after treatment. Loss of p95-HER2 is observed on immunoblot with antibodies against either HER2 or HA, suggesting that the transfected version of p95-HER2 is specifically degraded. Treatment of these cells with concentrations of drug as low as 0.1 \u00a5\u00ecM (Figure-3B, lane-2) causes both HER2 (row-1) and p95-HER2 (row-2) degradation but not degradation of non-HSP90 client proteins such as p85-PI3K (row-8). The degradation of p95-HER2 is not confined to the T47D model; it is also downregulated in response to HSP90 inhibition in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and MCF-7 cells into which it has been overexpressed [Supplemental Figure 2]. These data strongly suggest that, similar to full length HER2, the extracellular truncated p95-HER2 interacts with HSP90 and is degraded is cells exposed to HSP90 inhibitors. HSP90 inhibitors suppress p95-HER2 activated signaling. HER2 heterodimerizes with other HER kinases and potently activates ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling. The latter event plays an important role in maintaining the growth of HER2-dependent breast cancer and is sensitive to induction of HER2 degradation (Basso et al., 2002). In T47D p95-HER2 transfectants exposed to SNX-2112, degradation of p95-HER2 and HER2 is temporally associated with downregulation of PI3K-AKT (Fig 3, row 5) and ERK signaling (row 7) as assessed by loss of activated AKT (S473) and ERK (T202/Y204). Although AKT is a client protein of HSP90, its degradation occurs much later (12 hours), than loss of P-AKT (rows 5 and 6, lanes 3?5), suggesting that downregulation of the pathway is a consequence of HER2 inhibition rather than of AKT degradation or direct inhibition. The loss of activated AKT prior to total AKT is also seen in MEFs and MCF-7 cells expressing p95-HER2 [Supplemental Figure 2]. Although the degradation of other HSP90 client proteins could contribute to PI3K/AKT inhibition, we have previously shown in breast and lung cancer models that HSP90 inhibitors rapidly inhibit PI3K/AKT signaling preferentially in tumors in which the upstream activator of the pathway is an HSP90 client protein that is sensitive to HSP90 inhibition (Basso et al., 2002; Munster et al., 2002; Sawai et al., 2008). HSP90 inhibition antagonizes HER2 and p95-HER2 stimulated proliferation. T47D is a breast cancer cell line that expresses estrogen receptor and moderate levels of HER2 and harbors a PIK3CA mutation as well. Introduction of HER2 or p95-HER2 into T47D cells confers a growth advantage and renders them partially sensitive to HER kinase inhibition (Scaltriti et al., 2007). We compared the effect of Trastuzumab treatment and HSP90 inhibition upon proliferation of these cells. Cellular proliferation of the T47D cells is stimulated by transfection of either p95-HER2 (~2.5 fold) or full length HER2 (~2.9 fold) compared to proliferation of vector transfected cells (Figure-4). Trastuzumab treatment has little effect on the proliferation of either p95-HER2 (~2.2 fold above vector control) or HER2 (~2.9 fold) transfected cells. In contrast, HSP90 inhibition results in complete inhibition of cellular proliferation of the p95-HER2, HER2, or vector transfected cells. While the inhibition of vector transfected cells implies a role for other HSP90 clients in mediating survival, the inhibition of growth of the p95-HER2 transfected cells suggests that the drug may prevent rescue from growth by degrading the p95-HER2. A p95-HER2 dependent in vivo tumor model is sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors. To assess the efficacy of HSP90 inhibition in targeting p95-HER2 in vivo we utilized MEFs expressing p95-HER2 under tet-off tetracycline-controlled transactivator. The cells lack expression of full length human HER2 and expression of p95-HER2 transforms these cells and enables them to grow as tumors in nude mice. Moreover, the addition of doxycycline to the drinking of water of tumor bearing mice represses p95-HER2 expression and results in complete tumor shrinkage (data not shown) confirming the dependence of these cells upon p95-HER2 for their tumorigenicity. In Figure-5A, MEFs expressing p95-HER2 were xenografted onto nude mice. These MEFs conditionally express a p95-HER2 cDNA (M611) in the absence of doxycycline (Pederson et al., 2009). In order to assess the HSP90 dependence of these tumors we utilized SNX5422 which is an oral prodrug of SNX-2112 that is rapidly converted to SNX-2112 and functions as an in vivo HSP90 inhibitor. In Figure 5A, tumor bearing mice were treated three times/week with SNX5422 (50mg/kg PO) resulting in complete inhibition of tumor growth over the two weeks of treatment. Tumors treated with a single dose of SNX-5422 (75 mg/kg) had a marked reduction in p95-HER2 expression as seen by both immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting (Figure 5B and Supplemental Figure 3). Whereas the MEF-p95-HER2 tumor model lacks expression of full length human HER2 and is insensitive to Trastuzumab (data not shown), it is dependent upon p95-HER2 expression for growth and sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors that induce the degradation of p95-HER2. The F2#1282 Trastuzumab-resistant breast tumor model is sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors in vivo. In human breast tumors with p95-HER2 expression, full length HER2 is also typically overexpressed. To assess the HSP90 dependence of model in which p95-HER2 and full length HER2 are overexpressed, we again utilized the F2#1282 model. As shown in Figure-1, in the F2#1282 model, AKT activation and tumor growth are insensitive to Trastuzumab but the tumors retain a dependence upon HER kinase and AKT kinase function. In Figure-5C, mice bearing xenografted F2#1282 tumors were treated with a single dose of SNX5422 (75mg/kg) and sacrificed at the indicated times after dose (3 mice/timepoint). SNX5422 is an oral prodrug of SNX-2112 that is rapidly converted to SNX-2112 and functions as an in vivo HSP90 inhibitor. A single 75mg/kg dose of the oral HSP90 inhibitor is well tolerated and causes loss of expression of total and activated full length HER2 and p95-HER2 in the tumor (Figure-5C and data not shown). Decreased HER2 expression is associated with a greater than 75% decrease in phospho-AKT intensity evident three hours after drug administration and persisting at least 24 hours later. Inhibition of signaling is accompanied by loss of cyclin D1 expression and induction of apoptosis as measured by increased levels of cleaved PARP in the xenografts. In contrast to the inactivity of Trastuzumab treatment in this model, twice weekly SNX5422 (75mg/kg PO) resulted in near complete tumor growth inhibition that was sustained two weeks beyond cessation of treatment (day#31). Furthermore, we find that combining HSP90 inhibition with Trastuzumab has more potent activity than either alone and results in tumor regressions that are also appreciable well beyond the time of cessation of treatment. Discussion. The use of Trastuzumab as an agent to specifically target breast cancers with amplification of the HER2 oncogene was one of the first and most successful applications of targeted therapy for metastatic carcinomas. The broad use of Trastuzumab has resulted in an increasing prevalence of patients whose tumors have developed resistance to the therapy over time and the identification of a significant number who are resistant at the outset. However, the mechanisms underlying resistance to Trastuzumab remain obscure, in part because there is still considerable debate as to the mechanisms that underlie its antitumor activity. There are essentially two schools of thought as to its mechanism of action, one based on inhibition of HER2 functional signaling, the other focused on induction of antibody dependent cytotoxicity (Clynes et al., 2000; Yakes et al., 2002). Although there is a significant amount of data supporting the latter, most of the hypotheses and experimental data on resistance have been directed at mechanisms that prevent or bypass inhibition of signaling by Trastuzumab. Despite many putative mechanisms described in experimental models, the actual mechanisms of resistance have not been defined in patients, in large part because of the lack of biopsy studies. The experimental models that have been developed have largely focused on mechanisms that cause activation of PI3K/AKT signaling to be less dependent or independent of HER2. These include decreased PTEN function, activation of other receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. EGFR), or mutational activation of PI3K. Another potential mechanism of resistance, discussed in this paper, is the expression of forms of HER2 that are functionally active, but lack the Trastuzumab epitope. Such tumors would be predicted to remain HER2 dependent for activation of PI3K/AKT signaling but would be resistant to inhibition of the pathway by Trastuzumab. The recent finding that the HER2 kinase inhibitor Lapatinib has antitumor activity in a significant proportion of Trastuzumab-resistant, HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients suggests that many of these tumors indeed retain a dependence on HER2. p95-HER2 retains tyrosine kinase activity and has been shown to activate ERK and AKT signaling, but lacks the Trastuzumab binding site (Anido et al., 2006; Molina et al., 2002; Xia et al., 2004). Its expression in human tumors has been correlated with Trastuzumab resistance (Scaltriti et al., 2007). If this relationship is causal, such tumors would be expected to respond to modalities that inhibit p95-HER2 function or reduce its expression. HER2 is an HSP90 dependent protein that is ubiquitinated and degraded in the proteosome in response to HSP90 inhibitors. We demonstrate that p95-HER2 retains its dependence on HSP90. It is present in the cell in an HSP90 complex and is rapidly and potently degraded in cells exposed to the HSP90 inhibitor SNX-2112. This occurs at comparable concentrations of inhibitor required for degradation of full length HER2. This is compatible with work showing that HSP90 binds to a region in the catalytic domain of HER2 (Tikhomirov and Carpenter, 2003; Xu et al., 2001). HSP90 inhibitors rapidly degrade HER2 and inhibit PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling in tumor models with HER2 overexpression, whether or not they express high levels of endogenous or transfected p95-HER2 ((Basso et al., 2002; Munster et al., 2002), Figure-3?Figure-5). Moreover, we find that HSP90 inhibition potently induces degradation of HER2 and p95-HER2 in vivo and causes prolonged inhibition of AKT signaling in murine tumor models, at doses that are not toxic to the host. These data suggest that HSP90 inhibition will be useful in Trastuzumab-resistant tumors that retain HER2 dependence, especially those in which resistance is due to p95-HER2 expression. We have previously demonstrated in tissue culture models that cells transfected with p95-HER2 do not respond to Trastuzumab therapy but are sensitized to the antiproliferative effects of the HER2 kinase inhibitor Lapatinib (Scaltriti et al., 2007). In this report we demonstrate that the F2#1282 Trastuzumab-resistant xenograft model expresses high levels of p95-HER2. In this model, Trastuzumab treatment appears to further increase p95-HER2, perhaps contributing to resistance. In contrast, Trastuzumab has been shown to decrease p95-HER2 expression in the sensitive BT474 model and this has been adduced as a putative mechanism of Trastuzumab activity (Molina et al., 2001). Whether upregulation of p95-HER2 expression is necessary for resistance in F2#1282 is not certain, however, it is clear that p95-HER2 expression and mitogenic signaling are not downregulated by Trastuzumab treatment in this model. In contrast, the growth of F2#1282 tumors is quite sensitive to HSP90 inhibition. A single dose of HSP90 inhibitor is sufficient to induce rapid degradation of both p95-HER2 and full length HER2 and cause prolonged inhibition of AKT and ERK signaling, PARP cleavage, and complete cessation of tumor growth. Similarly, the HER1/2 kinase inhibitor Lapatinib also causes downregulation of HER2 signaling and significantly slows tumor growth. Taken together, these data establish that this Trastuzumab-resistant tumor model remains dependent upon HER2. In further support, we find that a genetically engineered model of p95-HER2 mediated tumorigenesis, the MEF-p95-HER2 model, is also resistant to Trastuzumab, completely dependent upon p95-HER2 expression for survival and highly sensitive to HSP90 inhibition. These data are consistent with the findings of clinical trials of alternative HER2 targeted therapies for patients with HER2 amplified breast cancer that have become resistant to Trastuzumab. Recent trials show that the HER kinase inhibitors, Lapatinib and HKI-272, and the HSP90 inhibitor, 17-AAG, have significant activity in HER2-overexpressing breast tumors that have progressed on Trastuzumab treatment (Geyer et al., 2006; Modi et al., 2007). The activity of both of these classes of agents is most likely due to their more potent or different mechanism of inhibition of HER2. This follows the pattern of resistance to other targeted therapies such as BCR-ABL inhibitors in CML or mutant EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC in which resistant tumors often retain their dependence on the targeted oncoprotein. Whether the tumors that are resistant to salvage therapy with a HER kinase or HSP90 inhibitor are still HER2 dependent, but refractory to these inhibitors, or whether they have progressed to a HER2-independent state is unknown. The current data suggests that either an HSP90 inhibitor or an effective HER kinase inhibitor can inhibit tumors in which resistance is mediated by p95-HER2 and perhaps other HER2-dependent mechanisms. Both modalities effectively inhibit AKT activation, although in F2#1282 the effects of the HSP90 inhibitor on the pathway are much more prolonged. It is not at all clear which modality is superior and, since they inhibit HER2 by different mechanisms, coadministration could conceivably inhibit HER2 function more effectively than either drug alone and with enhanced clinical benefit. Despite the resistance of F2#1282 tumors to Trastuzumab therapy alone, we have noted that it significantly enhances the antitumor activity of the HSP90 inhibitor. The combination is associated with significant tumor regression compared to the HSP90 inhibitor alone. The mechanisms through which Trastuzumab contributes to antitumor activity are unknown but could include more effective inhibition of the function of full-length HER2 or other effects of Trastuzumab on angiogenesis or tumor immunity. Recently, patients whose tumors had progressed during multiple Trastuzumab-based therapies were treated in a Phase I/II clinical trial, of the HSP90 inhibitor, 17-AAG, in the setting of continued Trastuzumab administration. The results of this trial were quite promising with a 26% objective response rate and 63% evidence of biologic response rate (Modi et al., 2008). There is no way to know whether the Trastuzumab had any effect on these results, but these and other data suggest that Trastuzumab/HSP90 inhibitor combinations are rational in patients who have not previously been treated as well as those with acquired Trastuzumab resistance.

                "text": "MYC Phosphorylation, Activation, and Tumorigenic Potential in Hepatocellular Carcinoma are Regulated by HMG-CoA Reductase\tMYC is a potential target for many cancers but is not amenable to existing pharmacological approaches. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins has shown potential efficacy against a number of cancers. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by atorvastatin blocks both MYC phosphorylation and activation, suppressing tumor initiation and growth in vivo in a transgenic model of MYC-induced HCC as well as in human HCC-derived cell lines. To confirm specificity, we show that the anti-tumor effects of atorvastatin are blocked by co-treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase product, Mevalonate. Moreover, by using a novel molecular imaging sensor, we confirm that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase blocks MYC phosphorylation in vivo. Importantly, the introduction of phosphorylation mutants of MYC at Ser62 or Thr58 into tumors blocks their sensitivity to inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase suppresses MYC phosphorylation through Rac GTPase. Therefore, HMG-CoA reductase is a critical regulator of MYC phosphorylation, activation, and tumorigenic properties. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase may be a useful target for the treatment of MYC-associated HCC as well as other tumors. Introduction. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and generally incurable malignancies with an estimated 9% 5-year survival rate (1). Hepatocellular carcinogenesis is strongly associated with hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) infection, as well as other pathological conditions resulting in liver regeneration (2), which in turn facilitates the activation of specific oncogenes, most notably MYC (3). Thus, targeted inactivation of MYC may be an effective therapy for HCC (4?6). Indeed, we have reported recently that the conditional inactivation of MYC can be sufficient to induce sustained regression of HCC (7). However, there is no existing therapy for patients that targets MYC for the treatment of any cancer. The MYC proto-oncogene family is comprised of c-MYC, N-MYC, and L-MYC and has been shown to impact almost every aspect of tumorigenesis, including promoting unrestricted cell proliferation, inhibiting cell differentiation, reducing cell adhesion, and enhancing metastasis, genomic instability and angiogenesis (8, 9). MYC functions as an oncogene upon over-expression, either due to increased expression of the myc gene or by increased stability of the MYC protein. MYC protein stability is regulated through the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway and the sequential phosphorylation of MYC at Serine 62 (S62) and Threonine 58 (T58) (10). The phosphorylation of S62 is mediated by the MAPK/ERK pathway and contributes to the stabilization of MYC. Subsequent phosphorylation of T58, mediated by GSK3\u00a5\u00e2, promotes ubiquitin-dependent MYC degradation once S62 is dephosphorylated (11?13). Mutations in these phosphorylation sites that stabilize MYC protein have been identified in human cancers, thereby highlighting the importance of S62 and T58 phosphorylation as regulators of MYC in tumorigenesis (14, 15). Hence, targeting MYC phosphorylation could be useful as an anti-cancer therapy. The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) controls the rate-limiting step in the mevalonate pathway that is essential for cholesterol biosynthesis (16). Statins were initially utilized to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase as a means to reduce the serum cholesterol level (16). However, many studies have shown that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase also has anti-tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo in multiple tumor types (17?20), including colorectal cancer (21, 22), breast cancer (23), melanoma (24), and lymphoma (25). Statins have been suggested to block tumor cell growth through the inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis, induction of apoptosis, and repression of tumor metastasis (26). Statins may mediate their anti-cancer properties through inhibition of the synthesis of lipid isoprenoid intermediates that are produced downstream of the mevalonate pathway, including farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) (19). Generally, FPP activates the Ras GTPase family while GGPP activates the Rho/Rac family by prenylating and anchoring them on the cell membrane (27). Both Ras (12, 27) and Rho/Rac family members (28) are required to phosphorylate MYC. Hence, we speculated, that by inhibiting these pathways, statins might therefore block MYC activation. Here we show that the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by atorvastatin (AT) inhibits MYC phosphorylation and activation and thereby blocks MYC-induced HCC onset and tumor maintenance. Moreover, by using a novel molecular imaging sensor that noninvasively detects c-Myc phosphorylation, we found, both in vitro in human HCC cells and in vivo in mice, that AT inhibits MYC phosphorylation. Furthermore, the introduction of mutant MYC alleles that cannot be phosphorylated on S62 or T58 prevented AT from inhibiting the in vivo tumor growth of HCC. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that AT may mediate these effects on MYC phosphorylation and activation by inhibiting Rac GTPase. Therefore, HMG-CoA reductase appears to be a critical regulator of MYC activation and may have potent activity against MYC-induced cancers. Materials and Methods. Antibodies. The antibody to Ki67 was obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA); c-MYC, Cdk4, E2F1, and Rac1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); phospho-c-MYC was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); antibodies to Tubulin and HA were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Horseradishperoxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG and sheep anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from GE Healthcare (Little Chalfond Buckinghamshire, UK) and Biotinylated anti-mouse IgG was from BD Biosciences. Cell Lines. The Huh7 and HepG2 cell lines were obtained from the ATCC originally characterized by DNA profile and cytogenetic analysis and were passaged for less than 6 months in vitro. Transgenic mice. The Tet-system was used previously to generate transgenic mice that conditionally express human c-MYC cDNA in hepatocytes, as described (7). MYC expression was induced by removing doxycycline (Dox, 100\u00a5\u00ecg/ml) from the drinking water of mice. All animals were maintained and treated in accordance with the policies of Stanford University. Atorvastatin treatment. Atorvastatin (AT, prescription formulation; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) was resuspended in PBS. AT was administered orally in 100mg/kg doses with or without 20mg/kg mevalonate (MV) 3 times a week using 20-mm feeding needles (Popper and Sons, New Hyde Park, NY). PBS was administered as a negative control. Purified AT (Sequoia Research Products, Pangbourne, United Kingdom) resuspended in 100% DMSO was used for in vitro studies. Histology and immunohistochemistry. Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 \u00a5\u00ecm were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), or analyzed by immunohistochemistry using the antibody to Ki67. DAB (Vector Laboratories, Redwood City, CA) was used to achieve color development. Proliferation assay. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates (5000 cells per well) and incubated overnight. Next, cells were treated with PBS, AT (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, or 25 \u00a5\u00ecM), 10 or 25\u00a5\u00ecM AT and 100\u00a5\u00ecM MV, 10 or 25\u00a5\u00ecM AT and 10\u00a5\u00ecM FPP, or 10 or 25\u00a5\u00ecM AT and 10\u00a5\u00ecM GGPP for 96 hours. Cell proliferation was evaluated using the3-(4, 5- dimethylthiazo-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide(MTT) assay. Data were from six replicated experiments. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). HCC cells were treated with PBS, 20 ng/mL Dox, 10\u00a5\u00ecM AT, or 10\u00a5\u00ecM AT and 100\u00a5\u00ecM MV for 24 hours. Total mRNA from HCC cells was extracted and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen (Austin, TX) and quantified by spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 2\u00a5\u00ecg of total mRNA using oligo-d(T) primers. Real-time PCR analysis was performed in an ABI PRIZM analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cell membrane fractionation and protein isolation. Cells (2x10 8) were washed 3 times with PBS and extracted in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl 2, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.4). Lysates were centrifuged at 36,000 rpm for 40 minutes using Beckman L8-70M ultracentrifuge. The membrane pellet was solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and incubated at 4\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 minutes. The solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was collected as the membrane protein fraction. Viral infection. Ad-c-MYC WT, Ad-c-MYC S62A, and Ad-c-MYC T58A viruses were kindly provided as a gift from Dr Rosalie C. Sears (Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR). Briefly, Ad-c-MYC WT, Ad-c-MYC S62A, and Ad-c-MYC T58A adenovirus were cloned by inserting c-MYC WT (Ad-c-MYC WT), c-MYC S62A (Ad-c-MYC S62A) and c-MYC T58A (Ad-c-MYC T58A) cDNA into the pADEasy-1 backbone (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transplanted tumor cells were infected as previously described (29). Briefly, SCID mice were injected with hepatocellular carcinoma cells isolated from LAP-tTA/TRE-MYC transgenic mice. Tumor masses were injected in three sites with Ad-c-MYC WT or Ad-c-MYC T58A once every week. Successful infection was confirmed by GFP co-expression in tumors (Supplementary information, Fig. S9). Mice were treated with 100\u00a5\u00ecg/mL Dox to inactivate transgenic MYC expression. Tumor growth was measured using calipers three times a week for three weeks after viral injection. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2\u00a5\u00ecg HA antibody. The precipitated proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with the antibodies indicated in the figures. Total MYC and phospho-MYC level were detected by immunoblotting, and their optical density (OD) was measured and normalized to actin band OD. The MYC phosphorylation level was determined by the ratio between phospho-MYC and total MYC. Molecular imaging of c-Myc phosphorylation. A bioluminescent sensor system that can noninvasively detect c-Myc phosphorylation was utilized to detect the AT inhibitory effect in intact cells and living mice. The sensor system utilizes the fact that S62 phosphorylation of c-Myc is required for its interaction with GSK3\u00a5\u00e2 and detects the protein interaction between GSK3\u00a5\u00e2 and c-Myc to indirectly report the c-Myc phosphorylation using a split Firefly luciferase (FL) complementation system (30). Specific GSK3\u00a5\u00e2 and c-Myc fragments are fused with the inactive C-terminal and N-terminal fragment of the split FL respectively (GSK35-433-CFL/NFL-c-Myc). Phosphorylation-induced interaction between GSK3\u00a5\u00e2 and c-Myc brings the two split fragments into close proximity and recovery of the luciferase activity. The sensor system has been validated both in intact cells and mouse xenograft model, which is described in an independent manuscript (31). For in vitro imaging, the sensor plasmids were transiently transfected into HuH7 and HepG2 cells using Superfect (Qiagen) and Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) reagent respectively. Renilla luciferase gene was co-transfected for the control of the transfection efficiency. 24hrs after transfection, cells were treated with AT with different concentration as indicated for 18hrs. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) was performed in IVIS 50 (Caliper life science, Hopkinton, MA) after adding 45\u00a5\u00ecg/ml D-Luciferin (Promega) to the cells. Cells were lysed for RL assay (Promega) and western blot analysis after imaging. For in vivo liver tumor imaging, we used a hydrodynamic injection method as previously described (32). Briefly, 2ml of saline solution containing 25\u00a5\u00ecg of the MYC sensor plasmid with CMV promoter was injected into the tail vein within 8 seconds. Mice were imaged in IVIS 200 22hrs after injection based on time course of the sensor expression as determined in control experiments (Supplementary information, Fig. S6 and S7). Results. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by atorvastatin suppresses MYC-induced HCC. The effects of inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase were examined on HCC growth in vitro and in vivo by administering atorvastatin (AT) to multiple HCC tumor cell lines derived from the LAP-tTA/TRE-MYC transgenic mice, a previously described conditional transgenic model of MYC-induced HCC using the Tet-system (7), in addition to human HCC cell lines. The murine cell lines were all generated from HCC isolated from dual transgenic animals. These cell lines are dependent upon high levels of human MYC expression, which can be inactivated upon treatment with doxycycline (Dox). Hence, in these transgenic tumor-derived cell lines, as a positive control for MYC inactivation, we used Dox to induce the suppression of transgenic MYC. Doses of AT used for our experiments were comparable to previously published studies (33, 34). Moreover, as control for nonspecific effects of statins, we confirmed that effects were reversed with co-treatment with the enzyme product of HMG-CoA reductase, mevalonate (MV). Note that because of marked differences in the pharmacokinetics between mouse and human, AT doses in mice are approximately 50-fold higher than the pharmacologically equivalent dose in humans (35, 36). First, AT inhibited the in vitro proliferation of the MYC-induced HCC murine cell line 3-4 as measured by the MTT assay (Fig. 1a and Supplementary information, Fig. S2a; 75% decrease at 10\u00a5\u00ecM and 92% decrease at 25\u00a5\u00ecM AT at 96 hours of AT treatment, p<0.0001 each). Also, AT decreased the number of cells in S-phase and G2/M from 38% to 26% as assessed by propidium iodide staining (Fig. 1b, p=0.01), and reduced Ki67 immunofluorescence from 81.4% to 31.2% following 48 hours of 10\u00a5\u00ecM AT treatment (Fig. 1c, p<0.0001). Importantly, the effects of AT on proliferation and cell cycle arrest were rescued by co-treatment with MV, the immediate downstream target of HMG-CoA reductase (Fig. 1a?c), confirming these effects are specific to inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Moreover, AT was found to similarly inhibit proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in two independently derived murine HCC cell lines, EC4 and HCC 4?4, in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary information, Fig. S1?S3). Thus, AT inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of murine HCC tumor cells in vitro. Second, AT inhibited the growth of the murine HCC 3?4 cell line transplanted into syngeneic mice by up to 80% compared with treatment by PBS or AT and MV (Fig. 1d, e, p=0.0003). Note, that FVB/N mice treated with 100mg/kg AT did not exhibit any general toxicity and, in particular, had normal liver histology and serum bilirubin levels, demonstrating the clinical effects are not secondary nonspecific hepatotoxicity (Supplementary information, Fig. S4). Therefore, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by AT has potent in vivo anti-tumor activity against murine MYC-induced HCC. Third, we interrogated the ability of AT to suppress growth in Huh7 cells, a human HCC cell line. AT blocked the in vitro growth of Huh7 cells over a 96-hour time course (Fig. 2a and Supplementary information, Fig. S2b; 69% decrease at 10\u00a5\u00ecM and 86% decrease at 25\u00a5\u00ecM AT, p<0.0001 each) while inhibiting cell cycle progression (Fig. 2b; 75% reduction in S-phase, p=0.003) and reducing Ki67 positivity (Fig. 2c; 58% reduction, p<0.0001) following 48 hours of 10\u00a5\u00ecM AT treatment. Moreover, AT suppressed the in vivo growth of Huh7 cells (Fig. 2d; PBS versus AT, p=0.03; AT versus AT+MV, p=0.04; PBS versus AT+MV, p=0.8). Co-treatment with MV blocked the effects of statin treatment, confirming that the inhibition of human HCC by AT is specific to the suppression of HMG-CoA reductase (Fig. 2a?d). Finally, we evaluated the ability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition to block the initiation of MYC-induced HCC growth in vivo in the LAP-tTA/TRE-MYC transgenic mice treated with PBS, AT, or AT with MV (Fig. 3a, left). Treatment with 100mg/kg AT versus PBS significantly delayed tumor onset and increased survival (Fig. 3a; median survival increased from 80 days to 147 days, p<0.005). Importantly, MV treatment prevented AT from inhibiting tumorigenesis (Fig. 3a). Gross pathology revealed that AT markedly reduced the size and frequency of tumor nodules (Fig. 3b, Left). H&E staining revealed histologically normal liver tissue in AT-treated mice, suggesting a robust inhibition of disease onset (Fig. 3b, Middle). AT-treat animals also exhibited evidence of inhibited cell proliferation, as indicated by reduced Ki67 staining compared to PBS-treated mice (Fig. 3b, Right; 8 \u00a1\u00be 3 positive cells versus 422 \u00a1\u00be 23 positive cells per field, p<0.02). Hence, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by AT is potent at inhibiting MYC-induced liver tumorigenesis. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase suppresses MYC phosphorylation, stability, and transactivation. MYC activation has been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation (12). Thus, we considered that AT might exert its anti-neoplastic effects by inhibiting MYC phosphorylation. Indeed, AT, but not AT with MV, was found to induce a dose-dependent down-regulation of MYC phosphorylation in vitro upon 24 hours treatment (Fig. 4a; 29% reduction at 0.5\u00a5\u00ecM, 34% at 1.0\u00a5\u00ecM, 79% at 2.5\u00a5\u00ecM, 83% at 5.0\u00a5\u00ecM, 94% at 10 \u00a5\u00ecM, and 97% at 25\u00a5\u00ecM AT; p=0.004) as well as in vivo (Fig. 4b; 93% reduction). Moreover, AT blocked MYC phosphorylation in MYC-induced murine lymphoma, osteosarcoma and lung cancer, as well as in human breast cancer cell lines (data not shown). In turn, the de-phosphorylation was associated with a reduction in MYC protein levels in vitro (Fig. 4a; 17% reduction at 0.5\u00a5\u00ecM, 40% at 1.0\u00a5\u00ecM, 9% at 2.5\u00a5\u00ecM, 41% at 5.0\u00a5\u00ecM 69% at 10\u00a5\u00ecM and 91% at 25\u00a5\u00ecM AT, p=0.002) and in vivo (Fig. 4b; 57% reduction, p=0.04). Importantly, the inhibition of MYC phosphorylation by AT not only reduced MYC levels but appeared to dramatically inhibit MYC transcriptional activation as illustrated by the reduced mRNA expression of canonical target genes ODC and nucleolin, both in murine (Fig. 4c; 72% reduction for ODC, p=0.003; 76% reduction for nucleolin, p=0.03) and in human HCC upon 24 hours of 10\u00a5\u00ecM AT treatment (Fig. 4d; 64% reduction for ODC, p=0.016; 59% reduction for nucleolin, p=0.008; Supplementary information, Fig. S8b). Thus, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase blocks MYC phosphorylation, reduces MYC protein levels, and inhibits MYC transactivation. Noninvasive molecular imaging to measure in vivo MYC phosphorylation. To evaluate the effects of inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase on MYC phosphorylation in situ in a living host, we utilized a novel molecular imaging sensor system (31). The sensor system consists of two parts: 1) a peptide corresponding to the phospho-regulated domain of MYC fused to the N-terminal domain of Firefly luciferase (FL) and 2) the C-terminal domain of FL fused to a peptide fragment of GSK3\u00a5\u00e2 that recognizes phospho-MYC (Fig. 5a). When co-expressed in an intact cell, MYC phosphorylation can be detected via interaction between the MYC and GSK3\u00a5\u00e2 peptides, thereby localizing the N- and C-termini of FL in close proximity, conferring luciferase activity. Renilla luciferase (RL) is co-transfected as a control for transfection efficiency. The full-length Firefly luciferase (FL) was also transfected independently into these cells as a control for the direct effect of AT on luciferase activity. We confirmed that this imaging method could detect the dose dependent reduction of c-Myc phosphorylation in human Huh7 and HepG2 cells upon 18hrs of AT treatment (Fig. 6b,c and Supplementary information, Fig. S5, p<0.0001). Next, this imaging sensor was used to monitor MYC phosphorylation in vivo. The sensor system was introduced in liver cells of LAP-tTA/TRE-MYC mice by hydrodynamic injection. Two groups of transgenic mice (n=3 each) had MYC activated at the same time and were treated with either AT or PBS. The MYC sensor was imaged at day 0 and day 15 post-treatment. The PBS-treated group showed no significant change of the sensor signal, while the AT-treated group showed 72% reduction of the sensor signal at day 15 of treatment (Fig. 5d,e; AT-treated mice day 0 versus day 15, p=0.038; PBS-treated day 0 versus day 15, p=0.638). Notably, AT-mediated inhibition of MYC phosphorylation in vivo was associated with a 44% and 56% down-regulation in the expression of downstream target genes, E2F1 and Cdk4 (Supplementary information, Fig. S8a), further demonstrating the inhibition of MYC activity. Hence, a novel imaging sensor was used to show that the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by AT inhibits MYC phosphorylation in vivo. MYC phospho-mutants confer resistance to the inhibition of HMG-CoA Reductase. To examine if inhibition of MYC phosphorylation mediates the anti-cancer effect of AT, we introduced phospho-mutants of MYC into HCC tumor cell lines. First, recombinant adenovirus was used to express MYC that is mutated with either an Alanine substitution at either S62 or T58 (Ad-MYC S62A and Ad-MYC T58A) and hence cannot be regulated by phosphorylation at these sites (37). AT treatment at 10\u00a5\u00ecM for 24 hours dramatically suppressed WT MYC but failed to significantly inhibit protein levels of either S62A MYC or T58A MYC (Fig. 6a; MYC S62A versus MYC S62A+AT, p=0.09; MYC T58A versus MYC T58A+AT, p=0.06). Thus, we concluded that phospho-regulation through either S62 or T58 is necessary for AT to suppress MYC expression. Using an antibody specific for phospho-S62 and -T58, we show that AT inhibits phosphorylation in T58A MYC similar to wild-type MYC (Fig. 6a, 62% reduction for MYC WT, p=0.01; 68% reduction for MYC T58A, p=0.008). These data show that the reduction of phospho-MYC by AT appears to occur by preventing S62 phosphorylation. However, the reduction of total MYC protein cannot occur without T58 phosphorylation. In addition, HCC cells expressing the S62A MYC mutant were less sensitive whereas cells expressing T58A MYC were completely insensitive to the inhibition of proliferation upon AT treatment (Fig. 6b, 26% reduction for WT, p<0.001; 17% reduction for S62, p<0.0001; no reduction for T58, p=0.8). Thus, inhibition of HMG Co-A reductase suppresses MYC activation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Next, we investigated whether the MYC phospho-mutants could suppress the ability of the inhibition of HMG Co-A reductase to block HCC tumor growth in vivo. Syngeneic hosts were transplanted with MYC-induced HCC cells that were then injected with Ad-MYC WT, Ad-MYC S62A, or Ad-MYC T58A. Tumor growth was monitored in response to AT, PBS, or AT with MV treatment (Fig. 6c). The adenoviral delivery of the MYC phospho-mutants was confirmed by co-expression of GFP (Supplementary information, Fig. S9). To suppress the conditional transgenic MYC expression, mice were treated with doxycycline, thereby resulting in the effective knock-in of the Ad-MYC WT, Ad-MYC S62A, or Ad-MYC T58A constructs into the HCC cells. HCC growth upon injection of Ad-MYC WT showed 66% inhibition by 100mg/kg AT but not by PBS or AT and MV treatment (Fig. 6d, Left, PBS versus AT, p=0.01; AT versus AT+MV, p=0.007). However, HCC tumors that were injected with Ad-MYC S62A exhibited only 44% inhibition of tumor growth upon treatment with AT (Fig. 6d, Middle, PBS versus AT, p=0.02; AT versus AT+MV, p=0.03). Tumors that were injected with Ad-MYC T58A showed complete rescue from sensitivity to AT treatment (Fig. 6d, Right, PBS versus AT, p=0.56; AT versus AT+MV, p=0.03). Therefore, MYC phosphorylation is necessary for AT to inhibit MYC-induced HCC tumor growth. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase may block MYC activity through Rac GTPase. We examined if the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase blocks MYC activation through Rac GTPases. Statins block production of the isoprenoids farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (23, 38, 39). FPP prenylates the Ras, Rheb, and PTP4A3 family while GGPP prenylates the Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 family of small GTPases (16). Previous studies suggest that Ras and Rac/Rho families of GTPases may contribute to the regulation of MYC phosphorylation (25). Thus, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase is likely to prevent MYC phosphorylation through these GTPases To explore the role of GTPases in mediating inhibition of MYC phosphorylation, we performed several experiments. First, to control GTPase activity, we supplemented growth media with either FPP or GGPP before 96hrs AT treatment of MYC-induced murine HCC cells in vitro. Both MV and GGPP restored HCC cell proliferation to levels similar to DMSO controls (Fig. 7a; DMSO versus AT+MV, p=0.07; DMSO versus GGPP, p=0.053), whereas FPP demonstrated significantly less reduction in AT-mediated growth inhibition (DMSO versus FPP, p<0.002). Similarly, in Huh7 cells, GGPP was more potent than FPP in abrogating the effect of 96hrs of 10\u00a5\u00ecM AT on proliferation (Fig. 7b; 16% reduction for DMSO versus AT+MV, p <0.01; 16% reduction for DMSO versus GGPP, p<0.01; 32% reduction for DMSO versus FPP, p<0.001). In addition, GGPP was more efficient in rescuing the transcription of multiple MYC target genes than FPP, including Cdk4 and E2F1, following 24 hours of 10\u00a5\u00ecM AT treatment (Supplementary information, Fig. S10, 40?45% reduction for FPP, p<0.001; 25?60% increase for GGPP, p<0.03). MYC phosphorylation was restored to levels similar to PBS-treated controls when media containing 10\u00a5\u00ecM AT was supplemented with GGPP but not with FPP (Fig. 7c; 76% reduction for FPP, p=0.001; 21% reduction for GGPP, p=0.02). Therefore, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase appears to inactivate MYC through the inhibition of the Rho/Rac pathway. Finally, we examined the potential role of the Rac/Rho/Cdc42 pathway as a mechanism by which AT suppresses MYC activation. First, we investigated if AT was influencing the membrane localization of Rac1. Indeed, 24-hour treatment with 10\u00a5\u00ecM AT resulted in the delocalization of Rac1 from the plasma membrane (Fig. 7d; 83% reduction for AT, p<0.001). As a control, we showed that treatment with MV blocked these effects, as did treatment with GGPP (Fig. 7d; no change for PBS versus AT+MV, p=0.08; 37% increase for PBS versus GGPP, p<0.03). Notably, AT had little effect on Ras localization (data not shown). Second, using a Rac pull-down assay, 24 hours of 10 \u00a5\u00ecM AT treatment was shown to reduce Rac1 activity by 77% (Fig. 7e). Thus, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by AT appears to suppress activation of the Rac pathway, suggesting that AT in blocks MYC phosphorylation and activation via inhibition of Rac. Discussion. Here, we demonstrate that MYC phosphorylation, activation, and thereby tumorigenic potential are regulated by HMG-CoA reductase. In particular, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins suppresses MYC phosphorylation and activation. The consequences of these effects on MYC include preventing HCC initiation as well as inhibiting the in vivo growth of established murine and human HCC tumors. Moreover, statins, by blocking HMG-CoA reductase, inhibit GTPase activity, thereby resulting in MYC dephosphorylation and inactivation, which is essential for their anti-cancer therapeutic effect (Fig. 7f). Hence, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by AT may be an effective strategy for the inhibition of MYC in the treatment and prevention of HCC. Importantly, we confirmed the anti-tumor effects of statins that we observed both in vitro and in vivo were specific to HMG CoA reductase because they could be readily reversed by co-treatment with MV. We note that the AT doses we used in mice appear to be higher than generally used in humans. However, it is well known that, because of differences in the pharmacokinetics, murine doses have to be 50-fold higher than in humans (35, 36). Moreover, we confirmed that the anti-tumor dose of AT did not exhibit in vivo toxicity (Fig. S4) and hence is likely to be achievable in humans. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase was found to block MYC phosphorylation. First, AT treatment blocks MYC phosphorylation in murine and human HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Concomitant treatment with MV abrogates the ability of AT to block MYC phosphorylation and activation and mediate its suppressive effect on HCC growth, indicating that the anti-neoplastic effect of AT is via the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (Fig. 4). Second, a novel phosphorylation sensor was used to demonstrate in situ in human HCC cells and in vivo in living mice (Fig. 5). This phospho-sensor may be a useful approach to develop therapies that target MYC phosphorylation. Third, mutations in two MYC phosphorylation sites, specifically S62 and T58, blocks the ability of AT to inhibit tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, HMG-CoA reductase activity is important to the regulation of MYC phosphorylation. We infer that MYC phosphorylation is an essential component of the mechanism by which statins mediate their anti-neoplastic properties. The introduction of mutant MYC alleles in HCC tumor cells reduced their sensitivity to statins in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, the differential ability of S62A and T58A MYC to block the effect of AT in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 6) suggests that AT-mediated reduction in phospho-S62 would therefore result in MYC phosphorylated at only T58, which is rapidly degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner (12, 13). Our results are consistent with a role of S62 and T58 phosphorylation in MYC stability and transcriptional activity and, most importantly, their role in tumorigenesis (12). However, we note that S62/T58 phosphorylation has not always been found to regulate MYC stability (40). We conclude that the inhibition of MYC phosphorylation may be important to the mechanism by which the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins exerts its anti-neoplastic properties. Many reports suggest that statins have anti-neoplastic properties (25, 41?44). Many mechanisms have been proposed including: the inhibition of the ErbB2 pathway (45), the blocking of the interaction between the lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (46), the suppression of geranylgeranylation of the Rho family proteins (47), and the prevention of the prenylation of RhoA and downstream activation of focal adhesion kinase, AKT, and beta-catenin (23). Although we cannot preclude any of these possibilities, our results are consistent with the notion that the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by AT in HCC cells blocks MYC phosphorylation likely through the inhibition of small GTPases in the Rac pathway (Fig. 7). Our results are the first to suggest that HMG-CoA reductase regulates MYC activation via Rac. We are currently investigating the signaling intermediates that may function between Rac and MYC to mediate the anti-neoplastic effect of AT. Previously, it has been suggested that Rac regulates MYC (28). Rac1 can inhibit protein phosphatase PP2A (48), which has been shown to dephosphorylate MYC at S62 (13). One possible mechanism suggested by our work is that AT inhibition of Rac can result in activation of PP2A, which subsequently dephosphorylates MYC at S62 and induces the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of T58-phosphorylated MYC (Fig. 7f). Our results illustrate that the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins may be useful in the treatment and prevention of human HCC. HCC is increasing in incidence, has a generally dismal prognosis, and there are few treatment options (49). Statins were developed to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase in the liver to reduce cholesterol. Hence, they may be aptly suited for treating cancers of the liver. Moreover, statins are well tolerated in humans and may be useful in the prevention of HCC in patients at high risk (49). Notably, some clinical studies have suggested that that the statin, pravastatin, may have clinical activity in patients with HCC (50, 51), while other studies have not found clinical benefit (52). A possible explanation for this possible discrepancy in the benefit from statins is that clinical activity could depend upon the activation status of MYC. Also, AT may be a more effective statin for the treatment of HCC. We conclude that MYC phosphorylation is a critical mechanism by which the inhibition of HMG-CoA Reductase by statins mediates their anti-neoplastic effects. We have shown that a novel molecular imaging sensor may be useful for the identification through high-throughput methods of new therapeutic agents that inhibit MYC phosphorylation and activation. Importantly, statins may be effective agents to inhibit MYC function as a treatment for HCC. Supplementary Material. 1. 10. 11. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Pazopanib reveals a role for tumor cell B-Raf in the prevention of HER2+ breast cancer brain metastasis\tPurpose. Brain metastases of breast cancer contribute significantly to patient morbidity and mortality. We have tested pazopanib, a recently approved anti-angiogenic drug that targets VEGFR1-3, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 and c-kit, for prevention of experimental brain metastases and mechanism of action. Experimental Design. In vitro assays included B-Raf enzymatic assays, western blots and angiogenesis assays. For in vivo assays, HER2 transfectants of the brain seeking sublines of MDA-MB-231 cells (231-BR-HER2) and MCF7 cells (MCF7-HER2-BR3, derived herein) were injected into the left cardiac ventricle of mice and treated with vehicle or pazopanib beginning on day 3 post-injection. Brain metastases were counted histologically, imaged and immunostained. Results. Treatment with 100 mg/kg pazopanib resulted in a 73% decline in large 231-BR-HER2 metastases (p<0.0001) and 39% decline in micrometastases (p=0.004). In vitro, pazopanib was directly anti-proliferative to 231-BR-HER2 breast cancer cells and inhibited MEK and ERK activation in vitro despite B-Raf and Ras mutations. Enzymatic assays demonstrated that pazopanib directly inhibited the wild type and exon 11 oncogenic mutant, but not the V600E mutant forms of B-Raf. Activation of the B-Raf targets pERK1/2 and pMEK1/2 was decreased in pazopanib treated brain metastases while blood vessel density was unaltered. In the MCF7-HER2-BR3 experimental brain metastasis model, pazopanib reduced overall brain metastasis volume upon MRI imaging by 55% (p=0.067), without affecting brain metastasis vascular density. Conclusions. The data identify a new activity for pazopanib directly on tumor cells as a pan-Raf inhibitor, and suggest its potential for prevention of brain metastatic colonization of HER2+ breast cancer. Introduction. The majority of cancer patients succumb to metastatic disease or the consequences of its treatment. While metastasis to any site in the body is a devastating event, the brain may represent a \u00a1\u00b0final frontier\u00a1\u00b1. Brain metastases are ten-fold more prevalent than primary tumors of the brain (1), concentrated in lung and breast carcinomas and melanoma. In breast cancer, brain metastases occur predominately in the HER2+ and triple negative subtypes (2). The incidence of brain metastatic disease has increased to approximately 35% in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (3?6). The majority of HER2+ metastatic patients experienced a brain relapse when either responding to treatment systemically or experiencing stable systemic disease, and up to 50% of deaths were due to brain disease (7?9). Current treatments are palliative including steroids, cranial radiotherapy, and surgical resection. Brain metastases are designated an unmet medical need by the US Food and Drug Administration. The mechanistic basis of brain metastasis has been investigated using brain tropic breast cancer cell lines. Several molecular pathways have been reported to contribute to brain metastatic potential including HER2 (10), VEGF-A (11), integrin \u00a5\u00e1 v\u00a5\u00e2 3 (12) and Stat3 (13). We developed a quantifiable brain metastasis mouse model using a brain seeking variant of the MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell line (231-BR). When injected into the left cardiac ventricle, 231-BR cells produce numerous metastases. HER2 transfectants of 231-BR produced comparable numbers of micrometastases as controls, indicating that the ability of tumor cells to arrive in the brain and complete the first few rounds of division was not affected by HER2 overexpression; however, large metastases were 2.5?3 fold more prevalent (10). The role of angiogenesis in brain metastasis has been controversial. The brain is highly vascularized and several reports describe a co-option of the existing vasculature by metastasizing tumor cells (14) (15); others reported a role of VEGF-induced angiogenesis (11). Pazopanib represents a new addition to the multi-targeted VEGFR inhibitors, inhibiting the ATP binding pockets of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 and c-kit in the low nanomolar range. Anti-angiogenic activity was demonstrated in corneal pocket and bFGF plug assays, and anti-tumor activity was demonstrated in numerous xenografts (16). Pazopanib was recently FDA approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, and clinical testing is ongoing in a variety of other cancer histologies (17?20). Here, we report efficacy and mechanistic studies of pazopanib in the 231-BR-HER2 model. We found that pazopanib can directly affect tumor cells in addition to endothelial cells and report a new activity for this drug as a B-Raf inhibitor. Pazopanib efficacy on brain metastasis colonization was confirmed in a second, new model of brain metastasis using a brain seeking clone of the MCF7-HER2 cell line. These data identify pazopanib as a potential new drug for the prevention of brain metastasis from HER2+ breast cancer. Materials and Methods. Drugs. Pazopanib and lapatinib were provided by GlaxoSmithKline through a Material Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with NIH. For in vitro experiments, pazopanib and lapatinib were reconstituted in DMSO and stored at ?80\u00a1\u00c6C. For in vivo experiments, pazopanib was suspended in 0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose with 0.1% Tween 80 (vehicle). Raf inhibitor was purchased from Calbiochem and MEK inhibitor (U0126) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Cell lines and in vitro experiments. Primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) were purchased and cultured per the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions (Cell Systems). The human MDA-MB-231-BR (231-BR) cell line and the HER2 transfectant were previously described (10, 19). The MCF7-HER2 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Dennis Slamon (University of California Los Angeles, CA) and maintained in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. Standard procedures were used for western blot analysis, cell cycle and viability assays. Specific details for these assays and siRNA experiments can be found in Supplemental Materials and Methods. B-Raf kinase assay. To analyze the effect of pazopanib on B-Raf activity, components of a Raf kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) were incubated with MEK1, and pMEK levels were determined on western blots. Details of the techniques are in Supplemental Materials and Methods. Animal Experiments. All experiments were conducted under an approved Animal Use Agreement with the NCI. For 231-BR-HER2 cells: 5- to 7-week-old female Balb/c nude mice (Charles River Laboratories) were inoculated with 1.75\u00a1\u00bf10 5 cells in the left ventricle of the heart. Mice were randomly assigned to receive vehicle or pazopanib (30 or 100 mg/kg) twice daily by oral gavage, starting 3 days post-injection for 21 days. Histologic analysis is described in Supplemental Materials and Methods. For MCF7-HER2-BR3 cells: for establishment of the BR3 cell line see Supplemental Material and Methods. Athymic nude mice were injected with 1\u00a1\u00bf10 6 cells in the left cardiac ventricle. Additionally, mice received a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg/kg Depo-estradiol one day before tumor cell injection and once a week throughout the duration of the study. On day 3 post-injection, mice were randomized to either vehicle or pazopanib (100 mg/kg) twice daily by oral gavage. After 6 weeks, 10 mice per group were randomly chosen for MRI. After MRI, all mice were euthanized and the brain frozen as described in Supplemental Materials and Methods. MRI imaging of brain metastases is described in Supplemental Materials and Methods. Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses are described in Supplemental methods. Results. Pazopanib inhibits human brain microvascular endothelial cell growth. To confirm the anti-angiogenic activity of pazopanib, its effect on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) was analyzed. The IC 50 for pazopanib for anchorage-dependent growth was 2 \u00a5\u00ecM and 1 \u00a5\u00ecM after 48 h and 72 h, respectively (Fig. S1A). In an in vitro tube formation assay, pazopanib disrupted 50% of the network at 1\u00a5\u00ecM (Fig. S1B and C). Pazopanib abrogated the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 with disruption of downstream PLC\u00a5\u00e31 (Fig. S1D). Pazopanib also disrupted the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway through decreased phosphorylated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 and affected the phosphorylation of 70S6K. Our findings confirmed that pazopanib targeted endothelial cells, affecting cell growth, VEGFR-induced signaling, and tube formation. Pazopanib inhibits 231-BR breast cancer cell growth and the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The brain-seeking derivative of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (231-BR) expresses VEGFR1 (Fig. 1). We therefore hypothesized that pazopanib could also directly target tumor cells. In vitro assays were performed using vector (231-BR-vector) and HER2 transfectants (231-BR-HER2) of the 231-BR cell line. In an anchorage-dependent growth assay, the IC 50 of pazopanib was 5 \u00a5\u00ecM for both cell lines after 96 hours of culture (Fig. 1A). This dose was considered physiologically relevant because it was in the same range as the in vitro growth inhibition of lapatinib on 231-BR cells (21). We therefore deciphered the signaling pathways disrupted by pazopanib on both 231-BR-vector and 231-BR-HER2 cell lines. VEGFR1 phosphorylation was inhibited by pazopanib at 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecM (Fig. 1B). Analysis of downstream pathways focused our attention on the Ras-Raf-ERK1/2 pathway. Despite the fact that 231-BR cells harbor two oncogenic mutations in the Ras-Raf-ERK1/2 pathway (K-Ras G13D and B-Raf G464V in exon 11) (22), a clear decrease in MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed with pazopanib treatment. Downstream targets of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 were also affected including a decrease in phospho- and total c-jun, phospho-p70S6K and cyclin D1, and an increase in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. Cell cycle analysis was performed using vehicle or 5\u00a5\u00ecM pazopanib. At 72h of culture, vehicle treated 231-BR-vector and 231-BR-HER2 cells were spread throughout the cycle, with 57.99% and 61.03% of cells in G0/G1, 19.97% and 18.02% in S phase and 22.05% and 20.95% in G2/M, respectively. In contrast, pazopanib induced a complete cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 in both cell lines (Fig. 1C). No cleaved caspase 3 staining was observed after culture with pazopanib (data not shown). These results suggest that pazopanib induced a cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis. In summary, the principle effect of pazopanib on tumor cells was the inhibition of the constitutively activated Ras-Raf-ERK1/2 pathway, which questioned the mechanism of action of this compound. Pazopanib directly targets B-Raf. It was unlikely that pazopanib could decrease pERK1/2 solely through an interaction with established targets (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 and c-kit), because all of these targets are upstream of Ras and B-Raf, which are constitutively activated in 231-BR cells. Consequently, we hypothesized that pazopanib directly targeted B-Raf. In an enzymatic assay, pazopanib was incubated with B-Raf protein and inactive MEK1, and B-Raf activity was measured by the phosphorylation level of its substrate, MEK1 (Fig. 2A). Increasing concentrations of pazopanib inhibited the phosphorylation of MEK1. As a positive control, a non-clinical Raf inhibitor inhibited MEK1 phosphorylation; as a negative control, lapatinib, a kinase pocket inhibitor of HER2 and EGFR, had no effect on phospho-MEK1. Thus, pazopanib directly targeted wild type B-Raf. Pazopanib was then tested in an enzymatic assay using total lysate from three tumor cell lines to investigate the spectrum of its B-Raf inhibitory activity (Fig. 2B). The MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line transfected with HER2 exhibits activated wild type B-Raf downstream of HER2 overexpression (23). The 231-BR cell line expresses the mutated G464V form of B-Raf in exon 11 and the melanoma cell line SKMEL28 harbors the common mutation V600E in exon 15 of B-Raf (24). MEK phosphorylation by B-Raf was inhibited by pazopanib in cell lysates from the HER2 activated wild type B-Raf cell line as well as the exon 11 B-Raf mutant cell line, but not from the line harboring a V600E mutation. These data confirmed the inhibitory effect of pazopanib on B-Raf activity and showed that pazopanib had enhanced inhibitory activity for the G464V mutant form of B-Raf. In independent experiments using recombinant proteins, the dissociation constant (Ki) of pazopanib for wild type B-Raf was 59.2 nM and for B-Raf V600E was 148 nM, a 2.5 fold difference, confirming the lesser activity toward V600E B-Raf 5. Consistent with its effects as a B-Raf inhibitor, the anti-proliferative activity of pazopanib on 231-BR-HER2 cells was similar to that of non-clinical Raf and MEK (U0126) inhibitors (Fig. 2C). Pazopanib had been previously identified as targeting C-Raf (25). A complex signaling pathway has been described recently in which B-Raf heterodimerizes with C-Raf and each can modulate the other protein\u00a1\u00afs level of activity (26)(27?28). Experiments were therefore conducted to ascertain the importance of B-Raf relative to C-Raf. Specific knockdown of B-Raf using two siRNA constructs was performed in 231-BR-vector cells (Figure 2D). Neither siRNA construct affected C-Raf expression. Knockdown of B-Raf expression was sufficient to reduce ERK activation, suggesting that C-Raf inhibition is not necessary for the inactivation of this pathway in 231-BR-vector cells. Similar results were observed using MCF7 cells with wild type B-Raf activated by HER2 transfection (Figure 2E). In independent experiments, the dissociation constant (Ki) of pazopanib for wild type C-Raf was 91 nM vs. 59.2 nM for B-Raf, identifying a ~1.5-fold better affinity for B-Raf than for C-Raf 5. Taken together, the data indicate that pazopanib is a pan-Raf inhibitor, but that targeting of the B-Raf pathway is likely a significant determinant of its ERK inhibitory activity. Pazopanib prevents the brain metastatic outgrowth of the 231-BR-HER2 human breast cancer cell line. We asked if pazopanib was effective in preventing brain metastasis and investigated its mechanism of action in vivo. The 231-BR-HER2 cell line was injected in the left cardiac ventricle of nude mice and treatment with vehicle, 30 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pazopanib started 3 days after cell injection. Mice were treated twice daily by oral gavage for 21 days. To quantify the effect of pazopanib on metastatic tumor cell colonization of the brain, the number of large metastatic lesions and micrometastases were quantified in H&E-stained brain sections (Table 1 and Fig. S2). A cutoff of 300 microns in a single dimension was chosen to separate large metastases from micrometastases because it is proportional to a ~5mm MRI detectable lesion in a human brain. The 231-BR-HER2 cells produced a mean of 101.9 micrometastasis per brain section in the vehicle treated mice. Treatment with 30 mg/kg pazopanib resulted in a 25% decrease to 76.4 micrometastasis (NS); treatment with 100 mg/kg resulted in a 39% decline in micrometastasis to 61.7 (p=0.004). The efficacy of pazopanib in preventing large brain metastases was more pronounced. The 231-BR-HER2 cells produced a mean of 3.92 large metastases per section in the vehicle treated mice. Treatment with 30 mg/kg pazopanib resulted in a 51% decline to 1.93 large metastases (p=0.0002); treatment with 100 mg/kg resulted in a 73% decline to 1.05 large metastases (p<0.0001). Figure S2 presents representative pictures from H&E-stained brain sections for each treatment. Both the number and size of the brain metastases were inhibited. Since radiation therapy is the mainstay of treatment for brain metastasis, in vitro experiments were conducted to identify any radiosensitization effect with pazopanib. Pazopanib did not enhance the radiation sensitivity of the 231-BR-vector cell line in vitro (Fig. S3). Pazopanib inhibits 231-BR-HER2 brain metastases through tumor cell Raf, but not anti-angiogenic pathways. It is unknown if pazopanib targeted anti-proliferative (Raf-MEK-ERK) and/or anti-angiogenic pathways in brain metastasis. The phosphorylation level of the Raf targets MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in brain metastatic cells was analyzed. Twenty-five micrometastases and all large metastases per brain section for five mice per treatment group were scored for antibody staining on a 0 ? 3+ intensity scale (Fig. 3). In the mice treated with vehicle, the staining for pERK1/2 was approximately equally divided between the low (score 0/1+) and high (2+/3+) intensity groups. In contrast, 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of pazopanib induced a significant increase of approximately 2-fold in the number of brain metastases that were 0/1+ staining, with only 3?8% of lesions exhibiting 2+/3+ staining (0/1+ staining; 30 mg/kg vs vehicle: 92% vs 56%, p=0.0005; 100 mg/kg vs vehicle: 97% vs 56%, p=0.0009). The same trend was observed with pMEK1/2 staining. Pazopanib treatment induced a shift in pMEK1/2 staining from 48% of metastases in the 2+/3+ group in the vehicle group to 15% or less for the treatment groups (0 and 1+ staining; 30 mg/kg vs vehicle: 85% vs 52%, p=0.005; 100 mg/kg vs vehicle: 91% vs 52%, p=0.002). pAKT staining was not affected by pazopanib treatment, providing a control for specificity (Fig. 3). Therefore, pazopanib effectively decreased the phosphorylation of B-Raf targets without altering markers in a different pathway. Brain tissues were stained for CD31 to analyze the blood vessel density of metastases between treatment groups, as well as that of the normal unaffected brain (Fig. 4). The blood vasculature was distinct between the normal brain and metastases. Indeed, blood vessel density was slightly but statistically significantly higher in the normal brain compared to the metastases (normal brains of vehicle treated mice: 61.4 \u00a1\u00be 6.53 vessels/high power field vs. 44.2 \u00a1\u00be 2.30 in brain metastases, p=0.006). The percentage of brain area covered by blood vessels was actually larger in the metastases than in normal brain (vehicle treated mice: 2.90 \u00a1\u00be 0.398% of area in normal brain vs. 4.15 \u00a1\u00be 0.335% of brain metastases area) (Fig. 4). This difference reflected fewer, but dilated blood vessels in the metastases, demonstrating that metastatic colonization induced remodeling of blood vasculature. Pazopanib treatment had no effect on either the normal brain or the metastatic vasculature. In the normal brain, the number of blood vessels per high power field was 61.4 \u00a1\u00be 6.53 in the vehicle group versus 63.5 \u00a1\u00be 5.32 and 55.2 \u00a1\u00be 5.06 in the 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg pazopanib treated groups, respectively. The small decrease in blood vessel density with pazopanib treatment did not achieve statistical significance. In the brain metastases, the number of blood vessels was 44.2 \u00a1\u00be 2.30 per high power field in the vehicle treated group versus 42.2 \u00a1\u00be 4.36 and 46.8 \u00a1\u00be 4.35 in the 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg pazopanib treated groups, respectively. The same trend was observed for the percent of area covered by blood vessel (Fig. 4A and B). Pazopanib prevents the brain metastatic outgrowth of the MCF7-HER2-BR3 human breast cancer cell line. To evaluate the efficacy of pazopanib in an independent brain metastatic model, we developed a brain seeking cell line using the MCF7 breast cancer cells transfected with HER2. After three rounds of intracardiac injection, brain dissection, cell culture and re-injection into mice, the MCF7-HER2-BR3 cell line produced a single brain metastasis compressing and invading the hypothalamus and thalamus region and sometimes extending further to the Pons of the brain in approximately 70% of mice injected. Similar in vitro experiments as those performed on the 231-BR model were conducted using the MCF7-HER2-BR3 cell line. Pazopanib inhibited 50% of cell viability at ~7 \u00a5\u00ecM and a Raf inhibitor and MEK inhibitor produced similar effects (Fig. S4A). Pazopanib at low dose induced a slight increase in pERK1/2 but, at higher doses, a decrease was observed (Fig. S4B). This trend was previously described in recent papers (26, 28). Cell cycle analysis showed that, after 72h of vehicle treatment, 55.67% of cells were in G0/G1, 30.96% were in S phase and 13.36% are in G2/M. Five \u00a5\u00ecM pazopanib induced a complete cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 (Fig. S4C). Using this model, mice were treated with vehicle or 100 mg/kg pazopanib, starting 3 days post-injection and extending for six weeks thereafter. MRI analysis was performed on the brains of mice on day 42 post-injection and tumor volume calculated. Ten mice per treatment arm were randomly chosen for MRI analysis. Four mice from the control arm had to be euthanization 5 days before the end of the experiment, compared to one mouse from the pazopanib treated arm. For the MRI analysis, seven of ten mice per experimental arm developed brain metastases. Metastasis volume for all lesions calculated and representative MRI images are shown (Figure 5A and B and Supplemental Figure S5). Brain metastases were heterogeneous in size in the vehicle treated group. The average metastatic tumor volume in the vehicle treated group was 45.4 mm 3 (95% CI: 18.1?72.7), while the average metastasis size in the pazopanib treated group was 20.5 mm 3 (95% CI: 15.2?25.8). This corresponds to a 55% reduction in metastasis volume, representing a statistical trend (p=0.067). One hemisphere of the brain was selected to be immediately frozen in OCT a priori, for analysis of blood vessel density and percent of blood vessel coverage (Figs. 5C and D). Remodeling of blood vasculature was also observed in this model. The blood vessel density was slightly decreased in the metastases compared to normal brain but did not reach statistical significance (p=0.15). However blood vessels were much more dilated in metastases: the blood vessels covered 2.00 to 2.16% of normal brain area and 6.02 to 6.46% in the metastases (both p<0.0001) (Fig. 5D). Nevertheless, no effect of pazopanib was observed among metastases or normal brain in terms of blood vessel density (Fig. 5C) or vessel area (Fig. 5D). Figure 5E is representative photographs of normal brain tissues. Representative photographs of blood vessels in metastatic tissue are shown in figure 5F. The data confirm vessel remodeling in brain metastases but fail to demonstrate an anti-angiogenic effect of pazopanib. Discussion. We report a new activity for the multi-kinase inhibitor pazopanib, the inhibition of tumor cell B-Raf activity. B-Raf has been identified as an oncogene and B-Raf mutations are found in approximately 7% of human cancers with the highest frequency in malignant melanoma (29?32). Drugs targeting B-Raf have been reported with distinct profiles of activity against the wild type and mutated forms of B-Raf and its family members (24, 33?34). Our findings emanated from the observation that pazopanib inhibited the proliferation of 231-BR tumor cells directly. Pazopanib has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer cells and multiple myeloma cells as well (35?36). Interestingly, inhibition of tumor cell proliferation by pazopanib was accompanied by inhibition of the MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 pathways, despite the fact that 231-BR cells harbor Ras and B-Raf mutations. None of pazopanib\u00a1\u00afs reported targets could account for this effect in 231-BR cells, since all of the receptors lie upstream of Ras and B-Raf mutations. Enzymatic assays confirmed a direct inhibition of wild type B-Raf activity by pazopanib in the high nM range. Using tumor cell lysates, pazopanib inhibition of B-Raf extends to the G464V mutation found in 231-BR cells as well as wild type activated by HER2 overexpression. The B-Raf G464V mutation is relatively rare in cancer but has been reported in an ovarian cancer cell line (37), and a nearby mutation, G469V, was identified in melanoma 6. However almost no inhibitory activity of pazopanib toward the V600E B-Raf form was observed. Independent enzymatic Ki studies confirmed a 2.5-fold lower sensitivity for the V600E mutation than the wild type enzyme. These data appear to separate pazopanib from previously described B-Raf inhibitors (24)(33?34), and suggest that it may have distinct preclinical and clinical activity. Further biological and biochemical analyses of the B-Raf mutational spectrum sensitive to pazopanib inhibition is ongoing using primary tumor xenografts 7. Combined with previous data indicating an inhibitory effect of pazopanib on C-Raf (25), our data indicate that this drug is a pan-Raf inhibitor. The inter-relationship of B- and C-Raf is complex. Dumaz et al. reported that when Ras is mutated in melanoma cell lines, the cells stop signaling through B-Raf and switch their signaling to C-Raf to activate the MEK/ERK pathway (38). The potential importance of B-Raf to the ERK pathway in 231-BR cells was demonstrated by siRNA knockdown of B-Raf. A potent inhibition of ERK was observed, with no effect on C-Raf expression. These data may appear in contradiction with Dumaz et al. (38), but can be potentially explained by the fact that the 231-BR cell line harbors both a mutant Ras and a mutant B-Raf. B-Raf may become the main mediator downstream of mutant Ras, rather than C-Raf. Similarly, siRNA knockdown of B-Raf in MCF7 cells, where a wild type B-Raf was activated by HER2 transfection, also showed a significant role for B-Raf in ERK regulation. These data confirm the significance of B-Raf in a more prevalent scenario. It will be of interest to determine whether B-Raf activation by other upstream oncogenic events is also sensitive to pazopanib inhibition. Brain metastases of breast cancer appear to be increasing in incidence and threaten to limit the gains made by systemic chemotherapy. Using the 231-BR-HER2 model, pazopanib prevented the formation of micrometastases by 25?39% and the formation of large metastases by 51?73%. We report the development of a new experimental brain metastasis model using the estrogen receptor+ MCF7 cell line transfected with HER2. After three rounds of brain passage, the MCF7-HER2-BR3 line produced one large brain metastasis in approximately 70% of mice 6 weeks post-injection. Pazopanib reduced the size of the brain metastases by 55% (p=0.067). More control than pazopanib treated mice were eliminated from MRI analysis as they required sacrifice before the end of the experiments; histological analyses of the brains at necropsy revealed large metastases in all mice (data not shown). Inclusion of these mice in the MRI analysis may have improved the efficacy of pazopanib over that reported. The data suggest a role for pazopanib in the prevention of HER2+ brain metastatic colonization which could be tested in the metastatic setting or in the time to the development of a new metastasis in brain metastatic patients treated with drug. Future studies will investigate rational combinations of HER2 therapeutics such as lapatinib and pazopanib for the prevention and treatment of brain metastasis. We are attempting to derive brain metastatic sublines of naturally occurring HER2+ breast cancer cell lines for these studies. Given the multiplicity of activities of pazopanib, we attempted to determine the relative contribution of anti-angiogenesis versus Raf inhibitory activity in the experimental brain metastasis assays. The role of angiogenesis in metastasis has been controversial generally and in the brain (11, 14?15, 39?42). In the 231-BR-HER2 model, brain metastasis development per se resulted in vascular remodeling. Lower vessel densities and higher percentages of brain area covered by vessels corresponded to fewer but dilated vessels, in agreement with previous reports (14). In the MCF7-HER2-BR3 model, higher percentages of brain area covered by vessels were also observed. However, no effect of pazopanib at either dose tested was found on these parameters in both models. It remains possible that other aspects of vascular permeability and remodeling may be affected in the brain, and that pazopanib may exert anti-angiogenic responses in other organ sites of metastasis. In contrast, a significant decrease in pMEK1/2 and pERK1/2 staining was observed in pazopanib treated 231-BR-HER2 brain metastases, confirming the in vivo modulation of Raf activity. For technical reasons, pMEK1/2 and pERK1/2 staining could not be performed on the MCF7-HER2-BR3 model. Indeed, each brain was bisected along the saggittal plane and each hemisphere fixed differently for the various analyses presented herein. Unfortunately, it turned out that the metastases favored one hemisphere, leaving inadequate amounts of metastatic tissue for the pMEK1/2 and pERK1/2 staining. Characterization of the signaling pathways altered by pazopanib in MCF7-HER2 mammary fat pad xenografts in vivo is ongoing; results to date showed a significant decrease in pERK1/2 after pazopanib treatement 7. The data indicate that the recently discovered B-Raf inhibitory activity of pazopanib is active in vivo, and may be of preventive significance. These data may permit new clinical trials to be developed and rational combinations tested. Statement of translational relevance. Brain metastases occur in ~35% of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer patients. Many patients now develop brain metastases as a first site of progression with stable systemic disease and, increasingly, brain metastases contribute to patient death. We report that pazopanib, an approved inhibitor of VEGFRs, PDGFRs and c-kit, reduced brain metastatic colonization in two experimental breast cancer models overexpressing the HER2 oncogene. In vitro studies using 231-BR cells revealed an unexpected diminution of tumor ERK activation despite the presence of both Ras and B-Raf mutations; enzymatic assays confirmed a new function for pazopanib as a B-Raf inhibitor. In the 231-BR-HER2 model, reduced brain metastasis formation was accompanied by reduced pERK but no change in vessel density. The data suggest pazopanib as a candidate for brain metastasis prevention. The data also identify a new activity for this drug which may enable new rational combinations. Supplementary Material. 1.

                "text": "Knockdown of Oncogenic KRAS in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers Suppresses Tumor Growth and Sensitizes Tumor Cells to Targeted Therapy\tOncogenic KRAS is found in >25% of lung adenocarcinomas, the major histologic subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and is an important target for drug development. To this end, we generated four NSCLC lines with stable knockdown selective for oncogenic KRAS. As expected, stable knockdown of oncogenic KRAS led to inhibition of in vitro and in vivo tumor growth in the KRAS mutant NSCLC cells, but not in NSCLC cells that have wild-type KRAS (but mutant NRAS). Surprisingly, we did not see large-scale induction of cell death and the growth inhibitory effect was not complete. To further understand the ability of NSCLCs to grow despite selective removal of mutant KRAS expression, we performed microarray expression profiling of NSCLC cell lines with or without mutant KRAS knockdown and isogenic human bronchial epithelial cell lines (HBECs) with and without oncogenic KRAS. We found that while the MAPK pathway is significantly down-regulated after mutant KRAS knockdown, these NSCLCs showed increased levels of phospho-STAT3 and phospho-EGFR, and variable changes in phospho-Akt. In addition, mutant KRAS knockdown sensitized the NSCLCs to p38 and EGFR inhibitors. Our findings suggest that targeting oncogenic KRAS by itself will not be sufficient treatment but may offer possibilities of combining anti-KRAS strategies with other targeted drugs. Introduction. The development of NSCLC is a multi-step process involving a number of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities acquired over time (1). Based on the recent successes of molecularly targeted therapy in some cancers, many of these genetic and epigenetic lesions may represent potential therapeutic targets for NSCLC (2, 3). The proto-oncogene KRAS is one of the most important of these potential targets because its mutation is common in many cancers and it sits at the apex of multiple growth regulatory cascades (4, 5). KRAS encodes a small GTP-binding protein that is involved in many cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (4). Wild-type KRAS has intrinsic GTPase activity, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP thereby inactivating the RAS growth-promoting signal, while oncogenic KRAS is locked into the GTP-bound state, leading to constitutive RAS signaling. KRAS mutations are detected in >25% of lung adenocarcinomas (6), 85% of which affect codon 12 (1), and these mutations are associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients (7). Thus, oncogenic mutations of KRAS play an important role in the development of NSCLC. Although several strategies to inhibit KRAS including farnesyltransferase inhibitors have been explored, these approaches tend not to be specific for the mutant form of KRAS and so lead to inhibition of wild-type KRAS activity, which is essential for normal growth and development (8, 9). The relative failure of KRAS inhibitors in cancer clinical trials likely derives from specificity issues as well as from differences in how mutant KRAS controls its downstream effectors in different individual tumors. In this study, we use an RNA interference (RNAi) based approach specifically targeting mutant KRAS mRNA to investigate how loss of oncogenic KRAS signaling affects the malignant phenotype of NSCLCs. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of gene expression profiling analysis along with RNAi technology to uncover oncogenic KRAS-specific gene signatures in lung cancers and other types of cancers (10, 11). In this study, we used a new approach to uncover oncogenic KRAS-specific gene signatures by microarray gene expression profiling with RNAi-mediated mutant-specific KRAS knockdown in NSCLC cells and mutant KRAS-transformed bronchial epithelial cells. Overall, our results show that KRAS mutation has canonical MAPK-dependent effects on cell proliferation and the malignant phenotype in NSCLC, but that among different NSCLCs mutant KRAS can lead to different outputs in cellular signaling that affect cell survival. Our findings suggest that by itself, oncogenic KRAS is not an \u00a1\u00aeAchilles heal\u00a1\u00af of NSCLC and that treatment of NSCLCs with KRAS mutations will require knowledge of other tumor molecular abnormalities, which in turn provide additional targeted therapy opportunities for KRAS mutation-positive NSCLC patients. Materials and Methods. Cell lines. Five NSCLC cell lines, NCI-H23, H1792, H358, H441 and H1299 and four HBEC lines were obtained from the Hamon Center collection (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). All lines were genotyped by STR analysis in accordance with AACR best practices. HBEC3 cells were established by retroviral-transfection with CDK4 and the catalytic component of telomerase (hTERT) and four variants of an isogenic series of HBECs were used in this study: HBEC3, HBEC3/mutant KRAS (HBEC3K), HBEC3/shRNA targeting p53 (HBEC3p53), and HBEC3/mutant KRAS/shRNA targeting p53 (HBEC3K53) (12). Characteristics of these cell lines are summarized in Table 1 (13?18). Cancer cells were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. HBEC3 and its derivatives were cultured with Keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) medium with 50 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen) and 5 ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen). Construction and use of retroviral vectors. To provide specific oncogenic KRAS knockdown, retroviral vectors producing shRNA against mutant KRAS were constructed by inserting annealed 64-mer sense and antisense oligos into pSUPER.retro (pRS) (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) as described (19). The 64-mer oligos were as follows: pRS-KRAS-V12, 5\u00a1\u00c7-gatccccGTTGGAGCTGTTGGCGTAGttcaagagaCTACGCCAACAGCTCCAACtttttggaaa-3\u00a1\u00c7 (sense) and 5\u00a1\u00c7-agcttttccaaaaaGTTGGAGCTGTTGGCGTAGtctcttgaaCTACGCCAACAGCTCCAACggg-3\u00a1\u00c7 (anti-sense); pRS-KRAS-C12, 5\u00a1\u00c7-gatccccGTTGGAGCTTGTGGCGTAGttcaagagaCTACGCCACAAGCTCCAACtttttggaaa-3\u00a1\u00c7 (sense) and 5\u00a1\u00c7-agcttttccaaaaaGTTGGAGCTTGTGGCGTAGtctcttgaaCTACGCCACAAGCTCCAACggg-3\u00a1\u00c7 (anti-sense). The sequences targeting the mutation in KRAS are indicated in capitals in the oligonucleotide sequences. Cells were infected with retroviral vectors (12). Briefly, the pRS vector was co-transfected with pVPack-GP and pVPackVSV-G vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) into 293T cells by using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturers\u00a1\u00af protocol. After 48 h, the culture medium was filtered through a 0.45 \u00a5\u00ecm filter to obtain retroviral supernatants. Cells were then infected with the retroviral supernatants and 4 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml polybrene, and after 10 h, supernatants were removed and cells were grown with complete growth medium for an additional 24 h. Infected cells were then selected with 1 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml puromycin. After seven days of puromycin selection, cells were used for analyses. Transfection of synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA). siRNAs targeting against the KRAS mutations were designed and purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The siRNA sequences were 5\u00a1\u00c7-GUUGGAGCUUGUGGCGUAGTT-3\u00a1\u00c7 (sense) and 5\u00a1\u00c7-CUACGCCACCAGCUCCAACTT-3\u00a1\u00c7 (anti-sense) for the KRAS G12C mutation, and 5\u00a1\u00c7-GUUGGAGCUGUUGGCGUAGTT-3\u00a1\u00c7 (sense) and 5\u00a1\u00c7-CUACGCCAACAGCUCCAACTT-3\u00a1\u00c7 (antisense) for the KRAS G12V mutation. siRNAs were transfected into cells using Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described (20). Three days after the transfection, cells were harvested for analysis. Western Blot analysis. Western Blot was performed using whole cell lysates, separated on SDS/polyacrylamine gel, and electro-blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) as described (20). The membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-KRAS (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-Actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), rabbit polyclonal anti-MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti?extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt (Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt (Thr308; Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 3 (Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705; Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; Cell Signaling) and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068; Cell Signaling) antibodies. The membranes were developed with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) by Super Signal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Actin protein levels were used as a control for adequacy of equal protein loading. Protein expression levels were quantified by densitometry analysis. RT-PCR and Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. To detect transcripts of wild-type or mutant KRAS, PCR-RFLP method was performed as described (12, 21). Total RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and cDNA was synthesized using 2 \u00a5\u00ecg of total RNA with the SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis using oligo (dT) primer System (Invitrogen). Aliquots of the reaction mixture were used for the subsequent PCR amplification. The primer sequences for KRAS amplification were 5\u00a1\u00c7-GACTGAATATAAACTTGTGGTAGTTGGACCT-3\u00a1\u00c7 (sense) and 5\u00a1\u00c7-TCCTCTTGACCTGCTGTGTCG-3\u00a1\u00c7 (antisense). The sense primer was designed to introduce a base substitution that created a BstNI recognition site for the wild-type codon 12 (GGT) but not for the codon 12 with the KRAS mutation. PCR conditions were as follows: a reaction volume of 40 \u00a5\u00ecl for 15 min at 95\u00a1\u00c6C for initial denaturation, followed by 25 cycles of 30 sec at 95\u00a1\u00c6C, 60 sec at 55 \u00a1\u00c6C, 30 sec at 72\u00a1\u00c6C, and a final extension at 72 \u00a1\u00c6C for 10 min. PCR products (15ml) were digested with 30 units of BstNI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 60 \u00a1\u00c6C for 3 h, and were visualized on 3% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. KRAS copy number analysis. KRAS copy number was analyzed as described (22). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed using the Chromo4 PCR System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). We evaluated KRAS copy number in each sample by comparing the KRAS locus to the reference LINE-1, a repetitive element for which copy numbers per haploid genome are similar among all of the human normal and neoplastic cells (23). In vivo xenograft growth. In vivo tumor growth was examined by injecting cells into nu/nu nude mice. 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells infected with pRS-KRAS-C12 or pRS control vector were injected into nude mice subcutaneously. Five mice were injected for each treatment. Tumor volume was measured for 70 days and 21 days for H358 cells and H1299 cells, respectively. RNA quality and microarray analysis. The quality of total RNA was analyzed by formaldehyde gel and/or by capillary electrophoresis on the Experion System (Bio-Rad). Total RNA was labeled and amplified by our genomics core facility according to manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions (24). cRNA was re-analyzed after labeling to ensure optimal amplification. cRNA was hybridized to U133 Plus 2.0 (~47000 transcripts) (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and scanned by our microarray core facility (25). Array analysis was performed as described (26). Briefly, after scanning, arrays were checked for quality using GCOS and then normalized using RMA. After normalization all the data were compiled using R and BRB ArrayTools (developed by Dr. Richard Simon and BRB-ArrayTools Development Team). Class comparisons were made using BRB ArrayTools. Bioinformatics were performed using NIH-DAVID (27) and BRB ArrayTools. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The expression of the DUSP6 and NT5E genes was examined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR as described (28). Primers and probes for each gene were purchased from Applied Biosystems. For the quantitative analysis, the TBP gene was used as an internal reference gene to normalize input cDNA. PCR was performed in a reaction volume of 20 \u00a5\u00ecl, including 2 \u00a5\u00ecl cDNA using the Gene Amp 7700 Sequence Detection System and software (Applied Biosystems). The comparative Ct method was used to compute relative expression values. Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 software program for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Correlations between groups were analyzed by Pearson\u00a1\u00afs correlation coefficient. Differences between groups were analyzed by ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test. Differences in tumor growth in nude mice were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. P<0.05 was considered to be significant. Results. Stable knockdown of oncogenic KRAS by retrovirus-mediated shRNA in NSCLC cell lines. We used four NSCLC cell lines H23, H1792, H358, and H441, which harbor heterozygous KRAS mutations at codon 12, and the H1299 NSCLC cell line with wild-type KRAS (but mutant NRAS) as a control (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). We used the H1299 cell line, which has an NRAS mutation at codon 61 (15) as a control for the phenotypic effects of mutant KRAS knockdown. The KRAS mutation-positive NSCLC lines exhibited different levels of KRAS protein expression (Fig. 1A), which were positively correlated with KRAS copy number in the NSCLC lines (Fig. 1B). To examine the effects of loss of oncogenic KRAS on NSCLC, we used a retroviral shRNA strategy to obtain stable and specific knockdown of mutant KRAS by pRS-KRAS-C12 targeting the KRAS G12C mutation and pRS-KRAS-V12 targeting the KRAS G12V mutation. This system has the advantage that the shRNA vectors can silence expression of mutant KRAS but retain expression of wild-type KRAS, which is indispensable for viability of normal cells (8, 9), in the four NSCLC cell lines with heterozygous KRAS mutation. H23, H1792 and H358 cells were infected with the pRS-KRAS-C12 vector and H441 cells were infected with the pRS-KRAS-V12 vector, and selected with puromycin to generate mutant KRAS-knockdown derivatives of these cell lines. H1299 cells with wild-type KRAS were infected with pRS-KRAS-C12 or pRS-KRAS-V12 to generate experimental controls. All cell lines were also infected with the pRS non-targeting control vector to generate pRS-infected control cells. In the KRAS mutant cell lines, KRAS protein expression was reduced in pRS-KRAS-infected cells compared with parental or pRS control vector-infected cells, whereas the infection with pRS, pRS-KRAS-C12 or pRS-KRAS-V12 did not affect KRAS protein expression in H1299 cells with wild-type KRAS (Fig. 1C). Thus, using the mutant-specific shRNA vector systems, we were able to isolate clones with stable loss of oncogenic KRAS expression in these NSCLC cell lines. Since there are no commercially available mutant specific KRAS antibodies, we used PCR-RFLP analysis in order to verify that our RNAi strategy was specific for only mutant KRAS. In KRAS mutant NSCLC cells (H23, H1792, H358 and H441), the mutant 186-bp band was detected with higher intensity compared to the wild-type 156-bp cDNA fragment (Fig. 1D), demonstrating that cells with KRAS mutations express more mutant KRAS transcripts than wild-type, as previously reported by us (12) and others (29). In the KRAS-disrupted clones of H23, H1792, H358 and H441 cells, the intensity of the uncut bands was reduced compared to those in parental cells or in the control vector-infected cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, in our hands, retroviral-mediated RNAi substantially depleted expression of mutant KRAS mRNA but not wild-type KRAS mRNA (19). shRNA-mediated knockdown of mutant KRAS suppresses in vitro and in vivo growth of NSCLC cell lines. Next we assessed the effect of shRNA-mediated stable knockdown of mutant KRAS expression on cell proliferation by the MTT assay. shRNA-mediated knockdown of mutant KRAS inhibited cell proliferation in all of the KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines but not in H1299, whereas cell proliferation was not affected by the control vector in all cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 2A). The effect of KRAS knockdown on anchorage-independent growth was also assessed by soft-agar colony formation assay. KRAS knockdown led to a marked decrease (\u00a1\u00c375%) in colony numbers in the KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines but not in H1299 compared to the colony numbers of the parental cells (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Thus, shRNA-mediated knockdown of mutant KRAS significantly inhibited in vitro cell growth of KRAS mutation-positive NSCLC cells. To further evaluate the effects of reduced mutant KRAS expression on the tumorigenic phenotype, and in particular its contribution to in vivo tumor growth, we used the H358 cell line since this cell line consistently produces tumors in nude mice (30) and the effects of KRAS knockdown on in vitro growth inhibition was most prominent among four KRAS mutant NSCLC lines (Supplementary Fig. 2A, 2B), indicating that H358 cells appears to be dependent on oncogenic KRAS signaling. There was a significant difference in in vivo tumor growth between H358 cells with pRS-KRAS-C12 and those with the control vectors (Supplementary Fig. 2C). H1299 cells infected with pRS-KRAS-C12or the control vector were also injected into mice to verifywhether there were any off-target effects of the pRS-KRAS-C12 infection that might inadvertently suppress tumor growth. In fact, the pRS-KRAS-C12 positive H1299 cells grew better than the vector controls, although this difference was not significant (Supplementary Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that in vivo tumor growth was partially inhibited by shRNA-mediated knockdown of mutant KRAS expression in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells. Effects of mutant KRAS knockdown on expression profiles in NSCLC cell lines. KRAS sits at the hub of multiple signaling cascades and activating mutations of KRAS can lead to diverse aberrant signal transduction events. As a first step to elucidate how oncogenic KRAS affects downstream pathways and to discover what might account for the residual tumorigenicity observed after KRAS knockdown, we performed microarray expression profiling (Affymetrix HG-U133-Plus2 array) of NSCLCs with and without oncogenic KRAS, and compared the expression profiles. As a control, we profiled H1299 cells (wild-type KRAS) after infection with the two vectors. Importantly, there were almost no differences in gene expression in H1299 with either vector (Supplementary Fig 3A). Within the mutant KRAS NSCLC cell lines, microarray analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity in genes whose expression changed more than two-fold with knockdown of oncogenic KRAS (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Thus, while knockdown of oncogenic KRAS has a clear and consistent effect on cell growth in NSCLC, there is significant diversity in its effect at the level of gene transcription. Recently, Sweet-Cordero et al. attempted to identify an oncogenic KRAS-specific gene expression signature in NSCLC using cell lines and primary tumors (11). However, due to the heterogeneity of the KRAS expression phenotype in NSCLC, they employed a KRAS mouse model to identify a robust signature. In our study, we used an isogenic series of HBECs (HBEC3, HBEC3-K, HBEC3-p53 and HBEC3-p53K) that contain various oncogenic changes including forced expression of mutant KRAS-V12 (K) and shRNA dependent knockdown of p53 (p53) for similar purposes (Supplementary Fig. 4A) (12). When NSCLC cell lines and HBECs were grouped according to whether they expressed mutant KRAS (H23-vector, H1792-vector, H358-vector, H441-vector, HBEC3-K and HBEC3-p53K) or not (H23-KRAS knockdown [KD], H1792-KRAS [KD], H358-KRAS [KD] H441-KRAS [KD], HBEC3, and HBEC3-p53) (Table 1), we identified 53 unique (several of which were poorly annotated) genes that distinguished these groups in a statistically significant manner (Supplementary Fig. 4B; Supplementary Table 1). Among these genes, two genes, ecto-5\u00a1\u00c7-nucleotidase (NT5E, also known as CD73) and dual specificity phosphatase6 (DUSP6, also known as MKP-3), were identified as significantly down-regulated genes. While relationship between Ras and NT5E remains unknown, recent studies by us and others have elucidated that DUSP6 is up-regulated through ERK- MAPK signaling pathway upon oncogenic activation of EGFR (12, 31) or Ras (32), and controls the pathway as a negative feedback mediator (31). The reproducibility of transcriptional regulation of DUSP6 and NT5E was validated bytransient knockdown of mutant KRAS by synthetic siRNAs. siRNAs targeting against mutant KRAS were transfected into H23, H1792, H358 and H441 cells and expression levels of NT5E and DUSP6 were examined at three days post-transfection by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Log ratios of mRNA expression changes by siRNA mediated KRAS knockdown were significantly correlated with those by the retroviral shRNA mediated-knockdown in the four NSCLC lines (Supplementary Fig. 4C), confirming that the expression of DUSP6 or NT5E expression was down-regulated by mutant KRAS knockdown. Functional annotation analysis of the 53 genes revealed that many of these genes fell into the MAPK cascade as both positive and negative regulators of cell proliferation and survival (Supplementary Table 2). Importantly, we found that three dual specificity phosphatase activities (DUSP-4, -5, and -6) were down-regulated, and TGF\u00a5\u00e2 an important activating ligand for SMAD/p38 signaling was up-regulated by oncogenic KRAS knockdown (Supplementary Table 3). These data suggest that the cells responded to loss of oncogenic KRAS signaling by reducing levels of negative feedback MAPK regulators and up-regulating autocrine signals to establish compensatory pro-growth stimuli through alternative, but related signal transduction cascades. In addition, a comparison of the gene expression changes between HBEC cells with ectopic oncogenic KRAS and the NSCLC knockdown experiments suggest that the early effectors of mutant-RAS dependent signaling are similar between cell lines (underscored by the fact that nearly all members of each group either over-expressed on under expressed each of the 53 genes). Effects of mutant KRAS knockdown on phosphoproteins in EGFR and RAS pathways in KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines. The principal finding of our array analysis was that genes involved in MAPK regulation were transcriptionally altered by oncogenic KRAS. While this is not surprising, we decided to further explore these changes at the protein level since many components of this pathway regulate protein phosphorylation. Before knockdown, it should be noted that the levels of KRAS protein expression varied among the KRAS mutation-positive NSCLC cell lines (Fig. 1A). The effects of KRAS knockdown on phosphorylation levels of MEK, ERK, AKT and EGFR protein are summarized (Fig. 2A, 2B). Consistent with our array analysis, KRAS knockdown reduced the levels of pMEK and pERK in all cell lines. Conversely, pEGFR levels were up-regulated in all cell lines after KRAS knockdown. Of note, the effects of KRAS knockdown on pAKT levels were different among these four lines. We also examined the effects of KRAS knockdown on the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 since it is an important downstream mediator of the EGFR signaling. STAT3 is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, acting as a transcription factor to regulate gene expression (33), and the phosphorylation is mediated by oncogenic activation of EGFR in NSCLC cells (34). We found that pSTAT3 levels were up-regulated by KRAS knockdown in all cell lines, which appears to be a result from EGFR phosphorylation induced by KRAS knockdown. These results indicate that oncogenic KRAS positively regulates the MEK-ERK activation but negatively regulates activation of STAT3 and EGFR. On the other hand, AKT activation is differentially regulated by oncogenic KRAS among NSCLC cells carrying KRAS mutations. Our data, along with those recently reported by Singh et al., reflect the complexities of oncogenic KRAS-induced regulation of downstream pathways and led us to consider the possibility that oncogenic KRAS by itself does not explain all of the activity driving oncogenesis through the MAPK pathway in established tumors (10). The synergistic effect of p38 and EGFR inhibitors with KRAS knockdown on cell growth of NSCLC. To be able to tolerate the \u00a1\u00b0stress\u00a1\u00b1 of oncogenic KRAS expression, lung epithelial cells likely require secondary changes to adapt to their altered signaling homeostasis. Based on our finding that different NSCLCs responded differently to knockdown of oncogenic KRAS in terms of mRNA expression profile and MAPK-related signal transduction, we hypothesized that each of these lines had acquired different secondary changes potentially in KRAS controlled signaling pathways and/or, through some feedback mechanism to compensate for loss of oncogenic KRAS. Based on these considerations and the western blot data, we considered whether NSCLCs in which oncogenic KRAS was targeted (in our case with stable knockdown) acquired sensitivity to other targeted therapies. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of inhibitors to MEK1/2 (U0126), p38 (p38 V), PI3K (LY294002), AKT 1/2 (Akt VIII), EGFR tyrosine kinase (gefitinib) and an anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab) on cell growth of KRAS mutant NSCLC cells. The treatment of p38 V in combination with KRAS knockdown resulted in significant growth inhibition in H23 at \u00a1\u00c32.5 \u00a5\u00ecM, in H1792 at \u00a1\u00c30.025 \u00a5\u00ecM, and in H441 at 2.5 \u00a5\u00ecM compared to control treatments of p38 in the parental cells without KRAS knockdown (Fig. 3A). Thus, KRAS knockdown enhanced sensitivity to the p38 inhibitor markedly in H1792 and less so in H23 and H441. The treatment of gefitinib with KRAS knockdown resulted in significant growth inhibition in H23 at 10 \u00a5\u00ecM, in H1792 at 0.1 to 10 \u00a5\u00ecM, and in H358 at 0.01 to 1 \u00a5\u00ecM compared to the treatment of gefitinib without KRAS knockdown (Fig. 3B). Also, the treatment of cetuximab with KRAS knockdown resulted in significant growth inhibition in H1792 at \u00a1\u00c30.5 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml (Fig. 3C). Thus, KRAS knockdown significantly enhanced sensitivity to gefitinib in H23, H1792 and H358 and cetuximab in H1792, although the effects of sensitization were modest in some cases. In contrast, KRAS knockdown did not significantly affect the sensitivity to U1026, LY294002 and Akt VIII in these NSCLC lines (data not shown). These results suggest that inhibitors of EGFR and p38 could be effective for treatment of KRAS mutation-positive NSCLC in combination with KRAS knockdown. Discussion. In this report, we used shRNA methodology to stably silence the expression of oncogenic KRAS in four NSCLC cell lines. We found that stable knockdown of oncogenic KRAS led to reduced proliferation rates and anchorage independent growth in vitro, as well as decreased in vivo tumorigenicity. However, we found that knockdown of oncogenic KRAS did not lead to apoptosis or complete loss of tumorigenicity, which is in contrast to previously reported results in the pancreatic cancer cell line CAPAN-1 carrying homozygous KRAS mutations. (19). One possible explanation on differences between their study and ours is that NSCLC cell lines used in our study carry both mutant and wild-type KRAS alleles. Hence, the mutant-specific KRAS shRNA vectors will not affect wild-type KRAS expression, which appears to be indispensable for cell viability under normal conditions. While it is possible that the lack of complete loss of cell viability by mutant KRAS knockdown would not be significant due to the remaining wild-type KRAS, it is also possible that retained expression of wild-type KRAS in the oncogenic KRAS-disrupted clone permits survival of the NSCLC cells through normal regulation of signal transduction. Of note, Brummelkamp et al. also reported that oncogenic KRAS knockdown had no significant effect on the ability of CAPAN-1 cells to proliferate adherently. Thus, it is also possible that knocking down oncogenic KRAS does not have striking effects on cell proliferation in contrast to the effects on anchorage-independent growth. Analysis of the transcriptional changes associated with knockdown of oncogenic KRAS suggest that the cells responded by down-regulating negative regulators of MAPK, in particular those of ERK 1/2 and JNK, as well as by up-regulating Ras related GTPases and ligands for EGFR and SMAD. The biological relevance of down-regulating phosphatase activity and up-regulating autocrine ligands demonstrates the adaptabilityof NSCLCs of finding alternative signal transduction cascades ? through MAPK-related pathways ? to re-establish oncogenic signaling. Most importantly, we show that mutant KRAS knockdown in these NSCLCs led to sensitization to molecularly targeted therapeutics: inhibitors of EGFR and p38, especially for H1792 cells, although the effect of KRAS knockdown was modest and required high concentrations of these inhibitors in some cases. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that loss of oncogenic KRAS activity leads to up-regulation of phospho-EGFR and sensitizes formerly resistant NSCLCs to inhibitors of EGFR. In NSCLC, mutations in the EGFR and KRAS genes are major molecular abnormalities that appear to be mutually exclusive (5, 35). Thus, it will be essential to develop therapeutic modalities for NSCLC carrying either EGFR or KRAS mutations. While EGFR-TKI therapy is effective in EGFR mutation-positive patients (36?39), they provide no benefit for KRAS mutant lung cancer (40). Currently, there are no effective treatment strategies for KRAS mutant NSCLC. In our study, shRNA-mediated knockdown of mutant KRAS in NSCLCs led to up-regulation of pEGFR and significantly increased sensitivity to gefitinib. Our findings may explain, at least in part, why NSCLCs with KRAS mutations are resistant to EGFR-TKIs: oncogenic activation of KRAS obviates the need for signaling via ligand-dependent activation and phosphorylation of EGFR. However, our data also demonstrate that NSCLCs, which probably evolved through a KRAS?dependent process, retain the capacity to up-regulate other signals, which feed through MAPK. This conclusion is supported by a recent study showing that exogenous expression of mutant KRAS in human bronchial epithelial cells reduced the phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of EGFR in the phosphoproteomic studies (41). The present study indicates, as expected, that activation of the MAPK pathway is a critical event in the initiation of KRAS mutant NSCLC while additional molecular abnormalities resulting in deregulation of other signaling pathways such as the PI3K-Akt pathway could play a role in the maintenance of the oncogenic phenotype. These findings suggest that multiple molecular targets exist for combination therapy in NSCLC patients carrying KRAS mutations. Our results show that inhibiting oncogenic KRAS activity alone is not sufficient to completely inhibit tumor growth of KRAS mutant NSCLC. By applying the results from four NSCLC cell lines carrying additional distinct molecular abnormalities to a broader genetic analysis of KRAS mutation-positive patients, it might be possible to identify the critical molecules to target in combination with mutant KRAS knockdown to improve treatment for patients. We found that mutant KRAS knockdown enhanced sensitivity to the p38 inhibitor p38V in NSCLC cells. This unexpected result might be due to autocrine up-regulation of TGF\u00a5\u00e2, which was significantly up-regulated after knockdown of oncogenic KRAS (Supplementary Table 3; Supplementary Fig. 4B), as well as crosstalk between ERK and p38. p38 is involved in many cellular processes including cell proliferation and apoptosis in response to stress stimuli and cytokines. Although the role of p38 in tumor development is not as well-defined as ERK, recent evidence suggests that the two pathways, ERK and p38, play opposing roles in tumor cells (42). It is possible that p38 signaling substitutes for deactivation of ERK signaling caused by loss of mutant KRAS; thus dual inhibition of KRAS and p38 activities could be effective for the treatment of KRAS mutation-positive NSCLC. Recent advances in molecular biology have made considerable progress in molecularly targeted cancer therapy. A number of molecularly targeted drugs are clinically available or being tested for clinical use in lung cancer based on the growing knowledge of the molecular abnormalities relevant to lung carcinogenesis (3). Considering that KRAS mutations are observed >25% of lung adenocarcinomas (6), therapeutic strategies targeting oncogenic KRAS and its signaling pathway would be very valuable in treating NSCLCs with activating KRAS mutations. The present study suggests that targeting oncogenic KRAS alone does not seem to be \u00a1\u00aeAchilles heel\u00a1\u00af of mutant KRAS NSCLC. Recently, several studies using genome-wide RNAi screen with human cancer cell lines have identified potential molecular targets that are synthetically lethal with oncogenic KRAS, including PLK1 (43), TBK1 (44) and STK33 (45). While these molecules are potential targets in NSCLC cells with KRAS mutations, the synthetic lethal interactions are influenced by their oncogenic KRAS dependency; thus, the extent of the \u00a1\u00b0synthetic lethality\u00a1\u00b1 appears to be cell type-dependent. For instance, Singh et al. found that only some KRAS mutant cells retained a requirement for this oncogene (10), which led the authors to stratify KRAS mutant tumors into two broad subgroups: dependent or independent of sustained mutant KRAS signaling. Added to this, other studies reported dependent but not independent KRAS mutant tumors are sensitive to suppression of STK33 (45) and TBK1 (44). Our findings, together with other recent reports, do point to the fact that mutant KRAS oncogenic signaling is likely more complex than previously perceived. Tumor cells might be more robust than we thought in that they can have versatile mechanisms to overcome \u00a1\u00b0targeted inhibition\u00a1\u00b1 and that even knocking down mutant KRAS itself does not seem to be an effective Achilles heel. The observance of these diverse subsets of KRAS mutant NSCLCs ? with distinct molecular profiles, signaling pathway activation, drug sensitivity, epithelial-to-mesenchymal status, and molecular aberrations ? supports what we envision as a more effective treatment strategy for KRAS mutant NSCLCs: the combined targeting of oncogenic KRAS in addition with other therapeutic agents specific to the molecular profile of the tumor. Thus, the treatment of KRAS mutation-positive NSCLC patients will require a priori knowledge of other molecular abnormalities in the tumors in order to achieve more effective therapies for NSCLC. Further studies focusing on the cells\u00a1\u00af compensatory mechanisms could also be quite fruitful. Supplementary Material. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Targeting BRAF V600E with PLX4720 Displays Potent Antimigratory and Anti-invasive Activity in Preclinical Models of Human Thyroid Cancer\tPurpose.. B-Raf V600E may play a role in the progression from papillary thyroid cancer to anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). We tested the effects of a highly selective B-Raf V600E inhibitor, PLX4720, on proliferation, migration, and invasion both in human thyroid cancer cell lines (8505c B-RafV600E and TPC-1 RET/PTC-1 and wild-type B-Raf) and in primary human normal thyroid (NT) follicular cells engineered with or without B-Raf V600E. Experimental Design.. Large-scale genotyping analysis by mass spectrometry was performed in order to analyze >900 gene mutations. Cell proliferation and migration/invasion were performed upon PLX4720 treatment in 8505c, TPC-1, and NT cells. Orthotopic implantation of either 8505c or TPC-1 cells into the thyroid of severe combined immunodeficient mice was performed. Gene validations were performed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Results.. We found that PLX4720 reduced in vitro cell proliferation and migration and invasion of 8505c cells, causing early downregulation of genes involved in tumor progression. PLX4720-treated NT cells overexpressing B-Raf V600E (heterozygous wild-type B-Raf/B-Raf V600E) showed significantly lower cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. PLX4720 treatment did not block cell invasion in TPC-1 cells with wild-type B-Raf, which showed very low and delayed in vivo tumor growth. In vivo, PLX4720 treatment of 8505c orthotopic thyroid tumors inhibited tumor aggressiveness and significantly upregulated the thyroid differentiation markers thyroid transcription factor 1 and paired box gene 8. Conclusions.. Here, we have shown that PLX4720 preferentially inhibits migration and invasion of B-Raf V600E thyroid cancer cells and tumor aggressiveness. Normal thyroid cells were generated to be heterozygous for wild-type B-Raf/B-Raf V600E, mimicking the condition found in most human thyroid cancers. PLX4720 was effective in reducing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in this heterozygous model. PLX4720 therapy should be tested and considered for a phase I study for the treatment of patients with B-Raf V600E ATC. Introduction. The incidence of well-differentiated thyroid cancers has been increasing [1]. The majority of patients with these tumors have a low risk for recurrence or death with standard therapy (surgery, radioiodine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] suppression). However, a subset of patients with aggressive thyroid cancer, especially anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), present with locally advanced disease that recurs and metastasizes [2]. Mutations in key regulatory genes are likely to play an important role. Mutations known to be important in papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) include: RET/PTC translocation (10%?50% of PTCs) [3, 4], Ras mutations (about 12% of PTCs) [5], and B-Raf V600E mutations (29%?83% of PTCs) [6, 7]. B-Raf V600E is the second most common somatic mutation in human cancer, with a frequency of approximately 8% [8]. The B-Raf V600E protein (valine-to-glutamate, position 600) results from a transversion in the gene (T1799A) and results in increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (e.g., mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal?related kinase kinase [MEK]-1/MEK-2, extracellular signal?related kinase [ERK]-1/ERK-2) activity [8, 12]. When PTC and ATC occur together in the same thyroid malignant lesion, they generally share the B-Raf V600E mutation, implying that many ATCs are derived from malignant degeneration of pre-existing well-differentiated PTCs [13]. Our study focuses on further elucidating the role of this mutation in aggressive thyroid cancers. PLX4720 (7-azaindole derivative) is a selective small molecule inhibitor of B-Raf V600E [14]. PLX4720 was designed to block the ATP-binding site of oncogenic B-Raf V600E [14]. PLX4720 binds selectively to the active B-Raf V600E protein conformation. Consistent with the high degree of selectivity, PLX4720 inhibits B-Raf V600E kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo in melanoma and colorectal tumor cell models [14]. We performed in vitro testing of PLX4720 on human thyroid cancer cell lines harboring the B-Raf V600E mutation or the RET/PTC-1 translocation (with wild-type [wt] B-Raf in both alleles) and on primary human normal thyroid (NT) follicular cells engineered to express B-Raf V600E. We furthermore used an orthotopic mouse model of ATC harboring B-Raf V600E to test in detail the in vivo activity of PLX4720 on tumor aggressiveness using an early intervention model. Materials and Methods. Antibodies. Antibodies for Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) are reported in the supplemental online data. PLX4720 Preparation. PLX4720 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 1 \u00a5\u00ecM or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM for in vitro assays. For the in vivo preparation, PLX4720 was dissolved in DMSO (120 mg/ml) and then suspended in a 1% solution of carboxymethycellulose (Sigma, St. Louis). Human Thyroid Cancer Cell Lines and NT Cells. We used the TPC-1 cell line (human PTC, RET/PTC-1/wt for B-Raf), provided by Dr. F. Frasca (University of Catania, Catania, Italy), and the 8505c cell line (human ATC harboring B-Raf V600E), purchased from DSMZ (German collection of microorganisms and cell culture) [15]. NT cells were obtained according to Fischer et al. [16]. All in vitro assays were performed by growing these cell lines with the specific growth medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. More details are reported in the supplemental online data. Cell Transfections for Retrovirus Production. Sixty-millimeter plates of HEK 293T cells (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5) were transfected using Fugene-6 (Roche, Indianapolis) in OptiMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 48 hours. B-Raf V600E Transduction in NT Cells. B-Raf V600E-pBABE-puro and pBABE-puro (empty vector) retroviral constructs were provided by Dr. W.C. Hahn (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) [17] and used for B-Raf V600E overexpression (transduction) studies in NT cells (passage 0). For analysis, cells were pelleted then processed according to Nucera et al. [18]. More details are reported in the supplemental online data. WB Analysis. WB assays and band densitometry were performed according to a standard procedure [19]. Cell Cycle Analysis, Bromodeoxyuridine Assay, and Apoptosis Assay. 8505c, TPC-1, and NT cells were seeded at 3 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells/10-cm dish. After 72 hours of treatment with PLX4720 (1 \u00a5\u00ecM or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM) or vehicle, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 10 \u00a5\u00ecM) (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Temecula, CA) was added for 1 hour. The cell cycle analysis, BrdU assay, and apoptosis assay were performed in triplicate according to Nucera et al. [19]. Migration and Invasion Assays. Migration and invasion assays were performed in triplicate using 8505c cells (8 \u00a1\u00bf 10 3 cells/assay), TPC-1 cells (8 \u00a1\u00bf 10 3 cells/assay), and NT cells (25 \u00a1\u00bf 10 3 cells/assay) for 72 hours in culture. More details are reported in the supplemental online data. Quantitative Multigene Profiling by Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis. Quantitative multigene and absolute real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed according to Shih and Smith [20] (supplemental online data and supplemental online Table 1). Tumor Implantation. Animal work was performed in the animal facility at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) in accordance with federal, local, and institutional guidelines. Orthotopic thyroid tumor implantation was done as previously described in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) using 8505c cells (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5) engineered with green fluorescent protein (GFP) [21] or TPC-1 cells (1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6). Given our early-intervention design, 1 week post?tumor implantation mice were treated with either PLX4720 (30 mg/kg per day, n = 8) by oral gavage (Plexxikon, Berkeley, CA) or vehicle (n = 8) once daily for 21 days. Weight was recorded weekly. Tumor burden was evaluated weekly by palpation, and mice underwent necropsy 35 days after tumor implantation. Tumor size was measured using an electronic caliper. Tumor volume was calculated as (1/2) \u00a1\u00bf length \u00a1\u00bf width \u00a1\u00bf height. Tumors, regional lymph nodes, and lungs were also analyzed by histology. In Vivo and Ex Vivo Bioimaging, Histological, and IHC Analysis of Orthotopic Thyroid Tumors. The computed tomography, multispectral fluorescence scanner (CRi Maestro 500, CRi Inc., Woburn, MA), histopathology, and IHC are described in the supplemental online data. Scoring for Metastases. Metastases were counted and averaged at 40\u00a1\u00bf using hematoxylin and eosin?stained, formalin-fixed sections of lymph nodes and lungs. Mass Spectrometric Genotyping. Genomic DNA from thyroid cancer lines was purified and subjected to mass spectrometric genotyping as described previously [22]. The RET/PTC-1 analysis was performed according to Puxeddu et al. [23]. Statistical Analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel with Student's t-test and the \u00a5\u00f6 2 test. p-values <.05 were considered significant (*p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001). The data represent the average \u00a1\u00be standard deviation or, in the case of real-time RT-PCR or mice experiments, mean \u00a1\u00be standard error of the mean. Results. PLX4720 Downregulates ERK-1/ERK-2 Phosphorylation and Inhibits Migration and Invasion in 8505c Cells Harboring B-Raf V600E. For our in vitro studies, we used 8505c, an aggressive and authentic [24] human thyroid carcinoma cell line that we have shown to be tumorigenic and metastatic in vivo [21] and to harbor the V600E mutation and TP53 R248G mutation (by mass spectrometric genotyping) (Fig. 1A); 8505c cells were found to be negative for other mutations (e.g., H-, N-, and K-RAS mutations, etc.). Treatment with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 resulted in a >90% reduction in phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 protein levels after 1 hour (Fig. 1B) with no significant difference in cell proliferation (BrdU uptake) even after 72 hours (control versus PLX4720 treatment, 22.6% \u00a1\u00be 3.3% versus 18.4% \u00a1\u00be 1.4%; p = 0.1) (Fig. 2A, ?A,2B,2B, ?B,2D),2D), whereas treating 8505c cells with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 for 1 hour or 72 hours reduced phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 (Fig. 1B, ?B,1C),1C), reduced BrdU uptake (19.8% \u00a1\u00be 0.8% versus 3.7% \u00a1\u00be 1.2% in control versus PLX4720, respectively; p = .001), reduced the S-phase cell fraction (Fig. 2A, ?A,2B),2B), and caused G 1 arrest (38.9% \u00a1\u00be 1.8% versus 56.4% \u00a1\u00be 1.9% in control versus PLX4720, respectively; p < .001) (Fig. 2D). PLX4720 treatment (1 \u00a5\u00ecM or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM) did not lead to apoptosis (absence of sub-G 1 cell population) according to the flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 2D). Recently, it was demonstrated that PLX4720 induces activation of C-Raf [25]. We analyzed C-Raf protein levels and did not find a significant difference after 1 hour with PLX4720 treatment compared with controls (supplemental online Fig. 1A). Additionally, the Raf?ERK pathway can synergize with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt?mediated signaling on specific biochemical effectors [26] and we wanted to see whether phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 downregulation by PLX4720 could affect downstream targets such as Akt phosphorylation levels. We found no significant difference in phospho-Akt ser473 protein levels in 8505c cells after 1 hour with PLX4720 treatment, compared with the control (supplemental online Fig. 1A). We have previously shown an important role for B-Raf V600E in mediating migration and invasion of 8505c into Matrigel [19]. One micromolar PLX4720 reduced migration from 71.3 \u00a1\u00be 1.5 cells/field to 35 \u00a1\u00be 1 migrated cells/field, and 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 further reduced migration to 26 \u00a1\u00be 6.7 cells/field (p < .001) (Fig. 3A, ?A,3B).3B). Invasion was also approximately twofold lower using 1 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 (27.2 \u00a1\u00be 6.7 cells/field versus 52.7 \u00a1\u00be 2.1 cells/field; p < .001) and fourfold lower using 10 \u00a5\u00ecM (13.6 \u00a1\u00be 4.0 cells/field versus 59.5 \u00a1\u00be 8.8 cells/field; p < .001) (Fig. 3A, ?A,33B). PLX4720 Causes Significant Reduction in Cell Proliferation and Migration in TPC-1 Cells. TPC-1 is another authentic human thyroid carcinoma cell line [24] with a known RET/PTC-1 translocation [27] that we have confirmed to have wt B-Raf and found to harbor a PIK3CA H1047R mutation (Fig. 1A) (by mass spectrometric genotyping); TPC-1 cells were found to be negative for other mutations (e.g., H-, N-, and K-RAS mutations, etc.). Though TPC-1 cells grew rapidly in vitro, they showed very low in vivo tumorigenicity, with a mean tumor size <1 mm 3 after 60 days post-orthotopic injection (supplemental online Fig. 2). Paradoxically, in TPC-1 cells, treatment with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 for 1 hour resulted in higher phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 protein levels (by approximately 80%); however, 1 hour of treatment with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 reduced phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 by about 45% (Fig. 1B). Seventy-two hours of treatment with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 resulted in persistently elevated levels of phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 protein (95% and 400%, respectively) (Fig. 1B, ?B,1C).1C). Both 1 \u00a5\u00ecM and 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 caused lower cell proliferation as measured by BrdU uptake (27.9% \u00a1\u00be 6.0% in controls versus 12.9% \u00a1\u00be 2.9% with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720; p = .01 and 36.7% \u00a1\u00be 2.2% with control treatment versus 14.9% \u00a1\u00be 0.2% with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720; p = .001) (Fig. 2A?2C). Neither 1 \u00a5\u00ecM nor 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 lead to apoptosis (absence of sub-G 1 cell population) in TPC-1 cells evaluated by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 2D). In addition, we found that only 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 reduced the migration of TPC-1 cells after 72 hours of treatment. Migration was about 1.6-fold lower (42.6 \u00a1\u00be 16.7 cells/field versus 78.6 \u00a1\u00be 6.8 cells/field) with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 (Fig. 3A). No significant differences were found for invasion with either 1 \u00a5\u00ecM or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 (Fig. 3B). There was no significant difference in the levels of phospho-Akt ser473 (supplemental online Fig. 1A) or C-Raf with PLX4720, compared with controls (supplemental online Fig. 1B). PLX4720 Inhibits Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion in NT Cells with B-Raf V600E Overexpression. To understand the role of B-Raf V600E in thyroid cell migration and invasion in the heterozygous setting, we stably overexpressed B-Raf V600E in NT cells (passage 0). These NT cells have two wt B-Raf alleles, are positive for cytokeratin, and are negative for desmin, indicating epithelial origin. They are also positive for the following thyroid-specific markers: TSH receptor, thyroperoxidase (TPO), thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1, and paired box gene 8 (PAX-8) (supplemental online Fig. 3). Stably overexpressing B-Raf V600E in NT cells (B-Raf V600E?NT cells) resulted in greater B-Raf mRNA and protein expression: 4.24 \u00a1\u00be 0.1 copies in empty vector NT cells versus 52.4 \u00a1\u00be 6.1 copies in B-Raf V600E?NT cells (p < .001) (Fig. 3C). Stable B-Raf V600E overexpression (detected by anti-tag-c-myc-B-Raf V600E antibody) in these otherwise normal early-passage thyroid follicular cells, even in the presence of a wt B-Raf allele (heterozygous wt B-Raf/B-Raf V600E), resulted in profound functional changes including: (a) significantly higher phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 protein levels than in NT cells transduced with the empty vector (Fig. 3C), (b) greater cell migration (35.2 \u00a1\u00be 5.2 cells/field in overexpressed B-Raf V600E NT cells versus 6.7 \u00a1\u00be 2.7 cells/field in the control; p < .001) (Fig. 3D), and (c) greater invasion (60.2 \u00a1\u00be 8.0 cells/field in overexpressed B-Raf V600E cells versus 12.2 \u00a1\u00be 2.0 cells/field in the control; p < .001) (Fig. 3D). PLX4720 treatment (1 \u00a5\u00ecM) of B-Raf V600E?NT cells resulted in lower migration?21.2 \u00a1\u00be 7.4 cells/field versus 35.2 \u00a1\u00be 5.2 cells/field in cells treated with the vehicle (p < .05)?and 10 \u00a5\u00ecM was even more effective at reducing migration?10.7 \u00a1\u00be 3.4 cells/field in cells treated with PLX4720 versus 37 \u00a1\u00be 12.6 cells/field in cells treated with the vehicle; p < .01 (Fig. 3D). One micromolar PLX4720 also resulted in lower B-Raf V600E?NT cell invasion?21 \u00a1\u00be 0.8 cells/field versus 60.2 \u00a1\u00be 8.0 cells/field in cells treated with the vehicle (p < .001). Ten micromolar PLX4720 was even more effective at reducing invasion?9.5 \u00a1\u00be 1.9 cells/field in cells treated with PLX4720 versus 59 \u00a1\u00be 11.1 cells/field in cells treated with the vehicle; p < .001 (Fig. 3D). B-Raf V600E?NT cells treated with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 (but not with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM) showed significantly lower cell proliferation?17.3% \u00a1\u00be 1.8% in cells treated with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 versus 27.3% \u00a1\u00be 0.7% in cells treated with vehicle; p = .01 (supplemental online Fig. 4). No significant differences in cell proliferation (supplemental online Fig. 4), migration, or invasion were found in NT cells transduced with the empty vector treated with PLX4720 (either 1 \u00a5\u00ecM or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM), compared with the vehicle (Fig. 3D). PLX4720 Inhibits Tumor Aggressiveness In Vivo. Sixteen animals had 8505c cells tagged with GFP orthotopically implanted into the right thyroid lobe. One week after tumor implantation, mice were randomized and treatment was initiated; eight animals were treated with PLX4720 (30 mg/kg per day for 21 days) by oral gavage and eight received control gavage. Control mice began to lose weight and develop dramatic signs of cachexia at approximately 28 days. By 35 days, all controls showed evidence of cachexia and demonstrated an average weight loss from baseline of 4.2 g \u00a1\u00be 1.1 g (23% of baseline \u00a1\u00be 6%) (p < .001) (Fig. 4). However, the mice in the PLX4720 treatment group maintained their weight and showed no signs of cachexia (Fig. 4). Five weeks post?tumor implantation, all animals were sacrificed and there was a dramatically (97%) lower tumor volume in PLX4720-treated animals than in controls (1.9 mm 3 versus 72 \u00a1\u00be 18 mm 3; p < .001) (Fig. 4). These results confirm the in vivo effects of PLX4720 with thyroid cancer cells that harbor B-Raf V600E [19]. Here, for the first time, we show detailed histological and IHC analyses performed on B-Raf V600E-positive orthotopic thyroid carcinomas treated with PLX4720 or vehicle (control). The control tumors grew circumferentially around the trachea with extrathyroidal extension, and these tumors demonstrated histologic features of aggressiveness such as tracheal invasion, pleomorphism, and numerous mitotic figures (Fig. 5A1?5A4). The PLX4720-treated mice, however, had small and discrete tumor foci with minimal evidence of local invasion grossly or histologically (Fig. 5A5?5A8). Additionally, the proliferative index (Ki67 nuclear expression) in the PLX4720-treated orthotopic tumors was significantly lower than in the control (p < .01) (Fig. 4). None of the mice showed gross evidence of lung metastasis, but on fluorescence microscopy there were numerous evident metastases in control mice lungs with a dramatically lower number of metastases in treated animals (99% lower) (Fig. 4B). Histologic evaluation showed that eight mice from the control group had multiple metastatic foci (average, 15.7 \u00a1\u00be 2.4) (Fig. 5B1, 5B2), whereas no histological evidence of lung metastasis could be found in the lungs of the PLX4720-treated mice (average, 0) (p < .001) (Fig. 5B5, 5B6). Lymph node metastases are not frequently seen in our model of thyroid cancer (<50% of cases) (Fig. 5B3, 5B4) and no lymph node metastases were seen in the PLX4720-treated group (Fig. 5B7, 5B8). Tumors from mice receiving PLX4720 showed upregulation of thyroid-specific cell differentiation markers (i.e., TTF-1 and PAX-8) at the protein level by IHC (Fig. 5C). IHC staining showed moderate immunoexpression of TTF-1 (diffuse nuclear localization) in PLX4720-treated 8505c orthotopic thyroid tumors, compared with weaker immunoexpression in untreated 8505c orthotopic thyroid tumors (control). Similarly, PAX-8 IHC showed weak cytoplasmic localization staining and absence in the nuclei in control orthotopic carcinomas, whereas the PLX4720-treated orthotopic carcinomas showed greater focal nuclear positivity (with normal thyroid follicular cells that were strongly positive in the nuclei) (Fig. 5C). Other thyroid cell differentiation markers, such as TPO, thyroglobulin (Tg), TSH receptor, and human sodium?iodide symporter (hNIS), showed neither immunoexpression in the controls nor upregulation after 3 weeks of PLX4720 treatment in this model. Additionally, given that PLX4720 caused a paradoxical increase in phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 in vitro in wt B-Raf thyroid cancer cells (TPC-1) and wt B-Raf NT cells, we tested in vivo phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 levels in mouse tissues that express wt B-Raf after treatment with PLX4720. We found no significant difference in phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 levels in tissue protein extracts from muscles of SCID mice, compared with control animals, 35 days post?tumor injection (supplemental online Fig. 1B). PLX4720 Downregulates Genes Involved in Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion. In order to identify genes that are downstream targets of the B-Raf V600E signaling cascade, we quantified absolute mRNA expression in vitro in both 8505c and TPC-1 human thyroid cancer cells following treatment with PLX4720 or vehicle. We analyzed mRNA copy number of early and late gene expression with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM of PLX4720 for many genes crucial to the control of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion mechanisms (supplemental online Table 1). In 8505c cells, we found that only high doses (10 \u00a5\u00ecM) of PLX4720 led to significantly lower mRNA expression levels at 72 hours in the following: cyclin D1 (CCND1) (12.1 \u00a1\u00be 0.4 copies), thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) (12.6 \u00a1\u00be 1.2 copies), and integrin \u00a5\u00e16 (ITGA6) (2.9 \u00a1\u00be 0.33 copies), compared with controls (38.1 \u00a1\u00be 1.7 copies, 45.6 \u00a1\u00be 1.3 copies, and 9.7 \u00a1\u00be 0.4 copies, respectively; p < .05) (Fig. 6). In contrast, we found that the TSP-1 copy number was lower in 8505c cells after 24 hours of treatment with PLX4720 at both the 1 \u00a5\u00ecM (32.4 \u00a1\u00be 0.58 copies) and 10 \u00a5\u00ecM (11.4 \u00a1\u00be 0.9 copies) levels, compared with controls (67.84 \u00a1\u00be 2.27 copies and 48.05 \u00a1\u00be 0.9 copies, respectively; p < .05) (Fig. 6). In addition, the TSP-1 copy number was lower in TPC-1 cells treated with PLX4720 (at both the 1 \u00a5\u00ecM and 10 \u00a5\u00ecM levels) than in controls (Fig. 6). In 8505c cells, we found that both 1 \u00a5\u00ecM and 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 resulted in a higher mRNA expression level of the thyroid follicular cell differentiation marker TTF-1 at 72 hours of treatment (9.5 copies and 9.5 \u00a1\u00be 0.4 copies, respectively) than in controls (5.1 \u00a1\u00be 0.2 copies and 5.1 \u00a1\u00be 0.3 copies, respectively; p < .05) (Fig. 6). The TTF-1 copy number was greater in 8505c cells after 24 hours of PLX4720 treatment with both 1 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 (25.5 \u00a1\u00be 1.2 copies) and 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 (14.7 \u00a1\u00be 0.3 copies) than in controls (19.6 \u00a1\u00be 0.9 copies and 11.4 \u00a1\u00be 0.5 copies, respectively; p < .05) (Fig. 6). In contrast, PAX-8 showed low mRNA basal levels (<1 copy number). Furthermore, TPO, Tg, TSH receptor, and hNIS showed very low mRNA copy numbers (<0.2 copy number) and no upregulation with PLX4720 treatment in 8505c cells; this result was also confirmed by IHC, which showed undetectable protein levels both in controls and in PLX4720-treated orthotopic thyroid carcinomas. Discussion. The typical treatment regimen of surgical excision, levothyroxine suppression, and radioactive iodine is successful in close to 90% of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. However, for the group of patients who fail to respond to this treatment paradigm or initially present with aggressive and refractory thyroid carcinoma, survival rates are very low [28]. There are very few clinical trials for thyroid cancer [29], with a partial response rate of 30% in some single-agent studies [30]. The response rate for ATC is much lower, and consequently, >50% of thyroid cancer deaths are attributed to ATC [1]. By identifying the \u00a1\u00b0driving events\u00a1\u00b1 behind thyroid cancer proliferation and migration/invasion, targeted molecular agents hold great potential for aggressive thyroid cancer. Current molecular strategies involve interrupting intracellular signal transduction pathways at specific targets, such as B-Raf, Ras, MEK, PI3K, RET, cMet, and epidermal growth factor [31]. Given that B-Raf V600E is the most prevalent mutation implicated in the initiation and aggressiveness of PTC, and possibly in the progression of PTC to ATC [31, 32], targeting this mutation holds great potential for novel therapies. We chose to study this both in vitro and in vivo using PLX4720, a potent and selective B-Raf V600E inhibitor. In one previous report, in vitro treatment of B-Raf V600E-positive thyroid cancer cell lines with PLX4720 (50% inhibitory concentration in the range of 78?113 nM) showed cell cycle arrest, whereas RET/PTC-1 and Ras mutated thyroid cancer cell lines were resistant to inhibition even at 500 nM [27]. In contrast, we found that only higher doses (both 1 \u00a5\u00ecM and 10 \u00a5\u00ecM) of PLX4720 caused cell cycle arrest and inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion in 8505c cells (B-Raf V600E). Interestingly, by overexpressing B-Raf V600E in NT cells, we were able to create a heterozygous model that genetically reproduces human thyroid cancers that have both a B-Raf V600E allele and a wt B-Raf allele. With this overexpression of B-Raf V600E, the ability of NT cells to invade and migrate was much greater than in controls. The gain of these functions was effectively inhibited by 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720, suggesting a strong role for B-Raf V600E in thyroid cancer progression. Therefore, this is the first in vitro translational demonstration that PLX4720 might be a useful compound in clinical trials for patients with thyroid cancers harboring the B-Raf V600E mutation. Recently, it was shown that PLX4720 could have unexpected effects in some cell contexts (e.g., presence of wt B-Raf and mutated Ras) as a result of ERK-1/ERK-2 activation [25, 33, 34]. However, in our study, PLX4720 treatment of NT cells (wt B-Raf/wt B-Raf) transduced with empty vector did not result in greater proliferation, migration, or invasion despite a higher level of phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2. Somewhat unexpectedly, cell proliferation and migration were also inhibited in TPC-1 cells (RET/PTC-1 translocation, PIK3CA H1047R mutation, and wt B-Raf). These results indicate that certain wt B-Raf thyroid tumors (perhaps those that harbor RET/PTC-1 and/or PIK3CA H1047R) might be somewhat responsive to PLX4720 treatment as well. Further preclinical validation is needed to understand this phenomenon prior to human testing. PLX4720 treatment downregulated genes involved in cell proliferation, such as CCND1, and certain genes known to be important in migration, invasion, and metastasis, such as TSP-1 and ITGA6 [35]. We have previously shown that knockdown of TSP-1 decreases phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 levels and reduces thyroid cancer progression [19], perhaps through binding of the N-terminal domain of TSP-1 to integrins such as \u00a5\u00e13\u00a5\u00e21 or \u00a5\u00e16\u00a5\u00e21 [36, 37]. TSP-1 is known to be intimately involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation by affecting early response genes [38], and our data are consistent with those results [19]. Our in vitro studies show higher phospho-ERK-1/ERK-2 levels when TPC-1 cells are treated with PLX4720. Recent findings by Hatzivassiliou et al. [34] showed that ATP-competitive Raf inhibitors, including PLX4720, have opposing roles as inhibitors and activators of ERK-1/ERK-2 phosphorylation depending on the cellular and genotypic context. Furthermore, other authors recently reported that inhibition of wt B-Raf by PLX4720 in Ras mutant (e.g., N-Ras) human cancer cells (i.e., melanoma cells) leads to MEK?ERK-1/ERK-2 hyperactivation through C-Raf [25]. These aforementioned studies [25, 33, 34, 39] and others [40] highlight the importance of individualized genomic profiling to guide patient selection for inclusion in targeted therapy trials. We also found that PLX4720 treatment in vitro and in vivo in 8505c cells upregulated important thyroid-related transcription factors, such as TTF-1 and PAX-8, that have been widely described as markers of thyroid follicular cell differentiation, thus suggesting that B-Raf V600E might play a biological role in thyroid follicular cell dedifferentiation. In vivo, we demonstrated a dramatic reduction in tumor aggressiveness in our orthotopic mouse model of ATC. PLX4720 treatment reduced tumor volume by 97% and virtually eliminated metastatic spread to the lungs. Though the ATC cell line 8505c also harbors a TP53 mutation [41], the selective inhibition of B- Raf V600E was sufficient to dramatically reduce tumor volume, extrathyroidal extension, and metastasis without any obvious toxicity. Both in vitro and in vivo results point to the potential therapeutic utility of this drug in patients with advanced B-Raf V600E thyroid cancers. In conclusion, our study shows that inhibition of B-Raf V600E with the novel agent PLX4720 results in dramatic changes in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, and early intervention with this drug results in marked inhibition of tumor aggressiveness in an in vivo model of ATC harboring B-Raf V600E. Our in vitro model using primary human NT follicular cells (heterozygous wt B-Raf/B-Raf V600E) recapitulates the genetic status of this mutation in human thyroid cancer, and is the first preclinical model to show that PLX4720 inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in a B-Raf V600E heterozygous model. PLX4720 might be an effective therapy for appropriately selected patients with metastatic or refractory thyroid cancers that harbor the B-Raf V600E mutation. Summary and Clinical Relevance. Despite considerable enthusiasm about targeted therapies and understanding the underlying reasons why the B-Raf V600E mutation may lead to more aggressive clinical behavior in some patients with thyroid cancer, there have not been many studies on the inhibition of B-Raf V600E. Our study shows that inhibition of B-Raf V600E with the novel agent PLX4720 can decrease cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in thyroid cancer cell lines and markedly inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model of human ATC harboring B-Raf V600E. Additionally, our in vitro model using primary human NT cells (heterozygous wt B-Raf/B-Raf V600E) recapitulates the genetic status of this mutation in human thyroid cancer; it is the first translational demonstration to show that PLX4720 is effective in a B-Raf V600E heterozygous model. Our results suggest that PLX4720 might be an effective therapy in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with B-Raf V600E-positive thyroid cancers that are refractory to conventional therapy.

Oncolytic viruses show promise for treating cancer. However, to assess therapeutic efficacy and potential toxicity, a noninvasive imaging modality is needed. This study aimed to determine if insertion of the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) cDNA as a marker for non-invasive imaging of virotherapy alters the replication and oncolytic capability of a novel vaccinia virus, GLV-1h153. Methods. GLV-1h153 was modified from parental vaccinia virus GLV-1h68 to carry hNIS via homologous recombination. GLV-1h153 was tested against human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 for replication via viral plaque assays and flow cytometry. Expression and transportation of hNIS in infected cells was evaluated using Westernblot and immunofluorescence. Intracellular uptake of radioiodide was assessed using radiouptake assays. Viral cytotoxicity and tumor regression of treated PANC-1tumor xenografts in nude mice was also determined. Finally, tumor radiouptake in xenografts was assessed via positron emission tomography (PET) utilizing carrier-free 124I radiotracer. Results. GLV-1h153 infected, replicated within, and killed PANC-1 cells as efficiently as GLV-1h68. GLV-1h153 provided dose-dependent levels of hNIS expression in infected cells. Immunofluorescence detected transport of the protein to the cell membrane prior to cell lysis, enhancing hNIS-specific radiouptake (P < 0.001). In vivo, GLV-1h153 was as safe and effective as GLV-1h68 in regressing pancreatic cancer xenografts (P < 0.001). Finally, intratumoral injection of GLV-1h153 facilitated imaging of virus replication in tumors via 124I-PET. Conclusion. Insertion of the hNIS gene does not hinder replication or oncolytic capability of GLV-1h153, rendering this novel virus a promising new candidate for the noninvasive imaging and tracking of oncolytic viral therapy. Introduction. Oncolytic viral therapies have shown such success in preclinical testing as a novel cancer treatment modality that several phase I and II trials are already underway. Oncolytic vaccinia virus (VACV) strains have been of particular interest due to several advantages. VACV's large 192-kb genome enables a large amount of foreign DNA to be incorporated without reducing the replication efficiency of the virus, which has been shown not to be the case with some other viruses such as adenoviruses [1]. It has fast and efficient replication, and cytoplasmic replication of the virus lessens the chance of recombination or integration of viral DNA into cells. Perhaps most importantly, its safety profile after its use as a live vaccine in the World Health Organization's smallpox vaccination program makes it particularly attractive as an oncolytic agent and gene vector [2]. Currently, biopsy is the gold standard for monitoring the therapeutic effects of viral oncolysis [3-5]. This may be feasible in preclinical or early clinical trials, however, a noninvasive method facilitating ongoing monitoring of therapy is needed for human studies. The tracking of viral delivery could give clinicians the ability to correlate efficacy and therapy and monitor potential viral toxicity. Furthermore, a more sensitive and specific diagnostic technique to detect tumor origin and, more importantly, presence of metastases may be possible [3]. Here, we report on the construction and testing of a VACV carrying the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) as a marker gene for non-invasive tracking of virus by imaging. This virus was derived from VACV GLV-1h68, which has already been shown to be a simultaneously diagnostic and therapeutic agent in several human tumor models including breast tumors [6], mesothelioma [7], canine breast tumors [8], pancreatic cancers [9], anaplastic thyroid cancers [10,11], melanoma [12], and squamous cell carcinoma [13]. Materials and methods. Virus and cell culture. African green monkey kidney fibroblast CV-1 cells and human pancreatic ductal carcinoma PANC-1 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Mediatech, Inc.) at 37\u00a1\u00c6C under 5% CO 2. Rat thyroid PCCL3 cells were a kind gift from the lab of Dr. James Fagin at MSKCC and were maintained in Coon's modified medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 5% calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mM NaHCO3, and 6H hormone (1 mU/ml bovine TSH, 10 ug/ml bovine insulin, 10 nM hydrocortisone, 5 ug/ml transferrin, 10 ng/ml somatostatin, and 2 ng/ml L-glycyl-histidyl-lysine) at 37\u00a1\u00c6C under 5% CO 2. GLV-1h68 was derived from VACV LIVP, as described previously [6]. Construction of hNIS transfer vector. The hNIS cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using human cDNA clone TC124097 (SLC5A5) from OriGene as the template with primers hNIS-5 (5'-GTCGAC(Sal I) CACCATGGAGGCCGTGGAGACCGG-3') and hNIS-3 (5'-TTAATTAA(Pac I) TCAGAGGTTTGTCTCCTGCTGGTCTCGA-3'). The PCR product was gel purified, and cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector using Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). The resulting construct pCRII-hNIS-1 was sequenced, and found to contain an extra 33-bp segment in the middle of the coding sequence, representing an alternative splicing product for hNIS. To remove this extra 33-bp segment, two additional primers were designed to flank the segment, and used in the next set of PCR. In the next round of reactions, hNIS-5 paired with hNIS-a3 (5'-GAGGCATGTACTGGTCTGGGGCAGAGATGC-3'), and hNIS-a5 (5'-CCCAGACCAGTACATGCCTCTGCTGGTGCTG-3') paired with hNIS-3 were used in separate PCRs, both with pCRII-hNIS-1 as the template. The respective PCR products were then mixed and used as the templates in one reaction with hNIS-5 and hNIS-3 as the primer pair. The final PCR product was again cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector as pCRII-hNISa-2, confirmed by sequencing to be identical to the SLC5A5 sequence in GenBank (accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NM_000453\",\"term_id\":\"164663746\",\"term_text\":\"NM_000453\"}}NM_000453). The hNIS cDNA was then released from pCRII-hNIS-1 with Sal I and Pac I, and subcloned into HA-SE-RLN-7 with the same cuts by replacing RLN cDNA. The resulting construct HA-SE-hNIS-1 were confirmed by sequencing and used for insertion of PE-hNIS into the HA locus of GLV-1h68. Generation of hNIS-expressing VACV. CV-1 cells were infected with GLV-1h68 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 hour, then transfected using Fugene (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) with the hNIS transfer vector. Two days post infection, infected/transfected cells were harvested and the recombinant viruses selected and plaque purified as described previously [14]. The genotype of hNIS-expressing VACV GLV-1h153 was verified by PCR and sequencing. Also, expression of GFP and \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u00a5\u00e2-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), respectively, and lack of expression of gusA was confirmed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u00a5\u00e2-D-glucuronic acid (X-GlcA, Research Product International Corp., Mt. Prospect, IL). Viral growth curves. PANC-1 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates at 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells per well. After 24 hours in culture, cells were infected with either GLV-1h153 or GLV-1h68 at an MOI of 0.01 or 1.0. Cells were incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 1 hour with brief agitation every 30 minutes to allow infection to occur. The infection medium was then removed, and cells were incubated in fresh growth medium until cell harvest at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours post infection. Viral particles from the infected cells were released by 3 freeze-thaw cycles, and the titers determined as (PFU/10 6) in duplicate by plaque assay in CV-1 cell monolayers. Flow cytometry. Cells were seeded on 6-well plates at 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells per well. Wells were then infected at MOIs of 0, 0.01, and 1.0, and cells then harvested at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours postinfection by trypsinizing and washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For the second experiments, cells were seeded on 6-well plates at 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells per well. Wells were then infected at MOIs of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5, and were harvested in the same manner at 24 hours after infection. GFP expression was analyzed via a Becton-Dickinson FACScan Plus cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Analysis was performed using CellQuest software (Becton-Dickinson). hNIS mRNA analysis via microarray. To evaluate the level of hNIS mRNA production in infected cells, cells were plated at 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells per well and infected with GLV-1h153 at an MOI of 5.0. Six and 24 hours postinfection, 3 samples of each time point were harvested and lysis performed directly using RNeasy mini kit protocol (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The mRNA samples were measured by spectrophotometer for proof of purity and hybridized to HG-U133A cDNA microarray chips (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA) by the genomic core laboratory at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). The chip images were scanned and processed to CEL files using the standard GCOS analysis suite (Affymetrix Inc). The CEL files were then normalized and processed to signal intensities using the gcRMA algorithm from the Bioconductor library for the R statistical programming system. All subsequent analysis was done on the log (base 2) transformed data. To find differentially expressed genes a moderated t-test was used as implemented in the Bioconductor LIMMA package. To control for multiple testing the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method was used with a cutoff of 0.05. hNIS protein analysis via Western blot. To confirm whether the hNIS protein was being expressed in infected cells, cells were plated at 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 per well and infected with GLV-1h153 at various MOIs of virus, harvested at 24 hours, and suspended with SDS-PAGE and 0.5-m DDT reagent. After sonication, 30 ug of the protein samples were loaded on 10% Bis-Tris-HCl buffered polyacrylamide gels using the Bio-rad system (Bio-rad laboratories, San Francisco, CA). Following gel electrophoresis for 1 hour, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using electroblotting. Membranes were then preincubated for 1 hour in 5% low fat dried milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) to block nonspecific binding sites. Membranes were incubated with a purified mouse antibody against hNIS at 1:100 dilution (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) and incubated for 12 hour at +4\u00a1\u00c6C. After washing with TBS-T, secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California) was applied for 1 hour at room temperature at a 1:5,000 dilution. Peroxidase-bound protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) at room temperature for approximately 1 minute and using Kodak BIOMAX MR films for exposure. Normal human thyroid lysate was used as a positive control, and cells treated with GLV-1h68 and PBS were used as negative controls. Immunofluorescence. PANC-1 cells grown in a 12-well plate at 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 were mock-infected with GLV-1h68 or infected with GLV-1h153 at an MOI of 1.0. Twenty-four hours after infection the cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with methanol, blocked with PBS containing BSA, and incubated with a mouse anti-hNIS monoclonal antibody (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) at a dilution of 1:100, followed by incubation with a secondary red fluorochrome-conjugated goat antimouse antibody (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:100. Pictures were taken using a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope. In vitro radiouptake assay. Radio-uptake in cells infected with GLV-1h153 was compared to rat thyroid cell line PCCL3 endogenously expressing NIS and to cells infected with parental virus GLV-1h68. Cells were plated at 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 per well in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours after infection with MOIs of 0.01, 0.10, and 1.0, cells were treated with 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecCi of either carrier-free 131I or 131I with 1 mM of sodium perchlorate (NaClO4), a competitive inhibitor of hNIS, for a 60-minute incubation period. Media was supplemented with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM of sodium iodide (NaI). Iodide uptake was terminated by removing the medium and washing cells twice with PBS. Finally, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer for residual radioactivity, and the cell pellet-to-medium activity ratio (cpm/g of pellet versus cpm/mL of medium) calculated from the radioactivity measurements assayed in a Packard \u00a5\u00e3-counter (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Results were expressed as change in uptake relative to negative uninfected control. All samples were done in triplicate. In vitro cytotoxicity assay. PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells were plated at 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 per well in 6-well plates. After incubation for 6 hours, cells were infected with GLV-1h153 or GLV-1h68 at MOIs of 1.00, 0.10, 0.01, and 0 (control wells). Viral cytotoxicity was measured on day 1 and every second day thereafter by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Results are expressed as the percentage of surviving cells as compared to uninfected control. In vivo tumor therapy studies and systemic toxicity. All mice were cared for and maintained in accordance with animal welfare regulations under an approved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the San Diego Science Center, San Diego, California. PANC-1 xenografts were developed in 6- to 8-week-old male nude mice (NCI:Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu, Harlan) by implanting 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 PANC-1 cells in PBS subcutaneously in the left hindleg. Tumor growth was recorded once a week in 3 dimensions using a digital caliper and reported in mm 3 using the formula (length \u00a1\u00bf width \u00a1\u00bf [height-5]). When tumors reached 100-300 mm 3, mice were injected intratumorally (IT) or intravenously (IV) via the tail vein with a single dose of 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 PFUs of GLV-1h153 or GLV-1h68 in 100 \u00a5\u00ecL PBS. Animals were observed daily for any sign of toxicity, and body weight checked weekly. Radiopharmaceuticals. 124I and 131I were obtained from MSKCC's radiopharmacy. The maximum specific activities for the 124I and 131I compounds were ~140 \u00a5\u00ecCi/mouse and ~0.5 \u00a5\u00ecCi/well, respectively. In vivo PET imaging. All animal studies were performed in compliance with all applicable policies, procedures, and regulatory requirements of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the Research Animal Resource Center of MSKCC, and the National Institutes of Health \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\" Three groups of 2-3 animals bearing subcutaneous PANC-1 xenografts on the left hindleg measuring were injected intratumorally with 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 7 PFU GLV-1h153 (3 mice), 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 7 PFU GLV-1h68 (2 mice), or PBS (2 mice). Two days after viral injection, 140 \u00a5\u00ecCi of 124I was administered via the tail vein. One hour after radiotracer administration, 3-dimensional list-mode data were acquired using an energy window of 350 to 700 keV, and a coincidence timing window of 6 nanoseconds. Imaging was performed using a Focus 120 microPET dedicated small animal PET scanner (Concorde Microsystems Inc, Knoxville, TN). These data were then sorted into 2-dimensional histograms by Fourier rebinning. The image data were corrected for (a) nonuniformity of scanner response using a uniform cylinder source-based normalization, (b) dead time count losses using a single-count rate-based global correction, (c) physical decay to the time of injection, and (d) the 124I branching ratio. The count rates in the reconstructed images were converted to activity concentration (%ID/g) using a system calibration factor (MBq/mL per cps/voxel) derived from imaging of a mouse-size phantom filled with a uniform aqueous solution of 18F. Image analysis was performed using ASIPro (Siemens Pre-clinical Solutions, Knoxville, TN). Statistical analysis. The GraphPad Prism 5.0 program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for data handling and analysis. The significance of differences between the 3 therapy groups (untreated, GLV-1h153, GLV-1h68) was determined via two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. P values were generated for radiouptake assay comparisons using Dunnett's test [15]. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results. Construction of the hNIS transfer vector. The GLV-1h153 construct used in this study was derived from GLV-1h68 by replacing the \u00a5\u00e2-glucuronidase (gusA) expression cassette at the A56R locus with the hNIS expression cassette (SE-hNIS) containing the hNIS cDNA under the control of the VACV synthetic early promoter, by homologous recombination in infected cells. The genotype of GLV-1h153 (Figure ?(Figure1a)1a) was verified by PCR and sequencing, and the lack of \u00a5\u00e2-glucuronidase expression was confirmed by X-GLcA staining (Figure ?(Figure1b1b). GLV-1h153 replicated efficiently in PANC-1 cells. To evaluate the replication efficiency and effect of hNIS protein expression on VACV replication, PANC-1 cells were infected with either GLV-1h153 or its parental virus, GLV-1h68, at MOIs of 0.01 and 1.0, and the infected cells harvested at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours post infection. The viral titers at each time point were determined in CV-1 cells using standard plaque assays. Both GLV-1h153 and GLV-1h68 replicated in PANC-1 cells at similar levels, indicating that the hNIS protein did not hinder viral replication within cells. GLV-1h153 yielded a 4-log, or 10,000-fold, increase of viral load with an MOI of 0.01 only 72 hours after infection. Within this time, viral load with an MOI of 0.01 reached the same levels as infection with an MOI of 1.0, again indicating efficient replication (Figure ?(Figure2a2a). GLV-1h153 replication was assessed via flow cytometric detection of GFP. GFP expression in cells infected with either GLV-1h68 or GLV-1h153 was quantified using flow analysis, and was shown to be both time and MOI dependent. Adjusting for background, GFP expression mimicked the viral replication growth curve, with GFP expression in cells infected at an MOI of 0.01 reaching similar levels to an MOI of 1.0 by 72 hours (Figure ?(Figure2b).2b). Further, >70% of live cells expressed GFP at an MOI of 5.0 at 24hrs postinfection (Figure ?(Figure2c2c). Production of hNIS mRNA and protein in infected cells was shown via microarray analysis and Western blot. To confirm production of hNIS mRNA by GLV-1h153-infected PANC-1 cells, cells were infected at an MOI of 5.0 and mRNA isolated for analysis with Affymetrix chips. mRNA in cells had an almost 2000-fold increase by only 6 hours after infection, and a >5000-fold change by 24 hours (P < 0.05) (Figure ?(Figure3a).3a). To show hNIS protein expression by GLV-1h153, PANC-1 cells were mock infected or infected with GLV-1h153 or parental virus GLV-1h68 at MOIs of 0.1, 1.0, and 5.0 and harvested 24 hours after infection. Production of the hNIS protein was successfully detected by Western blot between 75 and 100 KiloDalton, with an increasing concentration of protein at higher MOIs (Figure ?(Figure3b).3b). The difference in molecular weight of hNIS between the positive control and infected cells is likely due to the different levels of glycosylation, as noted by several other groups [16,17]. The hNIS protein was localized at the cell membrane of PANC-1 cells. To determine whether the hNIS protein expressed by GLV-1h153 was successfully transported and inserted on the cell membrane, PANC-1 cells were infected with GLV-1h153 and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde. The hNIS protein was visualized using a monoclonal anti-hNIS antibody that recognizes the intracellular domain of the protein. As shown in Figure ?Figure3c,3c, mock- or GLV-1h68-infected cells (as demonstrated by GFP expression) did not show hNIS protein expression, whereas the hNIS protein in cells infected with GLV-1h153 was readily detectable by immunofluorescence microscopy, and appears to be localized at the cell membrane. GLV-1h153-infected PANC-1 cells showed enhanced uptake of carrier-free radioiodide. To establish that the hNIS symporter was functional, cells were mock infected or infected at an MOI of 1.0 with GLV-1h153 and GLV-1h68, then treated with 131I at various times after infection. Normal rat thyroid cell line PCCL3 was used as a positive control. PANC-1 cells infected with GLV-1h153 showed a >70-fold increased radiouptake compared with mock-infected control at 24 hours post infection (P < 0.0001) despite similar cell protein levels, compared to 2.67 and 1.01-fold increased radiouptake with MOIs of 0.1 and 0.01, respectively (Figure ?(Figure4a).4a). This increased uptake correlated with peak GFP expression (Figure ?(Figure4b).4b). Moreover, when cells were treated with NaClO4, a competitive inhibitor of hNIS, radiouptake decreased in GLV-1h153-treated cells, from a 70- to a 1.14-fold difference at an MOI of 1.0, indicating hNIS-specific radiouptake. Radiouptake in cells infected with GLV-1h153 was compared to rat thyroid cell line endogenously expressing NIS (PCCL3), and to cells infected with parental virus GLV-1h68 or mock infected. Cells were plated at 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells per well in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were treated with 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecCi of either carrier free 131I or 131I with 1 mM of sodium perchlorate (NaClO4), a competitive inhibitor of hNIS for a 60-minute incubation period. Media was supplemented with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM of sodium iodide (NaI). Iodide uptake was terminated by removing the medium and washing cells twice with PBS. Finally, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer for residual radioactivity, and the cell pellet-to-medium activity ratio (cpm/g of pellet/cpm/mL of medium) calculated from the radioactivity measurements assayed in a Packard \u00a5\u00e3-counter (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Results are expressed as change in uptake relative to negative uninfected control. All samples were done in triplicate. GLV-1h153 was cytolytic against PANC-1 cells in vitro. To investigate whether expression of hNIS would affect cytolytic activity of VACV in cell cultures, PANC-1 cells were infected with GLV-1h68 or GLV-1h153 at MOIs of 0.01and 1.0. Viral cytotoxicity was measured every other day for 11 days. The survival curves for GLV-1h68 and GLV-1h153 were almost identical at both MOIs, indicating that the cells infected by either of the virus strains were dying at similar levels in a time- and dose-dependent fashion (Figure ?(Figure5a).5a). By day 11, More than 60% cell kill was achieved with an MOI of 1.0 as compared to control. GLV-1h153 was safe and effective at regressing PANC-1 tumor xenografts in vivo. To establish cytolytic effects of GLV-1h153 in vivo, mice bearing PANC-1 xenograft tumors on hindleg were infected intratumorally ( ITly) or intravenously (IVly) with GLV-1h153 or GLV-1h168, or mock treated with PBS. While the growth of tumors treated with PBS continued to grow, GLV-1h153-treated tumors occurred in three distinct phases: growth, inhibition, and regression (Figure ?(Figure5c).5c). The mean relative size of tumors treated with GLV-1h153 was significantly smaller than untreated control tumors, with differences beginning as early as day 13 (P < 0.01), and continuing till day 34 after virus or PBS control administration (P < 0.001). By day 34, there was an over 4-fold difference between control and IV tumor volumes, and an over 6-fold difference in the IT group. Furthermore, there were no significant adverse effects seen with regard to body weight, with the IT group even gaining weight as compared to control with statistically significant results by day 34 (P < 0.05) (Figure ?(Figure5d5d). GLV-1h153-enhanced radiouptake in PANC-1 tumor xenografts and was readily imaged via PET. After successful cell culture uptake studies we wanted to show the feasibility of using GLV-1h153 in combination with carrier-free 124I radiotracer to image infected PANC-1 tumors. hNIS protein expression in the PANC-1 tumor-bearing animals after GLV-1h153 administration was visualized by 124I PET. Carrier free 124I was IVly administered 48 hours after IT virus injection and PET imaging was performed 1 hour after radiotracer administration. GLV-1h153-injected tumors were easily detected, whereas GLV-1h68- and PBS-injected tumors could not be visualized and therefore were not significantly above background (Figure ?(Figure66). Discussion. Oncolytic viral therapy is emerging as a novel cancer therapy. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown a number of oncolytic viruses to have a broad spectrum of anti-cancer activity and safety [18]. These are ongoing, and the first oncolytic viral therapy has now been approved in China as a treatment for head and neck cancers [19]. Clinical trials are underway to assess the effects of many other oncolytic viral therapies [20]. However, future clinical studies may benefit from the ability to noninvasively and serially identify sites of viral targeting and to measure the level of viral infection and spread in order to provide important information for correlation with safety, efficacy, and toxicity [3-5]. Such real-time tracking would also provide useful information regarding timing of viral dose and administration for optimization of therapy, as well as distribution and replication of the oncolytic virus, and would alleviate the need for multiple and repeated tissue biopsies. VACV is arguably the most successful biologic therapy agent, since versions of this virus were given to millions of humans during the smallpox eradication campaign [2]. More recently, engineered VACVs have also been successfully used as direct oncolytic agents, capable of preferentially infecting, replicating within, and killing a wide variety of cancer cell types [6-11,13,21]. VACV displays many of the qualities thought necessary for an effective oncolytic antitumor agent. In particular, the large insertional cloning capacity allows for the inclusion of several functional and therapeutic transgenes. With the insertion of reporter genes not expressed in uninfected cells, viruses can be localized and the course of viral therapy monitored in patients. One such promising virus strain is GLV-1h68[21]. This strain has shown efficacy in the treatment of a wide range of human cancers and is currently being tested in phase I human trials[20]. In this study we describe the generation of a novel recombinant VACV, GLV-1h153, derived from GLV-1h68, which has been engineered for specific targeted treatment of cancer and the additional capability of facilitating noninvasive imaging of tumors and metastases. To our knowledge, GLV-1h153 is the first oncolytic VACV expressing the hNIS protein. The reporter gene chosen for insertion into GLV-1h153 was based on the already successful PET and SPECT imaging characteristics of the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) and carrier-free radioiodine reporter imaging system. hNIS is an intrinsic plasma membrane protein that mediates the active transport and concentration of iodide in thyroid gland cells and some extra-thyroidal tissues [16,17]. Although endogenous NIS is physiologically and functionally expressed in several normal tissues, so far only 2 human cancers - some thyroid cancers, and around 80% of breast cancers including ductal carcinomas - have been shown to express endogenous NIS functionally, making them amenable to radiotherapy [22]. It is one of several human reporter genes that are currently being used in preclinical studies and has even been used in clinical studies imaging prostate cancer [20,23]. hNIS gene transfer via viral vector may allow infected tumor cells to concentrate several commercially available, relatively inexpensive radionuclide probes, such as 123I, 124I, 125I, and 99mTcO 4, all of which have long been approved for human use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, allowing noninvasive imaging of tumors expressing NIS [22]. In contrast to a study published by McCart et al. [24] using an oncolytic VACV expressing the human somatostatin receptor hSSTR2, hNIS is a transporter-based reporter gene system. Whereas receptors usually have a 1:1 binding relationship with a radiolabeled ligand, transporters provide signal amplification through transport-mediated concentrative intracellular accumulation of substrate. hNIS use has also been shown to be comparable to the commonly used HSV1-tk reporter gene [25] and correlated with 99mTcO 4 [26]. This can be very useful for viral distribution with scintigraphy or PET scanning during and after viral therapy, and may allow for correlation with efficacy and toxicity during clinical trials and treatment thus offering potential clinical translation of this dual therapy. In order to take advantage of the therapeutic and imaging potential of hNIS, several groups have attempted exogenous NIS gene transfer in several human cancers including head and neck squamous cell cancers, non-small cell lung, thyroid, liver, colorectal, and prostate cancers, as well as glioma and multiple myeloma [22]. Studies have shown that hNIS gene delivery to both thyroidal and non-thyroidal, non-organifying tumor cells is capable of inducing accumulation of therapeutically effective radioiodine doses. For example, a single therapeutic 131I dose of 3 mCi was shown to elicit a dramatic therapeutic response in NIS-transfected prostate cell xenografts, with an average volume reduction of more than 90% [27]. Transfection of an hNIS-defective follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line with the hNIS gene was able to reestablish iodide accumulation activity both in cell culture and in animal models [28]. Furthermore, transfection of pancreatic cancer cells with a replication-deficient adenoviral vector expressing hNIS lead to a more than 15-fold increase in iodide uptake visualized with 123I scintigraphy, and an over 75% reduction in volume in vivo after treatment with 3mci of 131I [29]. We have previously reported on the use of a novel recombinant VACV, GLV-1h99, a derivative of GLV-1h68, which was constructed to carry the human norepinephrine transporter gene (hNET) under the VACV synthetic early promoter placed at the F14.5L locus for deep tissue imaging [30,31]. The parental virus GLV-1h68, a recombinant VACV (LIVP strain), was constructed by inserting 3 expression cassettes (Renilla luciferase-Aequorea green fluorescent protein (RUC-GFP) fusion, \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase, and \u00a5\u00e2-glucuronidase) into the F14.5L, J2R, and A56R loci of the viral genome, respectively [6]. The hNET protein was expressed at high levels on the membranes of cells infected with GLV-1h99, and expression of the hNET protein did not negatively affect virus replication in cell culture or in vivo virotherapeutic efficacy. GLV-1h99-mediated expression of the hNET protein in infected cells resulted in specific uptake of the radiotracer [ 131I]-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ([ 131I]-MIBG). In mice, GLV-1h99-infected tumors, including pancreatic and mesothelioma, were readily imaged by [ 124I]-MIBG PET. However, one of the disadvantages of using hNET is that it requires the carrier MIBG for radioiodine uptake. GLV-1h153 was effective at infecting and replicating within pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells as efficiently as its parental virus GLV-1h68. This indicated that insertion of the hNIS protein did not negatively affect virus replication in cell culture. With the hNET-expressing GLV-1h99 virus, on the other hand, there was slight improvement in viral replication and oncolytic effect, which may have been due to the exchange of expression cassettes under the control of promoters with different strengths. Microarray analysis revealed an almost 2000-fold change increase in hNIS mRNA and an almost 5000-fold change increase by 24 hours after PANC-1 infection with GLV-1h153 at a multiplicity of infection of 5.0. Western blot studies showed hNIS protein expression as a band between 75 and 100 KiloDalton in PANC-1 cells infected with GLV-1h153, with higher concentrations of the protein at higher MOIs. This band also appears in normal human thyroid lysates at a slightly lower molecular weight, which is likely explained by differences in glycosylation within cells [16]. The hNIS protein was successfully transported and inserted into the cell membrane, as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy. In vitro, GLV-1h153-mediated expression of the hNIS protein in infected PANC-1 cells resulted in specific uptake of the radiotracer 131I, indicating that the hNIS protein was functional, with the uptake reaching a >70-fold increase compared with uninfected control at an MOI of 1.0. GLV-1h153 was also effective at infecting, replicating within, and killing PANC-1 cells and eradicating tumor xenografts as efficiently as parental virus GLV-1h68. This indicated that insertion of the hNIS protein did not negatively affect virus replication in vivo which was already demonstrated in vitro, or the cytolytic activity in cell culture and in vivo virotherapeutic efficacy. Similar effects were seen between the IT and IV groups treated with GLV-1h153 or GLV-1h68, indicating the inherent affinity of both genetically modified vaccinia viruses to tumors. Furthermore, administration of GLV-1h153 did not have any significant effects on mean net body weights of the animals 34 days after treatment, with the IT groups even gaining weight as compared to untreated control. Finally, in mice, three PANC-1 tumors infected with GLV-1h153 were readily detectable by PET, with no enhancement above background of either GLV-1h68- or PBS-treated tumors. Mice were treated intratumorally with GLV-1h153, non-hNIS expressing parent virus GLV-1h68, and PBS, and imaged 48 hours after with carrier free 124I. The quantitative 124I -PET showed that imaging of GLV-1h153 infection of PANC-1 tumors is feasible after direct tumor injection. As with any translational therapy, concerns over immune responses remain. Since hNIS is a human derived gene, it is unlikely to be immunogenic. However, application of GLV-1h153-mediated hNIS transfer raises concerns over the possibility of autoimmunity in patients. Several papers have already shown that hNIS is not a major candidate for autoimmune disease in patients with patients with Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis [32,33]. Moreover, a clinical trial assessing adenoviral-mediated hNIS transfer in humans did not report any serious adverse effects due to autoimmunity in patients treated for prostate cancer [23]. Further studies and caution will be needed to assess the potential of autoimmunity with hNIS transfer in humans. Studies are also now underway to determine the viral biodistribution, as well as the dose and timing related aspects of in vivo imaging using this novel virus. Conclusions. We have therefore shown that a novel new oncolytic VACV engineered to carry the human sodium iodide symporter gene (hNIS) can successfully replicate within and kill pancreatic cancer cells as efficiently as its parental virus GLV-1h68. GLV-1h153 expresses the hNIS reporter gene, which enhances radiouptake in vitro and is readily imaged with the clinically approved radiopharmaceutical 124I via PET. The ability of GLV-1h153 to infect and enhance cellular uptake of iodine in cells of pancreatic cancer origin, a uniformly fatal disease resistant to conventional therapy, justifies further studies as well as the initiation of clinical trials. Further, this imaging system could be directly translated to human studies, as clinical trials of oncolytic viral therapy would benefit from this noninvasive monitoring modality. Abbreviations.

                "text": "Deactivation of Akt by a small molecule inhibitor targeting pleckstrin homology domain and facilitating Akt ubiquitination\tThe phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding function of pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is essential for the activation of oncogenic Akt/PKB kinase. Following the PIP3-mediated activation at the membrane, the activated Akt is subjected to other regulatory events, including ubiquitination-mediated deactivation. Here, by identifying and characterizing an allosteric inhibitor, SC66, we show that the facilitated ubiquitination effectively terminates Akt signaling. Mechanistically, SC66 manifests a dual inhibitory activity that directly interferes with the PH domain binding to PIP3 and facilitates Akt ubiquitination. A known PH domain-dependent allosteric inhibitor, which stabilizes Akt, prevents the SC66-induced Akt ubiquitination. A cancer-relevant Akt1 (e17k) mutant is unstable, making it intrinsically sensitive to functional inhibition by SC66 in cellular contexts in which the PI3K inhibition has little inhibitory effect. As a result of its dual inhibitory activity, SC66 manifests a more effective growth suppression of transformed cells that contain a high level of Akt signaling, compared with other inhibitors of PIP3/Akt pathway. Finally, we show the anticancer activity of SC66 by using a soft agar assay as well as a mouse xenograft tumor model. In conclusion, in this study, we not only identify a dual-function Akt inhibitor, but also demonstrate that Akt ubiquitination could be chemically exploited to effectively facilitate its deactivation, thus identifying an avenue for pharmacological intervention in Akt signaling. A number of pathogenic conditions, including cancer, arise from perturbation of intracellular signaling pathways that control the amount of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) at the membrane. PIP3 level is mainly controlled positively by PI3K and negatively by lipid phosphatase PTEN (1, 2). PIP3 exerts its functions by mediating the recruitment of various signaling effectors at the membrane. The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (also known as PKB) is one of the major downstream effectors recruited by PIP3. Akt contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which specifically binds to PIP3, enabling its membrane translocation and subsequent activation by upstream kinases (3,4). The activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a variety of proteins involved in diverse cellular processes, including cell proliferation and survival (5). Because of its crucial involvement in tumorigenesis and drug resistance of cancer cells, the PIP3/Akt pathway has been the primary target for anticancer drug development (5, 6). Various current efforts to inhibit Akt function are mainly focused in two aspects: reducing PIP3 level and inhibiting Akt activity (7?11). We also showed that two inositol phosphates, InsP7 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, compete with PIP3 for binding to Akt PH domain (12, 13). Additionally, recent studies revealed that the ubiquitination of Akt plays important regulatory functions (14?16), providing a potential new avenue for pharmacological intervention. In this study, we identified and characterized a dual-function Akt inhibitor that directly facilitates Akt ubiquitination and deactivation. We demonstrated its efficacy toward a cancer-relevant and PI3K inhibitor-resistant Akt1 (e17k) mutant. As a result of its dual inhibitory activity, SC66 manifests a more effective growth suppression of transformed cells compared with other inhibitors of PIP3/Akt pathway. Therefore, this study offers validation for the chemical-assisted ubiquitination as a legitimate strategy to terminate Akt signaling. Results.  Cell-Based Screening Identifies a Compound that Directly Facilitates Akt Ubiquitination.. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms of the PIP3/Akt pathway, we carried out an image-based chemical screening by using the spatial distribution of Akt1 PH domain/EGFP fusion protein (PH-EGFP) as a read-out (to be described elsewhere). This screening identified a group of 12 chemicals (termed group II) that not only prevented the membrane translocation of PH-EGFP, but also induced its accumulation into a subcelluar location reminiscent to the pericentrosomal region (Fig. S1 and Dataset S1). Interestingly, the compounds SC13, SC66, and SC67 contain a pyridine moiety that is also found in some chemicals known to inhibit Akt (17, 18). In this study, we focused on characterizing SC66 as a representative of this group of compounds. First, we confirmed that this subcellular location indeed represented the pericentrosomal region by immunostaining with \u00a5\u00e3-tubulin, a centrosomal marker (Fig. 1A). The SC66-induced pericentrosomal accumulation was specifically mediated by Akt PH domain, as EGFP alone or EGFP fused to PH domain from PLC-\u00a5\u00e4 had no effect (Fig. 1A). Other group II compounds also showed no effect on the membrane localization of PH-PLC\u00a5\u00e4-EGFP (Fig. S2). The level of PIP3 at the membrane did not affect the SC66-induced pericentrosomal localization, as cotreatment with IGF1 or PI3K inhibitor failed to yield any differential effects. Likewise, a PIP3-nonbinding mutant PH (r25c)?EGFP was also accumulated in the pericentrosomal region. As revealed by colocalization with PH-EGFP, the full-length Akt1 could be also accumulated in this region by SC66 and other group II compounds (Fig. 1A and Fig. S3). To test if SC66 could inhibit the Akt signaling pathway, HEK293T cells, which were shown to contain a high level of PIP3 (19), were treated with different amounts of SC66, and the whole-cell lysates were examined for the phosphorylation level of Akt and its known target proteins (Fig. 1B). At a concentration that led to the pericentrosomal accumulation, SC66 significantly reduced the phosphorylation level of both Akt and its targets, but not those of other cellular kinases. Importantly, unlike the Akt phosphorylation at S473, the phosphorylation at T450 was not affected by SC66, indicating that SC66 did not manifest inhibitory effects toward upstream kinase mTorc2, which was reported to be responsible for the phosphorylation of both T450 and S473 of Akt. We also tested the inhibitory effects of SC66 and other group II compounds on the Akt activation stimulated by IGF1 in HeLa cells. (Fig. S4A). Overall, all these chemicals inhibited Akt phosphorylation at or below the concentration of 8 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL, which is equivalent to 1\u00a1\u00bf concentration of the initial high-throughput chemical screening. The cytoplasm to nuclear translocation of proapoptotic transcription factor Foxo1 is tightly regulated by Akt activity. To assess the effects of group II compounds on Akt function at the cellular level, we used live cell imaging by using EGFP-Foxo as a read-out (20). The majority of group II compounds were found to inhibit the cytoplasmic retention of EGFP-Foxo, whereas SC67, 86, and E26 displayed relatively weaker inhibitory activity (Fig. S4B). To determine if the group II compounds could also affect the levels of PIP3, the selected compounds were treated to serum-starved HeLa cells. Following IGF1 stimulation, the level of PIP3 was measured (Fig. S4C). Unlike the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, none of the tested group II compounds significantly reduced the PIP3 level, indicating that their inhibitory effect on the Akt phosphorylation was not caused by reduction of PIP3 level. This finding was also consistent with their inhibitory patterns of target phosphorylation, more similar to Akt inhibition than PI3K inhibition (Fig. S4A). Next, we sought to determine the mechanisms of group II-mediated inhibition of Akt activation. As these compounds did not affect the cellular PIP3 level, we explored the possibility that they may directly interfere with the PIP3 binding function of PH domain. To test this idea, purified PH-EGFP was incubated with PIP3-coated beads in the presence of group II compounds. The amount of PH-EGFP brought down by the PIP3-beads would be inversely correlated with the inhibitory activity of compound toward the PIP3 binding function of PH domain (Fig. S4D). This assay implicated that all group II compounds, in varying degrees, could interfere with PH domain binding to PIP3 in vitro. One of the important functions of the pericentrosomal region is the recycling and degradation of cellular proteins (21). The accumulation of Akt in this region may reflect its degradation through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway. Indeed, when HEK293 cells stably expressing Akt1, HEK293-Akt1, were treated with SC66, a robust accumulation of the ubiquitinated Akt was observed (Fig. 1C). The level of SC66-induced Akt ubiquitination was further increased by cotreatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. A similar result was also observed with the endogenous Akt in HeLa cells (Fig. S5A). A longer treatment of SC66 decreased the level of total Akt in both HeLa and HEK293T cells (Fig. S5B). Together, these results confirmed that the ubiquitinated Akt by SC66 could be targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation. Some group II compounds also led to the accumulation of ubiquitinated Akt (Fig. S5C). Of note is the finding that SC67, which is structurally similar to SC66 (Fig. S1), led to a much weaker accumulation of ubiquitinated Akt. All group II compounds, including SC66, did not display any significant inhibitory effects toward the cellular proteasome or deconjugation (i.e., deubiquitination) activity (Fig. S5D). Next, we established a cell-free system to examine if group II compounds could directly affect Akt ubiquitination (Fig. S6A). The in vitro ubiquitination of Akt using the control HEK293 cell extracts appeared inefficient, and only a weak level of ubiqutinated Akt could be observed. Strikingly, however, in the presence of SC66 in this cell-free system, a robust ubiquitination was observed (Fig. 1D). The enhanced in vitro ubiquitination of Akt by SC66 was both time- and dose-dependent (Fig. 1D and Fig. S6B). Compared with the other group II compounds in the same in vitro assay, SC66 displayed the strongest activity, followed by SC67 and SC11 (Fig. S6C). To further test if the drug-bound Akt was susceptible for ubiquitination, the Akt immune complex was incubated with SC66. After removal of the compound by extensive washing, the resulting immune complex was subject to in vitro ubiquitination in the presence of fresh cell lysates (Fig. 1D). Intriguingly, the pretreatment of drug alone was found to be sufficient, indicating that the drug-bound Akt was amenable (or primed) for the subsequent ubiquitination. The efficiency of ubiquitination could be dependent upon the conformation(s) of target protein. To test if this is the case for the SC66-induced Akt ubiquitination, we took advantage of a known PH domain-dependent allosteric Akt inhibitor, AKTi-VIII (22), and asked if the SC66-induced Akt ubiquitination could be affected by this inhibitor. Surprisingly, when the lysates were preincubated with AKTi-VIII, the subsequent ubiquitination by SC66 was almost completely abolished (Fig. 1E). When SC66 was added first, followed by AKTi-VIII, Akt ubiquitination was also affected, but to a lesser extent. Other chemicals known to inhibit Akt functions failed to show any inhibitory effects (Fig. S6D). Together, these results confirm that SC66 directly facilitates Akt ubiquitination.  SC66 Functionally Inhibits a Cancer-Relevant Akt1 (e17k) Mutant.. A gain-of-function mutation in PH domain (e17k) of Akt1 has been identified from human cancers (23). Next, we examined if SC66 could be effective in functional inhibition of this mutant Akt1. As previously reported, when expressed in HEK293 cells, compared with the WT, the level of phosphorylated Akt was much higher in Akt1 (e17k), and a strong enrichment of phosphorylated Akt was found at the plasma membrane (Fig. S7A). We examined if group II compounds could inhibit the activation of this mutant. Seven group II compounds (SC1, 13, 19, 23, 27, 63, and 66) led to a greater than 50% inhibition in comparison with DMSO control (Fig. S7B). Intriguingly, SC66 manifested the strongest inhibitory activity, whereas its structural analogue, SC67, showed a marginal effect. To obtain a structure?activity relationship, we further confirmed the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of these two compounds on the activation of Akt1 (e17k) (Fig. 2A). This result was consistent with their relative activity to induce Akt ubiquitination (Figs. S5C and (S6C). To test if SC66 could inhibit the membrane localization of this mutant PH domain, the PH (e17k)?EGFP was expressed in HeLa cells and live cell imaging was performed. The membrane localization of PH (e17k)?EGFP was insensitive to inhibition of PI3K, as previously reported (23). However, SC66 effectively prevented its membrane localization whereas SC67 showed little inhibitory effect (Fig. 2B). When similar experiments were done with the WT PH-EGFP, both compounds effectively prevented the membrane localization (Fig. S8). Intriguingly, however, the pericentrosomal localization was more prominent in the presence of SC66. This result appears to be consistent with their relative activity in inducing Akt ubiquitination. Both SC66 and SC67 contained the pyridine moiety, and some Akt inhibitors were also shown to have this moiety (17, 18). Therefore, we also tested other pyridine-containing compounds represented in the screening library. At the comparable amount, none of these other compounds showed any inhibitory effect (Fig. 2B). Next, we examined if Akt1 (e17k) could be also ubiquitinated by SC66. Compared with WT, Akt1 (e17k) displayed a slightly faster kinetics of ubiquitination, and the phosphorylated (S473) Akt could be also ubiquitinated in this in vitro reaction. It has been shown that phosphorylation at turn motif (T450) by mTorc2 complex regulates Akt maturation and stability (24, 25). However, Akt1 (e17k) showed a comparable level of phosphorylation at T450 as the WT (Fig. S9A). Nonetheless, compared with the WT, Akt1 (e17k) was found to be unstable in the presence of 17 AAG, an inhibitor of HSP90. The instability of Akt1 (e17k) upon inhibition of HSP90 was not affected by cellular level of PIP3, as neither wortmannin nor LY294002 led to a significant difference. However, the allosteric Akt inhibitor, AKTi-VIII, significantly inhibited the degradation of this mutant Akt1, indicating this inhibitor acts as a stabilizer (Fig. S9B). Similarly, we examined the effects of cellular PIP3 level and Akt conformation on the SC66-induced ubiquitination. The pretreatment of AKTi-VIII, but not LY294002, almost completely inhibited the SC66-induced ubiquitination of Akt1 (e17k) (Fig. 2C). This differential effect was consistent with their respective inhibitory activity toward the SC66-induced in vitro Akt ubiquitination (Fig. 1E). To examine this effect at the cellular level, HeLa cells expressing Akt1 (e17k) were treated with AKTi-VIII, SC66, or a combination of the two, and immunostaining was performed. In control cells, Akt1 (e17k) was predominately at the membrane, and nuclear localization was also evident. AKTi-VIII dramatically perturbed this cellular localization, making it evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). In the presence of SC66, the level of membrane-associated and cytosolic Akt1 (e17k) was reduced, with a prominent increase in the nucleus. Importantly, when combined, the pattern of its localization resembled that of AKTi-VIII treatment alone (Fig. 2C). The finding that SC66 was effective toward the Akt1 (e17k) mutant has an important implication, as human cancers carrying this mutation would be resistant to any therapeutic manipulations to reduce the PIP3 level. Therefore, we next compared the efficacy of SC66 with LY294002 in inhibiting Akt1 (e17k) function. When coexpressed with Akt1 (e17k), EGFP-Foxo was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm even in the presence of LY294002, confirming the resistance of Akt1 (e17k) toward PI3K inhibitor. However, in the presence of SC66, a significant portion of EGFP-Foxo was localized to the nucleus. A subsequent immunostaining confirmed that only those cells expressing Akt1 (e17k) were refractory to LY294002, whereas such cells were still sensitive to SC66 (Fig. S10). The mechanisms by which LY294002 and SC66 inhibit activation of Akt are completely different (i.e., inhibition of PIP3 production vs. PH domain binding to PIP3). Therefore, these two drugs should enhance the inhibitory activity toward Akt1 (e17k) function when combined. To test this possibility, EGFP-Foxo was cotransfected with Akt1 (e17k) and treated with different amounts of LY294002, SC66, or a combination of the two. The localization of EGFP-Foxo in cells expressing Akt1 (e17k) was analyzed and scored as cytosolic, equal, or nuclear to reflect the strength of functional inhibition of Akt1 (e17k) (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the previous findings, even at a high concentration of LY294002, most EGFP-Foxo was localized to the cytoplasm. The majority of EGFP-Foxo at lower concentration of SC66 alone was equally distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, when combined with LY294002, the proportion of cells containing nuclear EGFP-Foxo was substantially increased.  SC66 Enhances Cancer Cell Death Mediated by PI3K Inhibition.. Previously, we established deactivation of Akt as a crucial mediator of cancer cell death (26). Accordingly, we evaluated the pharmacological properties of SC66 as a potential anticancer agent. Inhibition of Akt is known to suppresses the motility of cancer cells (27). Similar to LY294002 and AKTi-VIII, SC66 but not SC67 effectively inhibited the migration of HeLa cells (Fig. 3A and Fig. S11 A and B). To examine the effects on cell proliferation/death, we used time-lapse imaging, which allowed us to monitor the mitotic and apoptotic cells in a real-time fashion (28). As a measure of cell proliferation or death, we counted the number of cells entering mitosis or undergoing apoptosis during the 14-h imaging time. In control condition, approximately 45% of cells entered mitosis, which is consistent with a doubling time of 20 to 24 h in HeLa cells. In the presence of different inhibitors of PI3K, AKTi-VIII, or SC66, this percentage was reduced to 10% to 30%, confirming the growth-inhibitory property of these chemicals. Within this time period, no dramatic cell death could be observed with all chemicals tested, including SC66 (Fig. 3B). The relative growth inhibition was correlated with the level of phosphorylated Akt in the presence of each compound (Fig. S12). When treated in HeLa cells grown in serum-rich conditions, SC66 effectively inhibited phosphorylation of both Akt and its targets. Importantly, consistent with their different mode of action in preventing Akt activation, a combined treatment of SC66 and LY294002 led to an efficient inhibition (Fig. S13A). PIP3 is required for various cellular processes, and cancer cells may activate the compensatory mechanisms when PI3K is inhibited. When treated with LY294002, the level of Akt phosphorylation reached the lowest level within the first 1 h, but was recovered in the next several hours. A similar trend was also observed with wortmannin, an irreversible PI3K inhibitor. Importantly, the kinetics and degree of recovery were almost identical between two different concentrations of wortmannin (Fig. S13B). Also, because both LY24002 and wortmannin were effective in inhibiting cell proliferation (Fig. 3B), the chemical instability alone did not explain this effect. Similarly, when HeLa cells were treated with LY294002, a prominent nuclear localization of EGFP-Foxo was observed within the first 1 h. However, after overnight treatment, most of EGFP-Foxo was localized to the cytoplasm of surviving cells (Fig. 3C). More importantly, when these HeLa cells were subsequently treated with the same amount of LY294002, only approximately 50% of cells displayed the nuclear EGFP-Foxo, indicating the activation of compensatory mechanisms. In contrast, when SC66 was administered to these cells, an efficient inhibition of Akt activity was still observed, confirming that LY294002-resistant Akt activation could be suppressed by SC66 (Fig. 3C). If SC66 effectively suppresses the reactivation of Akt in cancer cells that had survived the inhibition of PI3K, then the combined treatment would result in an enhanced apoptosis. We examined this effect by live cell imaging of HeLa cells treated with SC66 (Movie S1), LY294002 (Movie S2), or a combination of the two (Movie S3). Surprisingly, when combined in a concentration at which neither of the two drugs alone was effective, a dramatic cancer cell death was observed (Fig. 3D, Fig. S13 C and D, and Movie S3). This synergistic cell death was not restricted to epithelial cancer cells, but was also observed in HS-Sultan cells, a lymphoma cell line (Fig. S13E).  SC66 Manifests Anticancer Activity in Vitro and in Vivo.. SC66 displays a dual-inhibitory function toward Akt activity: inhibition of the initial activation by interfering with PH domain binding to PIP3 and deactivation by facilitated ubiquitination. We reasoned that, because of this dual inhibitory activity, SC66 may manifest effective anticancer activity in cancer cells with a high level of PIP3 signaling. Consistent with this prediction, compared with control, SC66 preferentially suppressed the viability of HEK cells transformed by SV40 large T antigen (HEK293T) or oncogenic Ras (HEK-Ras), both of which retained elevated Akt signaling, even in the absence of serum growth factors (Fig. S14). In addition, at a comparable concentration, SC66 resulted in a more effective inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and its target proteins compared with LY294002 and API-2, an Akt inhibitor (29) (Fig. 4A). This biochemical result was correlated with their relative growth inhibitory effect as determined by the cell viability assay (Fig. 4B). The anticancer activity of SC66 was further supported by its potent inhibitory effects on the colony formation of HEK293T cells grown on soft agar (Fig. 4C). Finally, by using the mouse xenograft tumor model, we tested if this anticancer activity could be extended to in vivo. Seven days after the inoculation of HEK293T cells, the mice were injected with SC66 twice per week and the size of tumors was measured every 3 d for 21 d. Compared with vehicle alone, SC66 led to a significant inhibition of tumor growth, confirming the anticancer property in vivo (Fig. 4C). Discussion. In this study, we identified a group of chemicals that inhibit Akt activation through interfering with PH domain binding to PIP3, and lead to pericentrosomal localization of Akt. Altering the spatial distribution of Akt can lead to functional perturbation by affecting substrate recognition and facilitating dephosphorylation. Elucidating the mode of action of these compounds will undoubtedly provide important new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of oncogenic PIP3/Akt signaling pathway and the development of new therapeutic strategies. We extensively characterized a pyridine-based allosteric Akt inhibitor, SC66, that directly facilitates Akt ubiquitination in vitro and in vivo. We elucidated the mechanisms of its dual inhibitory function, identified the efficacy toward a cancer-relevant and PI3K inhibitor-resistant Akt1 (e17k) mutant, and demonstrated the synergistic apoptotic activity with the PI3K inhibitor and the in vivo anticancer efficacy as a single agent. We also showed that, because of its unique dual inhibitory activity, SC66 manifested a more effective growth suppression of transformed cells compared with other inhibitors of PIP3/Akt pathway. The phosphorylated Akt was found to be ubiquitinated in an in vitro assay. Intriguingly, the phosphorylated and ubiquitinated Akt could be hardly detectable in lysates from cells treated with SC66. Inhibition of initial phosphorylation by preventing Akt membrane translocation may explain this finding. However, given its efficacy toward Akt dephosphorylation in HEK293T cells, which contain a high level of PIP3, also indicates other possibilities. For example, the phosphorylated Akt, when bound to SC66, might be rapidly dephosphorylated and/or the ubiquitinated Akt by SC66 might be less likely to be phosphorylated. This prediction would be consistent with its inhibitory effects toward Akt1 (e17k) mutant, which is \u00a1\u00b0membrane-prone\u00a1\u00b1 independent of PIP3. Further studies, including the identification of cellular factors involved in SC66-mediated Akt ubiquitination, are needed to clarify these issues. As such, SC66 represents a unique chemical tool to investigate the mechanisms of ubiquitination-dependent Akt regulation in physiological and stressed conditions. Materials and Methods.  Cell Culture and Stable Cell Lines.. For routine maintenance, all cell lines were cultured in medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin under 5% CO 2. HEK293, HeLa, and their derivative cell lines were maintained in DMEM. NB4 and HS-Sultan cells were cultured in RPMI medium. HeLa cell lines stably expressing PH-EGFP were described previously (30). Other stable HEK293 cell lines expressing Akt1 mutants, Akt 3, or PH-EGFP were generated by transfecting the corresponding expression plasmids and selected and maintained in the presence of G418 (Invitrogen).  Time-Lapse Live Cell Imaging for Spatial Distribution of EGFP Fusion Proteins.. HeLa cells transfected with the plasmids encoding the EGFP fusion proteins were plated into a 35-mm glass-bottom dish (MatTek) and cultured for 24 to 48 h before imaging. For PH-EGFP membrane translocation assay, cells were serum-starved in 2 mL Leibovitz L15 medium for 1 to 2 h, which was replaced with 1 mL of fresh serum-free Leibovitz L15 medium containing each compound. After 30 min incubation, IGF1 (5 ng/mL) was added and an image was taken every 5 to 10 min under a 40\u00a1\u00bf oil objective lens. The relative fluorescent intensity at the membrane versus adjacent cytoplasm (for PH-EGFP) or cytoplasm versus nucleus (for EGFP-Foxo) was determined. Western blot and immnunostaining, PIP3 ELISA, in vitro PIP3 binding, in vitro ubiquitination assay, time-lapse live cell imaging analysis for mitotic and apoptotic cells, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and other related assays are described in SI Materials and Methods.  Mouse Xenograft Experiment.. Eight-week-old female NOD/SCID mice were used in this study. Fifteen mice received an s.c. injection of 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 293T cells in the both flanks. Seven days after injection, mice were randomized into three groups (n = 5 mice per group) to receive vehicle (control) or SC66 15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg i.p. SC66 dissolved in DMSO was further diluted in 0.2 mL of PBS solution containing 25% ethanol for i.p. injections. SC66 was administered twice per week (total of six times). The size of tumor was measured three times per week by using a caliper, and mice were killed on day 28 after the injection of cancer cells. The tumor volumes were calculated as length \u00a1\u00bf width 2 \u00a1\u00bf 0.52. Data are presented as the mean value. A Student t test was performed to evaluate the difference between mean values. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Supplementary Material. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Novel Xenograft and Cell Line Derived From an Invasive Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm of the Pancreas Give New Insights Into Molecular Mechanisms\tObjectives. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are a unique entity with malignant potential. Histologically, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) arising in IPMN (intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma [IPMC]) appears similar to sporadic PDAC; biologically, however, IPMC seems to have a less aggressive clinical course. Little is known about the genetic signature of IPMC. In this study, we describe a novel xenograft model and cell culture created to biologically and genetically characterize these tumors. Methods. Xenograft mice and cell lines were created from IPMC. Global genomic changes were evaluated by cytogenetic analysis and array comparative genomic hybridization. Specific mutations and sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway activity were examined and xenografts evaluated for sensitivity to anti-Shh therapy. Results. Cytogenetic analysis showed a tetraploid karyotype with multiple aberrations. KRAS and p53 mutations and overexpression of the Shh pathway were identified. Array comparative genomic hybridization revealed multiple chromosomal aberrations comparable with previously published data in IPMNs. Murine xenograft tumors were sensitive to anti-Shh treatment. Conclusions. Characterization of IPMC cell lines and xenografts reveals similarities to previously published data on IPMN. In comparison to PDAC, moreover, these data reveal shared aberrations and distinct genomic changes. Thus, these xenograft model and cell lines may be useful for future preclinical investigations. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a clinically well-described entity of cystic pancreatic tumors. 1,2 Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have become a clinically important issue because they are increasingly diagnosed and account for approximately 10% to 20% of all pancreatic resections. 3-7 Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are characterized by mucin-producing cells, cystic dilation of the pancreatic duct system, and intraductal papillary growth. 8 Histologically, IPMNs may demonstrate a wide spectrum of cellular atypia ranging from mucinous metaplastic epithelium to invasive adenocarcinoma. Similar to conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), patients with IPMNs often present between the sixth and eighth decades of life, with lesions located predominantly in the head of the pancreas. 1,3 However, compared with PDAC, IPMNs have a less aggressive biological behavior. 9 Lesions are frequently detected incidentally before malignancy develops, 4 and even when the lesion is associated with invasive carcinoma (intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma [IPMC]), patients have fewer lymph node metastases, relatively limited local tumor spread, and a significantly better prognosis than those with PDAC. 6,10-16 Whereas patients with PDAC have 5-year survival rates of less than 25% after curative resection, 17-19 patients who undergo surgery for IPMC have a 5-year survival of more than 60%. 14,20-23 Consequently, many authors believe that IPMCs have distinct genetic and biological origins and therefore display a different clinical behavior from PDAC. 2,24 Although there is evidence for significant genetic differences between IPMC and PDAC, 24,25 the pathological and, in particular, genetic backgrounds underlying this hypothesis remain to be defined. To better understand the molecular mechanisms playing a role in neoplastic development, cell culture and xenograft models are widely used. 26 However, to our knowledge, there are no established molecular models for IPMNs currently available. In this paper, we report the creation of IPMC xenograft tumor and cell lines derived from a 57-year-old man who was found to have a pT3 N1 M0 G2 adenocarcinoma arising in a main duct IPMN. These novel IPMC xenograft model and cell line culture may give us new insights into the molecular mechanisms of IPMC and provide a new murine model for future preclinical investigation of malignant IPMNs. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Establishment of the Xenograft Tumor Line. Pathologic diagnosis was of a moderately differentiated (G2) adenocarcinoma arising in the background of IPMN, combined main and branch duct types. Five of the 13 lymph nodes isolated from the specimen contained a metastatic focus. A tissue sample approximately 1 cm in diameter taken from the invasive component was reduced to small pieces with scalpel blades, put into a medium (Roswell Park Memorial Institute [RPMI] 1640 medium, 1\u00a1\u00bf; Mediatech, Inc, Herndon, Va and Matrigel; BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif), and implanted subcutaneously into 10 immunodeficient mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) as a first mouse passage (MP1). Tumor growth was monitored, and mice with tumors 350 KLor more were killed; the tumor harvested, reduced to small pieces, and reimplanted into a second generation of mice (MP2). Tumors were then reimplanted several times to increase the number of xenograft tumors from this line. For every tumor passage, part of the tumor tissue was preserved in 10% formalin solution (SF 100-4; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa) for histological examination. Detection of KRAS and p53 Mutations in Xenografts. A 5- to 10-mg sample DNA was isolated using a standard protocol (Puregene DNA purification kit; Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, Minn). Subsequently, the KRAS loci at codon 12 (exon 2) and p53 sequences (exons 57?9) were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequences of the primers are listed in Supplementary Table 1 (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/MPA/A14). Conditions for the thermocycler were as follows: an initial denaturation step of 95\u00a1\u00c6C for 10 minutes, followed by 33 cycles of 94\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 seconds, 55\u00a1\u00c6C for 45 to 60 seconds (depending on the length of the PCR product), and 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 45 seconds. After amplification, PCR products were purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up system (Promega, Madison, Wis). Sequencing in the forward and reverse directions was done by means of an ABI 3730XL Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) in the DNA Core Facility of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Culture Procedure. Fresh pieces of tissue derived from a harvested xenograft tumor were removed aseptically and transferred to the RPMI medium (RPMI 1640, 1\u00a1\u00bf; Mediatech, Inc). The tissue was minced and transferred to culture dishes. The RPMI 1640 medium containing 2-mmol/L l-glutamine, 10-mmol/L 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, 1-mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 4.5-g/L glucose, 1.5-g/L bicarbonate, and 15% fetal bovine serum was used as the culture medium. The cell culture was kept at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and the medium changed twice a week. To calculate the doubling time of the cell culture, a suspension of 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 cells was plated onto 35-mm plastic dishes in the culture medium described previously. The number of cells was counted in duplicate at 24-hour intervals for 5 days. To confirm that the cell culture contained tumor cells derived from the IPMC tumor, DNA derived from approximately 3.6 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells was isolated according to standard procedures. The KRAS locus was amplified by PCR and the purified product sequenced bidirectionally as described previously. In addition, 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cultured cells derived from a third culture passage were injected subcutaneously into the flank of a nude mouse to reproduce the IPMN tumor in vivo. Karyotyping. The cytogenetic study of the cell line was performed in G-banded metaphase cells obtained from a 7-day-old culture and analysis of a total number of 10 cells. Karyotyping was performed at the Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Cytogenetics Core Facility, Brigham and Women\u00a1\u00afs Hospital, Boston. Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization. A human IPMC xenograft tumor was harvested and tumor-surrounding murine mesenchyme removed. Fresh-frozen sections were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining to confirm a cellularity of more than 95%. DNA was isolated from 140 mg of tumor tissue by standard procedures (Puregene DNA purification kit). Normal male DNA (Promega, Madison, Wis) was used as reference. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed using Agilent Technologies 244k oligonucleotide arrays (Agilent Control Software, Santa Clara, Calif) according to the recommended protocol as previously described. 27 Slides were scanned with an Agilent G2565 micro-array scanner. Sixteen-bit tagged image file format images were captured with GenePix Pro v7.0 (Agilent Control Software; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif) and the data extracted (Agilent Feature Extraction Software v9.1; Agilent Technologies) and analyzed (CGH Analytic Software; Agilent Technologies). Copy number alterations were considered significant if the log2 ratio was \u00a1\u00be2 SDs from the mean intensity of the entire experiment. 28 In addition to tumor tissue derived from the human specimen, xenograft tumors contain a certain percentage of mouse mesenchyme. To exclude artifacts derived from murine tissue, CGH was performed using a sample of normal mouse liver DNA as control. Real-Time Quantitative PCR for Sonic Hedgehog Pathway Signaling. RNA was extracted from xenograft tumor tissues of approximately 5- to 10-mg weight (RNAqueous isolation kit; Ambion, Austin, Tex). One-step multiplex TaqMan real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR was performed using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). Expression levels of human sonic hedgehog (Shh), Patched 1 (Ptch1), Patched 2 (Ptch2), Smoothened (Smo), and Gli2 were evaluated, using 18S ribosomal RNA as internal control. Probes and primers were designed to span exon-exon junctions to avoid amplification of contamination genomic DNA (Supplementary Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/MPA/A14). The thermal cycler conditions for these experiments were reverse transcription for 30 minutes at 48\u00a1\u00c6C, initial activation step for 10 minutes at 95\u00a1\u00c6C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation for 15 seconds at 95\u00a1\u00c6C and annealing/extension for 60 seconds at 60\u00a1\u00c6C. Fluorescence data were collected during the annealing step and analyzed using the Sequence Detection System 1.7 software (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression was determined based on corresponding threshold cycle values according to the ABI description in the TaqMan Protocol (TaqMan Cytokine Gene Expression Plate 1 protocol; Applied Biosystems). Variability among runs was controlled by use of a standardized sample in each run. Pooled normal pancreatic tissue was used as control and reference values. Sensitivity to Anti-Shh Treatment. Intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma xenograft mice were treated with Shh pathway inhibitors, 300-\u00a5\u00ecg 5E1 sc (anti-Shh antibody), 0.6-mg intraperitoneal cyclopamine (Smoothened inhibitor), and 75-\u00a5\u00ecg intraperitoneal forskolin (Gli antagonist). Xenograft mice carrying tumors approximately 350 \u00a5\u00ecL in size were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups with 5 animals in each group. All therapies were administered by daily injections for 7 days. Control animals received normal saline. Treatment response was determined by tumor volume change, tumor proliferation by immunohistochemistry (Ki-67 staining), and the extension of fibrosis and necrosis by percentage of viable glands (viable gland density). RESULTS. Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm Xenograft Tumors Preserved the Phenotype of the Primary Tumor. Histological examination of the resected primary tumor revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of gastric subtype, arising from a main duct IPMN (Figs. 1A?C). From this primary, a xenograft tumor line was successfully established. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of xenograft tumors revealed that xenografts preserved the characteristic histological attributes of the parent tumor (Fig. 1D). Histological condition remained stable over 4 generations of mice. Thus, xenografts preserved the phenotype of the primary tumor over several mouse passages. Mutational Analysis of KRAS and p53. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is known for its signature progression model, with an early dependence on KRAS mutations and a high incidence of p53 mutations. 29 However, little is known about the significance of these genetic aberrations in IPMC. To determine whether xenografted murine IPMCs bear similar signaling mutations, we performed sequence analysis. Direct sequencing of isolated xenograft tumor DNA showed the presence of a mutation in codon 12 of exon 2 of the KRAS gene (GGT>GTT) changing the amino acid sequence from glycine to valine; codon 13 remained unchanged. Furthermore, p53 evaluation showed a mutation involving codon 273 (CGT>TGT) of exon 8, which changed the sequence from arginine to cysteine. In contrast, the exons 5, 6, 7, and 9 were unchanged and showed wild-type sequences. These same genetic changes were identified in later mouse passages, suggesting minimal genetic drift. Thus, invasive adenocarcinoma arising in IPMN shares some mutational similarities with PDAC. Histologically and genetically, furthermore, the xenografts seem to faithfully recapitulate the human tumor and preserve these characteristics over the course of several mouse passages. Cell Culture. A cell line was established that was derived from an IPMC specimen (Supplementary Fig. 1, for the IPMC cell culture, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/MPA/A15). Tumor growth occurred after a few days. The doubling time in cell culture was 32 hours in the phase of exponential growth. Molecular analysis of DNA isolated from the cell culture showed the presence of the mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS gene (GGT>GTT; Gly>Val; Supplementary Fig. 2, for the KRAS mutation at codon 12, Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/MPA/A16), which was present in the DNA of the xenograft tumors and the parent tumor. To confirm that these cells preserve tumorigenic potential, approximately 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cultured cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank of an immunodeficient nude mouse, resulting in tumor growth. The resulting xenograft tumor was harvested and histological examination result showed the features of the parent IPMC specimen. Karyotyping. Karyotyping of the novel IPMC cell culture was performed. GTG-banding of 14 cells revealed an essentially tetraploid karyotype with multiple chromosomal aberrations. Recurrent numerical changes and aberrations were observed in addition to nonclonal changes. Karyotypes of 5 representative cells were assessed. Some of the chromosomal aberrations were recurrent, whereas others were single changes. Results of one representative cell were as follows (Fig. 2): X,?X,?Y,?Y,?3,?4,+5,?6,?6,?8,?9,+10,?11,?12,idic(12)(p13),?13,?13,add(13)(p13),?14,?15,add(15),?17,?17,?17,?17,?18,?18,?19,?19,+20, +del(20)(q11.2)\u00a1\u00bf2,?22,+mar1,+mar2. In summary, all karyotypes examined shared the following abnormalities: ?4, ?6, ?8, ?17, and ?18. Array CGH Reveals Multiple Copy Number Changes. To evaluate copy number changes below the detection limit of karyotyping, we performed array CGH on IPMC xenografts (Fig. 3). Array CGH has become a powerful tool to examine chromosomal abnormalities in human tissues with high resolution. This technique allows us to detect chromosomal gains and losses and identify potential tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes that might play a role in the development of neoplastic changes in malignant tumors. To exclude potential artifacts derived from murine mesenchyme, which might hybridize to the array, normal mouse liver DNA was used as control. Hybridizing mouse DNA to the (human) array platform, no losses or gains of larger chromosomal regions were found, indicating that the copy number changes detected in xenografts were real and not attributable to mouse mesenchyme contamination. Using array CGH in xenograft DNA, we found chromosomal gains at 3q, 5p, 9p, 18p, and 19q, whereas single-copy losses involved chromosomes 4, 5q, 6q, distal 6p, 8p, 9q, 12p13.1?13.33, 13q, 14q, 15q, 17p, 18q, 19p, and 21. Chromosomal losses included regions of several known tumor suppressor genes such as APC (chromosome 5q21?q22), Pth (chromosome 9q22.3), BRCA2 (chromosome 13q12.3), RB1 (chromosome 13q14.1?q14.2), p53 (chromosome 17p13.1), SMAD 4 (chromosome 18q21.1), and DCC (chromosome 18q21.3), suggesting that these genes play a role in neoplastic changes in IPMNs. No homozygous deletions were found with array CGH. The abnormalities we found for this cell line using array CGH were similar to those found using karyotyping but involved more specific regions (?4, ?6q, ?6p distal, ?8p, ?17p, and ?18q). Real-Time Quantitative PCR for Shh Pathway Signaling. In addition to mutations of tumor suppressor genes, Shh misexpression and subsequent hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation are believed to play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of PDAC. 30 However, to date, the role of Shh in the development of adenocarcinoma arising in IPMNs is poorly understood. To determine whether the Hh pathway eventually plays a role in malignant changes in IPMNs, we investigated whether it is overexpressed in IPMC xenografts. Compared with normal pancreatic tissue, Shh pathway members were found by reverse transcriptase PCR to be over-expressed in the IPMC xenograft tumors examined (Fig. 4). The Shh ligand was overexpressed with an average of 634.3-fold. Furthermore, there was overexpression of hedgehog pathway members: receptors Ptch1, Ptch2, and Smo were elevated an average of 436.7-, 56-, and 93.3-fold, respectively. In addition, the Hh target gene Gli2 was overexpressed 2606-fold compared with a pool of normal pancreatic control DNA. Thus, Shh overexpression and subsequent Hh pathway activation were observed in xenografts derived from IPMC. Sensitivity to Anti-Shh Treatment. To determine whether the Shh pathway is important for maintenance and growth of IPMCs, xenografted tumors were treated with targeted anti-Shh therapy. The Shh pathway was attacked on 3 different levels: with 5E1 (against the ligand), cyclopamine (against Smo), and forskolin (against Gli). Treatment with 5E1 and forskolin resulted in a significant (P = 0.007 and P = 0.049, respectively) reduction in tumor growth compared with controls (Fig. 5). Treatment with cyclopamine also led to marked tumor growth reduction; however, this reduction did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.17). Besides the reduction in tumor growth, all treatments (5E1, cyclopamine, and forskolin) resulted into a highly significant (P < 0.001) reduction in proliferative cells and viable gland density (Fig. 5). In summary, all tumors derived from the IPMC xenograft tumor line were highly sensitive to Shh pathway inhibition. Thus, Shh is an important factor for tumor growth and survival in IPMC that is similar to its role in PDAC. DISCUSSION. Compared with PDAC, 17-19 IPMC seems to have a less aggressive biological behavior, with subsequent improved survival. On the molecular level, significant differences between IPMC and PDAC have been reported. 24,25 However, in contrast to the great number of models available for the more common PDAC, 26,31,32 to our knowledge, no cell cultures or xenograft lines have been created from IPMC. In the present study, we investigate a novel cellular model for IPMC and evaluate the role of the Shh pathway in tumor maintenance and growth. Using array CGH, we identify a number of chromosomal losses, including known tumor suppressor genes such as APC, BRCA2, RB1, p53, and SMAD4. It is likely that these genes play a role in the neoplastic changes of IPMNs. Furthermore, xenograft tumors were found to be dependent on the Shh pathway for survival and proliferation. 30 Xenografts up-regulate this tumor pathway, and inhibition results in significant reduction of tumor growth, proliferation, and viable gland density. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use xenografts to investigate chemotherapies in IPMCs. The present molecular model of IPMC allows a better understanding of specific cellular characteristics in this type of tumor. Furthermore, it permits investigation of molecular and genetic features in changeable environments in vitro and in vivo. Although patients with IPMC show better survival than patients with its counterpart, PDAC, 6,10-16 the latter remains a potentially deadly disease; approximately 30% of patients undergoing curative surgery die within a 5-year period, 2,13,14,21-23 mainly from metastatic disease. Before entering clinical development, chemotherapeutics are usually tested in commercially available cell lines followed by xenograft models established from these lines. Xenografted tumors are considered to maintain their fundamental genotypic features despite serial passages and to represent the genetic heterogeneity of the primary tumor. 26 Thus, the novel IPMC xenograft model and cell line model presented here not only provide insight into molecular mechanisms involved in neoplastic changes in IPMCs but may also serve as a platform for testing cancer drug treatments in vivo.

                "text": "MDM2 antagonists boost antitumor effect of androgen withdrawal: implications for therapy of prostate cancer\tBackground. Hormone therapy is the standard of care for newly diagnosed or recurrent prostate cancers. It uses anti-androgen agents, castration, or both to eliminate cancer promoting effect of testicular androgen. The p53 tumor suppressor controls a major pathway that can block cell proliferation or induce apoptosis in response to diverse forms of oncogenic stress. Activation of the p53 pathway in cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 has been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy and recently developed MDM2 antagonists, the nutlins, have validated this in preclinical models of cancer. The crosstalk between p53 and androgen receptor (AR) signaling suggest that p53 activation could augment antitumor outcome of androgen ablation in prostate cancer. Here, we test this hypothesis in vitro and in vivo using the MDM2 antagonist, nutlin-3 and the p53 wild-type prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. Results. Using charcoal-stripped serum as a cellular model of androgen deprivation, we show an increased apoptotic effect of p53 activation by nutlin-3a in the androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and to a lesser extent in androgen-independent but responsive 22Rv1 cell line. This effect is due, at least in part, to an enhanced downregulation of AR expression by activated p53. In vivo, androgen deprivation followed by two weeks of nutlin administration in LNCaP-bearing nude mice led to a greater tumor regression and dramatically increased survival. Conclusions. Since majority of prostate tumors express wild-type p53, its activation by MDM2 antagonists in combination with androgen depletion may offer an efficacious new approach to prostate cancer therapy. Background. Despite advances in diagnostics and treatment, prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the US. Current treatments attempt to block cancer cell growth and induce cell death by removing or inhibiting the androgens that support tumor growth [1]. Surgical (orchiectomy) or chemical (LHRH agonist/antagonist) castration to eliminate testicular- androgen can delay clinical progression [2]. Anti-androgens such as flutamide or the more potent bicalutamide, which block the hormone-receptor interaction, have also been shown to improve survival [3-5]. Combined androgen blockade (CAB) applies both castration and anti-androgens, or estrogens to maximize the block on androgens including those produced from the adrenal gland. However, survival benefit from CAB is rather controversial and still under scrutiny [1]. Unfortunately, the majority of prostate cancer patients will eventually become resistant to one or all of these therapeutic strategies. The mechanisms behind the resistance to androgen deprivation are not well understood although existing experimental evidence suggest that androgen withdrawal predominantly induces a cessation of cell proliferation but not overt apoptosis. In vitro studies with LNCaP cells grown in charcoal-stripped serum to mimic androgen ablation show a decrease in proliferation without apoptosis [6]. This is unlikely due to ineffective androgen removal because a recent study has indicated that tissue culture media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) contain castrate levels of testosterone and the level of androgen is well below serum levels of castrated males [7]. Normal rat prostate (and likely normal human prostate gland) respond to androgen ablation with high levels of apoptosis leading to glandular involution [8-10]. However, in human prostate cancer cells, the apoptotic response to androgen deprivation is not as clearly evident. It has been shown that androgen deprivation induces cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis in three well known androgen-dependent cell lines, LNCaP, CWR22, and LuCaP-35 in vitro and in vivo [6,11,12]. Eventually, cell proliferation resumes, leading to an androgen-independent state in these model systems in vivo. This makes them a good model to assess the ability of therapeutics to induce cell death in combination with androgen ablation. The molecular response to in vivo androgen withdrawal was studied closely in the human prostate cancer xenograft model CWR22 in nude mice. Androgen ablation induced a robust stress response with an apparent p53-mediated cell cycle arrest but no p53-dependent apoptosis. Additionally the increased expression of p53 was only transient [11,13]. Lastly, studies of human tumor samples taken from patients that have undergone androgen deprivation show significant decreases in proliferation but minimal apoptotic index [9,10,14]. The p53 protein is a potent tumor suppressor that can induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to various forms of cellular stress [15]. Under non-stressed conditions, p53 is tightly controlled by its negative regulator MDM2 via an autoregulatory feedback loop [16,17]. p53 activates the transcription of the mdm2 gene and in turn MDM2 protein inhibits p53 transcriptional activity. In addition, MDM2 is a p53-specific E3 ligase which targets p53 for ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome [18]. As a result of proper functioning of this autoregulatory loop both p53 and MDM2 are kept at low levels. In response to stress, the cellular levels of p53 increase leading to activation of multiple target genes and the p53 pathway with its main functions: cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [15,19]. These antitumor consequences make p53 a desirable target for pharmacological activation [20]. In addition to its role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, p53 has also been implicated in the regulation of AR [21]. Although the mechanism by which p53 exerts its control over AR is not clearly understood, p53 over-expression has been shown to decrease androgen function apparently by reduction in the expression of androgen-dependent genes [22,23]. However, this regulation is quite complex given that at physiological levels p53 may act to protect androgen signaling [21]. Conversely, androgen signaling has been found attenuated in etoposide-treated LNCaP cells as the stabilized p53 binds to the AR gene promoter [24]. Hence, p53 could facilitate the reduction of AR signaling by occupying and competing for AR promoter. A recent study has also implicated p53 negative regulator MDM2 in modulation of AR protein levels by targeting it for ubiquitin-dependent degradation [25]. We have demonstrated that a potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 binding, nutlin-3a, can stabilize p53 and activate the p53 pathway in a broad panel of wild-type tumor lines including prostate [26,27]. By disrupting p53-MDM2 regulatory circuit, nutlin elevates not only p53 but also MDM2, a transcription target of p53. Although MDM2 is kept away from p53, nutlin-bound MDM2 retains its E3 ligase activity against itself and possibly other targets. It has been documented that elevated MDM2 can facilitate MDMX ubiquitination and degradation in the presence of nutlin [28]. Therefore, one can expect that nutlin-induced elevated MDM2 could also facilitate AR degradation and further reduce AR levels when combined with androgen ablation. Here, we show that activation of the p53 pathway by nutlin-3a substantially augments the antitumor effect of androgen ablation. In vitro, combination of nutlin-3a with androgen deprivation in prostate cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 led to an increase in apoptosis over single agent treatments. More significantly, combination treatment of mice bearing LNCaP xenografts resulted in frequent complete tumor regressions and a dramatic increase in lifespan. Results. Nutlin-3a activates the p53 pathway in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. To study the combined effect of p53 activation and androgen deprivation, we chose the androgen-depenedent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP as a cellular model. We have shown previously that nutlin-3a activates p53 and inhibits the growth of LNCaP cells and xenograft tumors in nude mice [27]. Incubation of proliferating LNCaP cells with nutlin-3a for 5 days showed a dose-dependent effect with EC 50 of 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecM (Figure ?(Figure1A).1A). Western blot analysis following 24 h nutlin treatment revealed p53 accumulation and concurrent increases in its transcriptional targets MDM2 and p21 Waf1/CIP1 (Figure ?(Figure1B).1B). Additionally, BrdU cell cycle analysis showed a loss of S-phase and increase of G1 and G2/M phase fractions consistent with p53-mediated cell cycle block in G1 and G2 phases (Figure ?(Figure1C).1C). To assess the apoptotic activity of nutlin-3a we used the Annexin V assay. Nutlin showed both a dose-dependant and time-dependant increase in the apoptotic fraction (Figure ?(Figure1D).1D). These results confirm that MDM2 antagonists stabilize p53 protein in LNCaP cells and effectively activate p53 signaling and the main p53 functions, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Nutlin treatment in combination with androgen deprivation further reduces AR levels and enhances apoptosis. In addition to the androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, two other prostate cancer cell lines were chosen to investigate the combination effect of androgen ablation and p53 activation: 22Rv1 and DU145. Wild-type p53 expressing 22Rv1 cells have an androgen responsive AR but can grow independent of androgen in vivo. DU145 cells that express mutant p53 were used as a negative control since MDM2 antagonists require wild-type p53 for their cellular activity [26]. Cells were incubated in media containing either normal serum or charcoal-stripped serum (CSS) which has been shown to effectively eliminate androgen and thus mimic androgen ablation [7]. A suboptimal nutlin-3a dose of 5 \u00a5\u00ecM was used (Figure ?(Figure1D).1D). Cells were also treated with 5 \u00a5\u00ecM of the anti-androgen hydroxy-flutamide (FLU) in the presence of complete or CSS. Western blot analysis of LNCaP cells revealed that CSS in combination with nutlin elicits further reduction of AR levels than CSS alone in LNCaP cells and to a lesser extent in 22Rv1 cells (Figure 2A-B). Both LNCaP and 22Rv1 expressed full- length AR (110 kDa and 114 kDa respectively), 22Rv1 also expressed a 80 kDa isoform. Analysis of the AR mRNA levels in LNCaP cells by quantitative PCR revealed a 2-fold decrease in the presence of nutlin or CSS but no significant change in the combination (data not shown). Stabilization of p53 and subsequent increases in p21 and MDM2 levels were only observed in the presence of nutlin but not CSS indicating that CSS does not cause stress-related p53 activation. Then, we examined the apoptotic response after 48 hour drug treatment (Figure ?(Figure2).2). While CSS did not induce apoptosis over the control level in LNCaP cells, the combination with nutlin enhanced the apoptosis observed with nutlin alone (Figure ?(Figure2A).2A). Flutamide did not show a significant change in apoptosis. However, the triple combination (Nutlin + CSS + FLU) further increased the apoptotic index in LNCaP but not in 22Rv1 cells (Figure ?(Figure2B).2B). As expected, the p53-mutant and AR-negative line DU145 did not show an increase in p21 and MDM2. AR levels were also undetectable and no significant change in apoptotic fractions observed (Figure ?(Figure2C2C). Bicalutamide (Casodex) enhances apoptotic activity of Nutlin-3a in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Exponentially growing LNCaP, 22Rv1, and DU145 were incubated with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM of another clinically used anti-androgen, Casodex (CDX), and/or 5 \u00a5\u00ecM Nutlin-3a in the presence of complete serum or CSS. Percent apoptosis was determined by Annexin V staining after 48 hours (Figure ?(Figure3).3). Data revealed that combined treatment with Nutlin-3a and CDX was more effective at inducing apoptosis than single agent treatments in both LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. However, the combination of Nutlin-3a and CDX was less effective than Nutlin + CSS combination in LNCaP cells while triple treatment showed slight improvement over Nutlin + CSS combination. Nutlin + CDX combination showed a slightly better activity than Nutlin + CSS in 22Rv1 and triple treatment did not demonstrate greater effect over dual in this cell line. AR reduction accounts for the increased apoptotic activity of nutlin-3a in CSS. To further investigate if the apoptosis enhancing effect of CSS is due to AR reduction, we depleted AR in LNCaP cells grown in normal serum using AR-specific siRNA. Western blotting confirmed the effective reduction of AR and showed that only in the presence of nutlin was there stabilization of p53 and activation of its transcription targets, p21 and MDM2 (Figure ?(Figure4A).4A). Addition of nutlin to AR-depleted LNCaP (siRNA-AR) cells led to a substantial increase in the apoptotic cell fraction over nutlin alone (Figure ?(Figure4B).4B). We then combined siRNA-AR and CSS with or without nutlin (Figure ?(Figure4C).4C). Apoptotic fraction of LNCaP cells in CSS + nutlin was nearly equivalent to the triple combination (CSS + siRNA-AR + nutlin), implying that CSS effectively reduces AR levels and that this is the main mechanistic cause for enhanced apoptotic response. Nutlin-induced AR reduction does not involve MDM2-dependant degradation. MDM2 has been shown to serve as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 and several other proteins, most notably MDMX [28]. Moreover, AR degradation by Akt has been reported to require the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 [25]. Since nutlin treatment leads to a dramatic elevation of MDM2 protein one can expect facilitated degradation of AR, if nutlin-bound MDM2 can retain its activity against AR as previously shown with another MDM2 target, MDMX [28]. To test this possibility, we examined the protein levels of MDM2 and MDMX in the presence or absence of nutlin and/or CSS (Figure ?(Figure5A).5A). Nutlin treatment dramatically increased MDM2 levels and led to a significant reduction of MDMX but did not change AR protein levels. The reduction of MDMX was due to enhanced protein degradation since the proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored its levels. These results indicate that either MDM2 cannot facilitate AR degradation in LNCaP cells or that it has lost its activity against AR when in complex with the small-molecule inhibitor nutlin-3a. To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated a LNCaP cell clone stably expressing high levels of full length MDM2 protein under a CMV promoter. Western blot analysis showed significantly reduced levels of MDMX similar to nutlin-treatment. AR was also reduced but to a lesser extent. These experiments confirmed the previous observation that MDM2 protein can affect AR protein levels [25] and suggest that this ability is likely lost when nutlin-3a is bound to the MDM2 protein. Androgen deprivation does not affect nutlin-induced miR-34 expression. Recently, Rokhin at al. reported that LNCaP cells cultured in androgen-free media and then treated with the DNA-damaging agent, doxorubicin, suppressed the expression of p53 transcription targets miR-34a and miR-34c, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis [29]. It has been shown previously that nutlin activates miR-34(a-c) expression [30]. Therefore, we examined if the combination of nutlin and CSS can affect miR-34 levels. Exponentially proliferating LNCaP cells were incubated in CSS, 5 \u00a5\u00ecM nutlin-3a, or combination of both for 24 h, and miR-34(a, b and c) levels were measured by quantitive PCR. We found significant induction of all three miRNA species by nutlin (34a:4.4, 34b:35.8, 34c:36.4 fold average) and less than 2 \u00a1\u00bf fold increase in the presence of CSS. However, the combination did not significantly change the levels of any of the three miR over nutlin alone (data not shown). These experiments suggest that androgen deprivation does not affect miR-34 induction by non-genotoxic p53 activation. Nutlin-3a enhances antitumor activity of androgen deprivation in vivo and substantially increases lifespan of nude mice. Finally, we examined if androgen ablation combined with nutlin-3a could enhance anti-tumor activity against established human prostate tumor xenografts (Figure ?(Figure6A).6A). To this end, pre-castrated nude mice were implanted with sustained-release testosterone pellets 5 days prior to injection of LNCaP cells. Tumors were fully established with an average starting tumor volume of approximately 400 mm 3 in each group. Mice were administered an optimal oral dose of nutlin-3a at 200 mg/kg twice a day (bid) for 14 days. Others were treated with removal of testosterone pellets as a model of androgen ablation. Additional mice were treated with a combination of ablation + nutlin-3a. Control mice were dosed with vehicle + sham pellet removal. Nutlin was well tolerated in all groups with no significant body weight loss in any group throughout the study. Tumor regressions were observed in all groups relative to vehicle. Nutlin-treated animals had 6/10 partial regressions, androgen ablation caused 20/20 partial regressions, and combination of nutlin + ablation yielded 13/20 partial regressions including 7/20 complete regressions (no complete regressions were observed in the other groups). At day 42 post tumor cell inoculation (last day of nutlin treatment), measurement of prostate specific androgen (PSA) in serum showed a 68% decrease with nutlin treatment alone compared to vehicle control (Figure ?(Figure6B).6B). Androgen ablation and combination treatment reduced serum PSA levels 94% and 98%, respectively. Based on NCI criteria, an increase in lifespan (ILS) of \u00a1\u00c325% is biologically significant [31]. Twice daily dosing of nutlin-3a produced a 57% ILS and androgen deprivation gave a 167% ILS (Figure ?(Figure6C).6C). Although the difference in tumor volume at day 42 between androgen deprivation and combination treatment was only 6-fold (Figure ?(Figure6A),6A), over time, nutlin + androgen deprivation resulted in a greater than 886% ILS. This was the result of the majority of regressions never re-growing and the mice therefore died of perceived natural causes (no gross signs of primary subcutaneous tumor or metastasis upon necropsy in all cases). Collectively, our results demonstrate a clear benefit of administering nutlin-3a in conjunction with androgen ablation. Discussion. Although androgen withdrawal/deprivation is the predominant course of treatment for advanced prostate cancer, eventually all patients will develop resistance to this therapy. Moreover, the mechanism underlying hormone refractory disease progression has yet to be elucidated. Our in vivo data supports the conclusion that ablation elicits an impressive yet transient antitumor effect in concordance with early clinical response. However, akin to long term clinical results, our xenograft data shows that over time androgen deprivation does not result in sustained regressions (Figure ?(Figure6C).6C). Disappointingly, clinical results also show that most if not all advanced prostate cancers become androgen independent after surgical or chemical castration [1]. Taken together, these observations provide credence to the notion that ablation predominantly acts as an anti-proliferative rather than strong pro-apoptotic modality [11,14,32]. Further complicating matters is the apparent heterogeneity of advanced prostate tumors [33,34]. Taking this into account, initial anti-androgen therapy may simply eliminate a modest portion of a genetically-diverse androgen-dependant tumor cell population and provide selective pressure to the remaining malignancy that favors growth of new or pre-existing androgen-independent cell populations [35-37]. Although the requirement for androgen is no longer necessary in refractory disease the AR can still potentiate tumor growth and survival, thus activity of the AR remains a focal point of therapy even in advanced stages of androgen independent prostate cancer [38-40]. It is also evident that there are numerous mechanisms by which aberrant androgen signaling occurs in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Examples include AR hypersensitivity via gene amplification, changes in ligand specificity via mutation, increases in AR gene expression or androgen biosynthesis, all of which permit growth advantages in low androgen environments [37,40]. It is therefore imperative when using model systems to take into account the cellular milieu in which the AR exists. The LNCaP line used in this study for example, harbors the mutation T877A in the ligand binding domain. The consequence of this mutation is a loss of ligand specificity and promiscuous activation of AR with progestins, estrogens, adrenal androgens and surprisingly some anti-androgens.[37,38,41]. Consistent with published data, the androgen independent yet responsive 22Rv1 line show two mutant forms of the AR: a 114-kDa full-length form containing an exon-3 duplication and a truncated 80 kDa form which lacks the ligand binding domain ([42] and Figure ?Figure2B).2B). In addition, the AR in 22Rv1 cells contains a His 874 to Tyr substitution that also permits stimulation by adrenal androgens albeit likely through a different mechanism than the T877A substitution in LNCaP cells [43]. Nevertheless, it is the AR that appears to be the principal accomplice in progressing towards complete androgen-independence [38-40]. Recent evidence suggests that the androgen receptor can confer cell survival by negatively regulating pro-apoptotic genes in the p53 pathway [41]. Moreover, overexpression of wild-type AR in LAPC4 or mutant AR in LNCaP lines can promote cell survival by inhibiting p53 mediated apoptosis [44]. Additionally, the potent androgen Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) has also been shown to decrease p53 levels and inhibit apoptosis in a dose dependent manner [45]. Alternatively, AR expression can be diminished by increased levels of p53 [24]. Highlighting the complex interplay between AR and p53 expression is the observation that physiological levels of p53 may be necessary to stabilize AR signaling [21]. Interestingly, LNCaP cells cultured in steroid-free media decreased both p53 protein and mRNA levels equal to that of treatment with high concentration of DHT. However, p53 knockdown in LNCaP cells have shown no change in AR levels regardless of DHT [45]. Taken together these findings suggest a mutual regulation of expression between p53 and AR. Therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting the delicate cross-talk between AR and p53 must not only favor p53 expression, but also potentiate the apoptotic outcome of p53 activation. Our published [27] and current data demonstrates that nutlin-3a alone has potent activity in the LNCaP cell line and in LNCaP xenograft models. As expected, nutlin-3a effectively activated the p53 pathway indicated by the increased expression of transcriptional targets, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Figure ?(Figure1).1). These changes were not observed with CSS treatment and support the notion that androgen withdrawal by CSS does not cause stress-induced p53 activation. It is important to note that media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) does not represent normal physiological levels of testosterone but rather contain levels that are equivalent to that of serum in adult castrated males, nonetheless, LNCaP cells are able to maintain ~10 nM intracellular DHT concentration in 10% FCS by optimizing their AR and androgen metabolism [7]. Thus LNCaP cultured in CSS is exposed to testosterone levels significantly lower than that measured in serum from castrated adult males [7]. Unsurprisingly, we observed a discernible reduction in the expression of AR when LNCaP were cultured in CSS as opposed to FCS. Treatment with nutlin alone resulted in a relatively small decrease in AR protein levels (Figure ?(Figure2B)2B) likely reflecting the decrease of its mRNA levels. Greater reduction in AR protein occurred with concurrent nutlin and CSS treatment. This further reduction is not accounted for by the decrease in transcription or direct effect of elevated MDM2 on AR stability. This change may result from a complex set of events induced by activated p53 in an androgen-depleted milieu. Combination of nutlin and CSS enhaced the apoptotic response in LNCaP and to a lesser extent in 22Rv1 cells in vitro. (Figure ?(Figure2).2). Presence of AR mutations in LNCaP and 22RV1 cells is likely responsible for the lack of robust in vitro response to flutamide as reported previously [38,41]. However, the second generation AR antagonist, casidex, did show clear in vitro effect. The decrease in AR protein levels appear to play a key role in the enhanced apoptotic response since siRNA-mediated knockdown of AR augmented apoptotic effect of nutlin similar to the combination with CSS. The mechanism behind the enhanced apoptosis in an AR-depleted environment is not entirely clear. One experimentally supported possibility is that AR activation attenuates p53-dependent apoptotic signaling [41,44] and efficient removal of AR expression leads to an overwhelming response in favor of cell death and not just cellular arrest. In vivo, the combination of androgen ablation with nutlin treatment resulted in greater efficacy over corresponding monotherapy arms in established LNCaP xenografts and was the only group to show complete regressions in 7/20 mice despite the relatively high initial tumor volume (400 mm 3). The greater degree of regression ultimately resulted in a dramatic increase of survival rates for the combination (Figure ?(Figure6C).6C). Taken together our data supports the notion that androgen withdrawal alone fails to induce a durable apoptotic response thereby allowing the eventual escape towards androgen independence. Conclusions. The administration of nutlin with androgen deprivation offers a novel two-pronged approach to cancer therapy in which factors that sustain prostate tumor growth are effectively removed with a simultaneous unleashing of the powerful growth suppressive and pro-apoptotic activity of p53. As increasingly more potent anti-androgens are identified (e.g. abiraterone acetate and MDV3100 [46]), their combination with MDM2 antagonists, currently in Phase I clinical development, could offer a compelling strategy in future trials. Methods. Cells, reagents and treatment. All cell lines used in this study were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and grown in the recommended media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a humidified environment with 5% CO 2. Nutlin-3a was synthesized at Hoffmann-La Roche Inc, (Nutley, NJ). It was dissolved in DMSO and kept at -20\u00a1\u00c6C as 10 mM stock solution. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Hydroxy-flutamide was dissolved in ethanol and maintained at 4\u00a1\u00c6C at 10 mM stock concentration and used within 10 days. Bicalutamide was dissolved in DMSO and kept at 4\u00a1\u00c6C as a 10 mM stock solution. MG132 was dissolved in DMSO and kept at -20\u00a1\u00c6C in 10 mM aliquots. Cells were treated with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM MG132 for 8 h prior to collection. For experiments in charcoal stripped serum (CSS) cells were washed with PBS and pre-incubated for 5 minutes in phenol free media with 10% CSS, washed again and replenished with phenol-free media containing 10% CSS with or without compound. The LNCaP-MDM2 overexpressing line was generated using the human full length MDM2 inserted into phCMV1 vector. The control is the empty phCMV1 and the selection marker is G418 at 250 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml. Assays. Cell proliferation/viability was evaluated by the tetrazolium dye (MTT) assay [47] as previously described [26]. For cell cycle analysis, LNCaP cells (1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells/T75 flask) were incubated with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM nutlin-3a for 24 h. BrdU (20 \u00a5\u00ecM; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added during the last 1 h prior to fixation and cells were processed and analyzed as previously described [27]. For apoptosis assays, cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates at 2.5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 (22Rv1 & DU145) or 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 (LNCaP) per well and treated for 48 h or as indicated. The percentage of Annexin V-positive cells was determined as described [27]. For qRT-PCR analysis, cells were seeded in 6-well plates, incubated overnight and treated with DMSO or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM nutlin-3a for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed as described previously [28]. To quantify microRNA expression, total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol solution (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instruction. 10 ng of RNA was converted to cDNA using the TaqMan \u00a2\u00e7 microRNA Transcription Kit and real-time PCR analysis was performed using TaqMan \u00a2\u00e7 microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems). For Western blotting, cells were grown in 75 cm 2 flasks (10 6 cells per flask) or in duplicate in 6 well plates for siRNA experiments, lysed in 0.1 -0.2 ml RIPA buffer and analyzed as previously described [27]. For siRNA experiments, human-specific AR SMARTpool siRNAs and non-targeting control siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon RNAi Technologies (Lafayette, CO) and used as previously described [28]. Animals Studies. Precastrated male athymic nude mice (Crl:NU-Foxn1nu) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, DE) and cared for as previously described [27]. At 10 weeks of age, mice were implanted with a 12.5 mg sustained-release testosterone pellet (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) 5 days before the injection of tumor cells. A 1:1 mixture of human LNCaP prostate cancer cells suspended in phenol-free Matrigel and PBS were implanted in the right flank at a concentration of 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 7 cells in 0.2 ml total volume. The health of all animals was monitored daily by gross observation and analyses of blood samples of sentinel animals. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in our AAALAC accredited facility. Four weeks after inoculation, mice were assigned to different treatment groups with average tumor volume approximately 400 mm 3. Mice were administered Nutlin-3a at 200 mg/kg bid (n = 10) orally for 14 days in 0.2 ml volume per injection or testosterone pellets were removed under ketamine/xylazine cocktail anesthesia to simulate androgen Ablation (AA) (n = 20). Other mice were treated with a combination of AA + Nutlin-3a at 200 mg/kg bid orally for 14 days (n = 20). Control mice were dosed with 0.2 ml vehicle bid orally for 14 days + sham pellet removal under ketamine/xylazine cocktail anesthesia. Tumor measurements and weights were taken 2-3 times per week. Tumor growth inhibition was calculated from percent change in mean tumor volume compared to the control group. Average percent weight change was used as a surrogate endpoint for tolerability in the experiment. Five random mice in each group were bled via the retrorbital sinus under anesthesia to obtain serum for PSA determination using a PSA ELISA (American Qualex, Inc., San Clemente, CA). Ten animals in each group were continuously followed beyond the last day of nutlin treatment to see if tumor re-growth would occur. In this second phase of analysis, survival was calculated using a cut-off individual tumor volume of 1000 mm 3 as a surrogate for mortality. The increase in lifespan (ILS) was calculated as % using the formula: [(Median day of death in treated tumor-bearing mice) - (median day of death in control tumor-bearing mice)] \u00a1\u00bf 100 Median day of death in control tumor-bearing mice. Statistical analysis was performed as previously described [27]. Competing interests. The authors declare that they have no competing interests. Authors' contributions.

Matrix (M) protein mutants of VSV have shown greater selectivity for killing GBM cells versus normal brain cells than VSV with wild-type M protein. The goal of this research was to determine the contribution of death receptor and mitochondrial pathways to apoptosis induced by an M protein mutant (M51R) VSV in U87 human GBM tumor cells. Compared to controls, U87 cells expressing a dominant negative form of Fas (dnFas) or overexpressing Bcl-X L had reduced caspase-3 activation following infection with M51R VSV, indicating that both the death receptor pathway and mitochondrial pathways are important for M51R VSV-induced apoptosis. Death receptor signaling has been classified as type I or type II, depending on whether signaling is independent (type I) or dependent on the mitochondrial pathway (type II). Bcl-X L overexpression inhibited caspase activation in response to a Fas-inducing antibody, similar to the inhibition in response to M51R VSV infection, indicating that U87 cells behave as type II cells. Inhibition of apoptosis in vitro delayed, but did not prevent, virus-induced cell death. Murine xenografts of U87 cells that overexpress Bcl-X L regressed with a time course similar to that of control cells following treatment with M51R VSV, and tumors were not detectable at 21 days postinoculation. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated similar levels of viral antigen expression but reduced activation of caspase-3 following virus treatment of Bcl-X L-overexpressing tumors compared to controls. Further, the pathological changes in tumors following treatment with virus were quite different in the presence versus the absence of Bcl-X L overexpression. These results demonstrate that M51R VSV efficiently induces oncolysis in GBM tumor cells despite deregulation of apoptotic pathways, underscoring its potential use as a treatment for GBM. INTRODUCTION. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a well-studied negative-strand RNA virus that has been identified as a potential oncolytic virus therapy for brain tumors (29, 30, 51, 53). Oncolytic virus therapy is an emerging therapy for cancers that currently lack effective treatment (7, 11). Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a common and highly aggressive brain tumor that has a median survival of approximately 1 year once diagnosed (15). Thus, GBM is a cancer that is widely considered likely to benefit from oncolytic virus therapy. Several clinical trials of oncolytic viruses are ongoing or have already been conducted in patients with GBM (14, 30, 31, 33, 45, 56). To date, at least two VSV oncolytic viruses have been considered by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, a key step toward beginning clinical trials in a variety of cancer types (47, 48). The selectivity of VSV for cancerous versus normal tissue is due to defects in antiviral responses that cancers develop during tumorigenesis that make them more susceptible to virus infections (4, 5, 42, 43). The selectivity of oncolytic viruses for cancer cells can be enhanced by mutating viral genes involved in suppressing host antiviral responses, which renders these viruses nonpathogenic in normal tissues but effective as oncolytic agents in cancers that have downregulated their antiviral responses. In the case of VSV, the matrix (M) protein is responsible for inhibiting cellular antiviral responses through the general inhibition of host gene expression (2, 9, 10, 13, 43). Mutation of the M protein renders the virus unable to suppress antiviral responses in normal tissues but does not compromise the ability of the virus to replicate in cancers that are defective in their antiviral responses (1, 29, 43). The cancer selectivity of M protein mutant VSV compared to VSV with the wild-type (wt) M protein is illustrated by treatment of human cancer xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Viruses with wt or mutant M protein are similarly effective in reducing tumor burden. However, most immunodeficient mice treated with wt VSV succumb to virus infection, while those treated with M protein mutant virus show no signs of VSV-induced disease (1, 42, 43). One of the attractive features of VSV as an oncolytic agent is that it is highly cytopathic and induces cell death in nearly all productively infected cells. VSV is a potent inducer of death due to the activation of multiple apoptotic pathways (17, 23). It is important to determine which apoptotic pathways are most crucial for VSV-induced cell killing because many cancers differentially express proteins that regulate apoptosis. Understanding the apoptotic pathways induced by VSV will contribute to understanding the potential outcomes of oncolytic therapy with VSV. The goal of the experiments presented here was to determine the apoptotic pathways that are important for the killing of GBM cells by oncolytic M protein mutant VSV. Previous studies indicated that induction of apoptosis by M protein mutant VSV occurs through different pathways from those used by VSV with wt M protein. The inhibition of host gene expression by wt M protein primarily activates the mitochondrial pathway (6, 17, 22). In contrast, induction of apoptosis by M protein mutant VSV was shown to be mediated by transmembrane death receptors, such as Fas (16). Fas activation induces formation of an intracellular death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) that triggers activation of the initiator caspase-8, ultimately leading to apoptosis via activation of effector caspases such as caspase-3. However, the mitochondrial pathway may also be involved in some cell types (41, 46) since targeting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway with Bcl-2 inhibitors sensitizes primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells to an M protein mutant VSV-induced oncolysis (46). In some cell types, cross talk between the death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways is required for efficient induction of cell death. Death receptor signaling has been classified as type I or type II, depending on whether signaling is independent of the mitochondrial pathway (type I) or depends on amplification by the mitochondrial pathway (type II) (38, 39). The death receptor pathway can activate the mitochondrial pathway through caspase-8 cleavage of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bid. Cleaved Bid (truncated Bid [tBid]) then promotes destabilization of the mitochondria through activation of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins. Previous results from our laboratory indicated that activation of the mitochondrial pathway by wt VSV is due in part to the activity of Bid (35). This raises the question of whether cross talk through Bid can be an important mechanism of cell death induced by M protein mutant VSV. In results presented here, we show that human GBM cells require a type II death receptor pathway to undergo apoptosis in the presence of an oncolytic M protein mutant VSV, M51R VSV. Unexpectedly, inhibition of apoptosis by overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-X L had little if any effect on the time course of clearance of human GBM xenografts in immunodeficient mice following treatment with M51R VSV. However, the pathological changes in tumors following treatment with virus were quite different in the presence versus the absence of Bcl-X L overexpression. These results suggest that treatment of GBM tumors with M protein mutant VSV may overcome common mechanisms of cancer resistance to induction of apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS.  Cell lines and virus.. U87-MG cells (ATCC HTB-14, referred to here as U87 cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable cell lines were generated following the transfection of plasmid DNA using Effectene reagent (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pcDNA3-Bcl-X L and control pcDNA3 plasmids have been described previously (35). The pcDNA3.1(+)-puro-dnFas (where dnFas is a dominant negative form of Fas) plasmid was generated similarly to that described in Gaddy and Lyles (16), except that human cDNA was used as a template, and pcDNA3.1(+)-puro was used as the vector. The pIRES2-ZsGreen1-Bcl-X L (where ZsGreen is Zoanthus sp. green fluorescent protein and IRES2 is internal ribosome entry site 2) plasmid was generated by subcloning the Bcl-X L insert into the pIRES2-ZsGreen1-Lux plasmid. Cells stably transfected with the pcDNA3- or pcDNA3.1(+)-puro-derived plasmid were selected with 800 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml G418 or 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml puromycin, respectively. Clones were picked using sterile cloning discs. Polyclonal cells stably transfected with pIRES2-ZsGreen1-derived plasmids were sorted via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), based on the expression of the fluorescent ZsGreen1 protein. M51R VSV was isolated and grown as previously described (24). All cell culture infections were carried out under single-cycle infection conditions at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 PFU per cell.  Caspase activity assay.. Cells were seeded onto six-well plates at 60 to 80% confluence. At various times, cells were infected with M51R VSV or treated with a known inducer of apoptosis. Following infection, floating and attached cells were harvested, and cell lysates were prepared as described previously (50). The fluorogenic substrate DEVD-aminofluorocoumarin (DEVD-AFC; BioMol, Inc.) was added to lysates, and fluorescence was measured over the course of an hour at 37\u00a1\u00c6C using a BMG Labtech POLARstar Omega microplate reader. A protein assay (Bio-Rad) was performed concurrently.  Fas-activating antibody.. The Fas-activating antibody, ch.11 (Upstate), was used at a concentration of 1 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml in combination with a low dose of cycloheximide (CHX) (10 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml) as described previously (36).  Immunoblot analysis.. Cell lysates were prepared with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mM benzamidine. Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) using the Invitrogen NuPage system. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.5) containing 5% nonfat milk and then probed with antibodies against Bcl-X L (Cell Signaling Technologies), Bid (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as previously described (17). Band intensities were quantified by scanning and analysis using Quantity One (Bio-Rad) software.  Fluorescence microscopy.. Cells were seeded on BD Falcon 96-well clear-bottom imaging plates. Following infection with virus, cells were labeled with propidium iodide (PI; Invitrogen) and Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen) and were then imaged using a BD Pathway 855 instrument. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software and a macro kindly provided by Peter Antinozzi (Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University). Briefly, the number of pixels with intensity above the threshold established in mock-infected cells was determined for each wavelength, and the area of positive staining was measured for each well. The ratio of the PI-positive area to Hoechst-positive area was then calculated for each well. This ratio is approximately equal to the fraction of total cells that are PI positive without the complication of observer bias and with the advantage that all of the cells in the well are analyzed, reducing the variability associated with analyzing a limited number of microscopic fields.  Cell viability assay.. Cell viability was assessed by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2 2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell viability was evaluated, and survival was estimated relative to untreated controls as described previously (23, 35).  RNA interference.. U87 cells were transiently transfected with 15 nM Bid small interfering RNA (siRNA) or control siRNA-A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Dharmafect 4 (Thermo Fisher, Dharmacon) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis in order to assess the quality of siRNA transfection.  Time-lapse microscopy.. Cells were seeded at approximately 60 to 70% confluence on 24-well dishes. Time-lapse microscopy was performed as described previously (35). Infections were allowed to progress through 48 h.  Subcutaneous tumor model.. U87 cells transfected with pIRES2-ZsGreen1-Bcl-X L or pIRES2-ZsGreen1-Lux were harvested from semiconfluent cultures. Cells were resuspended at 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells/0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and for each transgenic cell line, cells were subcutaneously injected in the right, hind-flank of 12 female nude (nu/nu) mice (six mice per treatment group). Animals were monitored for tumor development and weighed daily. Animals with palpable tumors had their tumor volume measured with calipers, and the volume was calculated as follows: volume = (width) 2 \u00a1\u00bf length/2. After 1 week, palpable tumors developed (50 to 100 mm 3), and each animal was injected intravenously (i.v.) twice, 3 days apart, with either M51R VSV (1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 7 PFU) or PBS. Mice were sacrificed when the tumor size approached the predetermined upper size limit of 1,000 mm 3 or 3 weeks after injection with M51R VSV or PBS. The mice were sacrificed at this time in order to determine whether there was residual tumor or signs of VSV-induced pathology. The tumor site and selected tissues (brain, spleen, and lungs) were harvested for histological analysis.  Immunohistochemistry.. Tumors generated as described above were harvested 2 days after treatment with M51R VSV or PBS and were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 \u00a5\u00ecm. Tissue sections were immunostained for VSV glycoprotein as described previously (3). Cleaved caspase-3 staining was done according to the same protocol, using a monoclonal antibody that was raised to the large fragment of active caspase-3 (catalog item 9664; Cell Signaling Technology).  Statistical analysis.. For most experiments, a Holm-Sidak one-way analysis of variance test was used to determine statistical significance (P < 0.05). For fluorogenic caspase-3 assays, replicate experiments were assayed with uniform instrument settings. Analysis of variance was used to determine statistical significance for those experiments where control measurements had a standard deviation that was <20% of the mean. For experiments performed at different times, instrument sensitivity was a major source of variability (standard deviation [SD] greater than 30% of the mean). For these experiments, a paired t test was used to determine statistical significance of experimental groups compared to control cells (P < 0.05). For analysis of tumor size as a function of time in the in vivo experiments, a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test for statistical significance with the Bonferroni procedure for all pairwise multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat software (Systat Software, Inc.). RESULTS.  The death receptor pathway is important for M51R VSV-induced apoptosis in GBM cells.. Previous experiments using mouse L929 cells indicated that the death receptor pathway was the predominant pathway by which infection with M51R VSV induced apoptosis (16). The purpose of the experiments shown in Fig. 1 was to determine if the death receptor pathway is also important for the induction of apoptosis by M51R VSV in human GBM cells. The U87 cell line was chosen for these experiments since it has been widely used in studies of susceptibility of GBM cells to oncolysis by VSV and other viruses (19, 29, 30, 34, 40, 52, 53). U87 GBM cells were stably transfected with either an empty vector (EV) or a vector expressing a dominant negative form of the Fas death receptor (dnFas). Clonal cell lines were established by antibiotic selection, and clones expressing functional dnFas were identified by their resistance to induction of apoptosis by Fas-activating antibody (ch. 11). Transfected or nontransfected cells were infected with M51R VSV for various periods of time, cell extracts were prepared, and caspase-3-like activity was assessed. M51R VSV induced high levels of caspase-3-like activity in nontransfected and empty vector control cells but induced significantly lower levels in the dnFas cells (Fig. 1A). The extent of inhibition by dnFas expression was similar to that observed in control experiments in which U87 EV- and dnFas-expressing cells were treated with an agonistic antibody (ch.11) to the Fas death receptor (Fig. 1B). Thus, expression of dnFas was able to inhibit the apoptotic pathways leading to caspase-3-like activity in U87 cells infected with M51R VSV. Caspase-8 is one of the principal initiator caspases in the death receptor pathway of apoptosis. To determine if the activity of caspase-8 was involved in the induction of apoptosis in M51R VSV-infected U87 cells, cells were left untreated or treated with a caspase-8-specific inhibitor (zIETD), a pan-caspase inhibitor (zVAD), or vehicle alone (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]). Cells were then infected for various times, and cell extracts were assayed for caspase-3-like activity (Fig. 1C). Caspase-3-like activity was undetectable in both zVAD- and zIETD-treated U87 cells, consistent with the requirement for caspase-8 activity for activation of caspase-3 in U87 cells infected with M51R VSV. Collectively, the data in Fig. 1 are consistent with results of similar experiments in L929 cells indicating that the death receptor pathway is a major pathway leading to caspase-3 activation in U87 cells.  The mitochondrial pathway is important for apoptosis induced by death receptor and M51R VSV in U87 GBM cells.. In addition to the death receptor pathway, the other major apoptotic pathway is the mitochondrial pathway. In order to test the involvement of the mitochondrial pathway, U87 cells were stably transfected with a vector that expressed Bcl-X L. Clonal populations were selected by antibiotic resistance, and overexpression of Bcl-X L was tested by immunoblotting. Two clones that had among the highest overexpression of Bcl-X L were selected, and their immunoblots are shown in Fig. 2A. Caspase-3-like activity was dramatically reduced in both U87 Bcl-X L-overexpressing clones infected with M51R VSV (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is also required in addition to the death receptor pathway for M51R VSV-induced activation of caspase-3 in GBM cells. Death receptor signaling has been classified as type I or type II depending on whether signaling is independent of (type I) or depends on (type II) the mitochondrial pathway. The response of U87 cells to infection with M51R VSV resembles a type II response to death receptor ligands. To determine whether the response of U87 cells to Fas receptor ligation is similar to that of type II cells, U87 control and Bcl-X L-overexpressing clones were treated with ch.11 for 12 h, and caspase-3-like activity was assessed (Fig. 2C). Bcl-X L overexpression inhibited caspase activation in response to ch.11, similar to the inhibition in response to M51R VSV infection. These data indicate that U87 cells behave as type II cells in response both to Fas receptor ligation and virus infection. In addition to evaluating caspase activation, the induction of cell death in M51R VSV-infected U87 cells was determined by assessing plasma membrane integrity by propidium iodide (PI) staining. Control or Bcl-X L-overexpressing cells were mock infected or infected with M51R VSV in the presence or absence of zVAD. At various times postinfection, cells were double labeled with Hoechst and PI (which label the nuclei of all cells and permeable cells, respectively) and analyzed by quantitative fluorescence microscopy. The number of pixels with intensity above the threshold established in mock-infected cells was determined, and the values are expressed as the ratio of the PI-positive area to Hoechst-positive area (Fig. 2D). At early time points postinfection, there was very little PI labeling above the mock-infected controls. However, by 36 h, there was a substantial amount of PI labeling in control cells, which was inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-X L or treatment with zVAD. These data provide further evidence of a role for the mitochondrial pathway in the induction of cell death in U87 cells by infection with M51R VSV.  Bid is required for M51R VSV-induced apoptosis.. Cross talk between pathways during the type II response to death receptor-induced apoptosis is usually mediated by the Bcl-2 family member Bid. Bid is cleaved by caspase-8 to generate the proapoptotic tBid. The cleavage of Bid to tBid was determined through immunoblot analysis by following the disappearance of full-length Bid (Fig. 3A). As a control for normal turnover of Bid, cells were treated with zIETD to inhibit caspase-8 activity or were treated with vehicle (DMSO) alone. Cells were infected for various times with M51R VSV or were treated with ch.11. Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry, and the results of replicate experiments are shown in Fig. 3B. There was a dramatic decrease in the amount of full-length Bid in U87 cells treated with ch.11, which was prevented in the presence of zIETD. The tBid cleavage product produced in cells treated with ch.11 could be detected directly in the same immunoblots upon longer exposure (data not shown). However, in virus-infected cells, the amount of full-length Bid declined over a more prolonged time course, and the tBid cleavage product could not be detected even at prolonged exposures. Thus, if Bid is involved in response to virus infection of U87 cells, it may be due to prolonged generation of small amounts of tBid over the time course of virus infection. In order to determine if Bid was required for activation of caspase-3 by M51R VSV infection, the expression of Bid was silenced using siRNA. U87 cells were transfected with a nontargeting siRNA or with an siRNA targeting Bid for 48 h (Fig. 3C). Cells were then infected with M51R VSV for 20 and 24 h or treated with ch.11 for 12 h, and caspase-3-like activity was assessed (Fig. 3D and E). Silencing Bid expression significantly reduced caspase-3 activation in cells infected with M51R VSV. Cells silenced for Bid expression and treated with ch.11 antibody also had reduced caspase activity compared to cells that were not transfected or transfected with nontargeting siRNA (Fig. 3E). These results provide further evidence that establish U87 cells as type II cells.  Inhibition of apoptosis does not protect U87 cells from cytopathic effects of M51R VSV infection.. Previous analysis of mouse L929 cells indicated that inhibition of apoptosis was sufficient to protect M51R VSV-infected cells from cytopathic effects and cell death (16). However, inhibition of apoptosis in U87 cells by treatment with zVAD or overexpression of Bcl-X L failed to inhibit M51R VSV-induced cytopathic effects. Control or Bcl-X L-overexpressing cells were infected with M51R VSV in the presence or absence of zVAD, and the time course of induction of cytopathic effects was determined by time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy. Figure 4 shows examples of the same fields at 0 and 48 h postinfection. By 48 h, control cells had undergone the morphological changes that are characteristic of apoptosis, including cell rounding, membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, and loss of refractility. Cells treated with zVAD or overexpressing Bcl-X L underwent cell rounding but did not undergo cell shrinkage and retained their refractility. At this time point, rounded cells may not be dead. These data are consistent with the inhibition of some of the morphological changes associated with apoptosis, but treatment with zVAD, overexpression of Bcl-X L, or the combination of the two was not able to inhibit the induction of cytopathic effects by M51R VSV. The effect of inhibiting apoptosis in U87 cells upon cell viability was assessed by an MTT assay, which uses ongoing mitochondrial metabolism as a measure of cell viability. Treatment of U87 cells with zVAD or zIETD had only a small effect on the time course of loss of viability following M51R VSV infection (Fig. 5A). Similarly, overexpression of Bcl-X L had only a small effect on loss of cell viability (Fig. 5B) although the differences from results with control cells were statistically significant at later times postinfection for both caspase inhibitors and Bcl-X L overexpression. The combination of treatment with zVAD and Bcl-X L overexpression substantially delayed the loss of viability (Fig. 5B). However, at much later times postinfection, it was apparent that cell death was not prevented but merely delayed (not shown). Inhibition of apoptosis by Bcl-X L overexpression and treatment with zVAD also did not fully protect cells from the effects of treatment with Fas-activating antibody ch.11 (Fig. 5C). Treatment of nontransfected or vector control U87 cells with ch.11 reduced cell viability to approximately 15% of control by 48 h posttreatment. Treatment of Bcl-X L cells with ch.11 in the presence or absence of zVAD resulted in less loss of viability (40 to 60% of control at 48 h). Similar to results with virus infection, the cells were not fully protected from the induction of cell death.  Overexpression of Bcl-X L does not delay viral oncolysis in vivo.. The data presented thus far show that M51R VSV induces a pathway of caspase activation that can be inhibited by the overexpression of Bcl-X L. This overexpression significantly delays cell death in vitro, but in terms of M51R VSV's potential as an oncolytic agent against GBM tumors, it was important to assess if there is an effect of Bcl-X L overexpression in GBM tumors in vivo. Polyclonal populations of transfected U87 cells were used to establish tumors in vivo because we found that clonal populations of empty vector control U87 cells formed tumors very inefficiently (unpublished results). Polyclonal cells were produced by transfection with a bi-cistronic vector that expresses either firefly luciferase (ZsG LUX) or Bcl-X L (ZsG Bcl-X L) under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and expresses the Zoanthus sp. green fluorescent protein (ZsGreen) under the control of a downstream IRES sequence. ZsGreen-expressing cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Overexpression of Bcl-X L in these cells was similar to that of the clonal cell lines analyzed earlier (Fig. 6A). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the overexpression of Bcl-X L in the starting cell cultures was maintained in the resulting tumors in vivo (Fig. 6A). Transfected cells were injected subcutaneously into the hind flanks of female nude mice. After 1 week, palpable tumors developed (50 to 100 mm 3); the animals were randomized into treatment and control groups, and each animal was injected intravenously twice, 3 days apart, with either M51R VSV (treatment group) or PBS (control group). Tumor size and mouse weight were then determined daily (Fig. 6B). Control ZsG LUX and ZsG Bcl-X L tumors grew to the upper size limit in approximately 1 week after inoculation. Mice that received M51R VSV had markedly reduced tumors, and within 21 days after initial inoculation, mice had no tumor present that was detectable during necropsy. Mice did not have any apparent symptoms of VSV infection and did not experience significant weight loss after inoculation with virus similar to previous results (1). Interestingly, the time course of tumor regression was similar for control and Bcl-X L-overexpressing tumors. This result suggests that Bcl-X L overexpression has little if any effect on oncolytic tumor clearance in U87 GBM tumors. Viral antigen expression and caspase-3 activation in tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific for the VSV envelope glycoprotein (G protein [VSV-G]) and cleaved caspase-3, respectively. Tissue sections were obtained 24 h after the second inoculation from animals bearing ZsG LUX and ZsG Bcl-X L tumors. Tumors taken from animals treated with M51R VSV had focal areas with positive staining for VSV-G (Fig. 7A). There was no obvious difference between tumors derived from ZsG LUX and ZsG Bcl-X L cells in either the extent or intensity of viral antigen staining. Interestingly, the foci of viral antigen staining were associated with different cytopathic effects depending on whether the tumors were derived from U87 ZsG LUX or ZsG Bcl-X L cells. VSV-G staining in control ZsG LUX tumors was coincident with areas containing condensed nuclei and nuclear fragments, indicative of apoptotic cell death. This contrasts with the cytopathic effects observed in the ZsG Bcl-X L tumors, in which few apoptotic bodies could be seen in VSV-G-positive areas. Instead, foci of VSV-G-positive staining were associated with large syncytia (Fig. 7, arrows). Infiltrating inflammatory cells could also be observed in both tumor types but was more obvious in ZsG Bcl-X L tumors (Fig. 7, arrowheads) without the background of apoptotic cells. When stained for cleaved caspase-3, labeling was more prevalent in infected ZsG LUX tumors than in ZsG X L tumors (Fig. 7B). The small but detectable amount of cleaved caspase-3 in the ZsG Bcl-X L tumors was found only in syncytia. This low level of staining is consistent with residual caspase-3 activity observed in infected Bcl-X L-overexpressing U87 cells in vitro. In mock-infected tumors, cleaved caspase-3 could be detected in very few individual cells. These in vivo results are consistent with the conclusion that apoptosis induced by M51R VSV is inhibited when Bcl-X L is overexpressed in GBM cells. DISCUSSION. Much of the attractiveness of VSV as an oncolytic agent is the potency with which it induces apoptosis in infected cells. However, the pathways leading to the biochemical features of apoptosis, such as caspase activation, appear to vary among different cell types. Previous experiments in other cell types have implicated either the death receptor or mitochondrial pathways as the major mechanisms of cell death in response to M protein mutant VSV (16, 17, 23, 41, 46). The data presented here indicate that M51R VSV induces apoptosis via both the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways in U87 GBM cells. The evidence for involvement of the death receptor pathway includes experiments showing that dnFas and chemical caspase-8 inhibition delay activation of apoptosis in response to M51R VSV infection in U87 cells (Fig. 1). However, Bcl-X L overexpression in U87 cells inhibited caspase-3 activation in the presence of M51R VSV infection as well (Fig. 2). This contrasts with previous results from our laboratory, which determined the pathways activated by M51R VSV in mouse L929 cells (16, 17). In L929 cells, the mitochondrial pathway was activated by M51R VSV infection; however, inhibiting the mitochondrial pathway had no effect on the induction of apoptosis. The difference in the relative importance of the mitochondrial pathway in L929 versus U87 cells can be readily explained by analogy to the type I versus type II response to death receptor ligands. Collectively, our results indicate that L929 cells respond to M51R VSV infection in the manner of type I cells and that U87 cells respond in the manner of type II cells. The type II cell death response is thought to occur in cells where death-induced signaling complex (DISC) signaling is impaired, either due to poor formation of the DISC itself (38, 39) or because of upregulated inhibitors of the downstream caspase cascade (20, 49). These type II cells thus require an amplification of the death stimulus through the mitochondrial pathway (20, 38, 39, 49). The communication between these two pathways is known to occur through Bid (54, 55). Consistent with this mechanism, silencing Bid expression with siRNA in U87 cells inhibited induction of apoptosis in the presence of M51R VSV (Fig. 3). Inhibitors of apoptosis (treatment with zVAD and overexpression of Bcl-X L) do not completely block induction of cytopathic effects in M51R VSV-infected U87 cells (Fig. 4). There are two possible explanations for this result: either there is incomplete inhibition of apoptosis with these inhibitors, or alternative pathways are being activated during infection. It has been shown that VSV induces autophagy in infected cells (27, 28), and we have observed autophagy induction by LC3 I to II cleavage during infection in U87 cells via immunoblotting (data not shown). However, autophagy as a cell death mechanism remains unclear (26). We have also performed experiments to inhibit programmed necrosis, or necroptosis, an alternative form of cell death known to be activated during inhibition of death receptor-induced apoptosis (18). Treatment of U87 cells with necrostatin-1 (an inhibitor of necroptosis) and zVAD did not protect cells from cytopathic effects and cell death (data not shown). There are other potential mechanisms of cell death that may be initiated by the presence of a VSV infection and are potentially important; however, the evidence presented here indicates that even in the presence of apoptotic inhibitors, U87 cells infected with M51R VSV eventually die. This result also contrasts with results obtained in L929 cells infected with M51R VSV, in which inhibition of induction of apoptosis allows the cells to survive the infection and eventually to clear the virus infection (Daniel F. Gaddy and Douglas S. Lyles, unpublished results). This raises the possibility that inhibition of apoptosis in type I cells allows the cells to survive while inhibition in type II cells does not, perhaps due to extensive damage to mitochondria through the type II mechanism. Many cancers, including GBM tumors, have deregulated mitochondrial apoptosis pathways, often overexpressing antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-X L (25, 44). This has been a challenge when GBM tumors are treated with chemotherapy since overexpression of Bcl-X L or other inhibitors of apoptosis usually leads to inhibition of tumor regression in response to treatment. However, we observed efficient tumor regression following treatment with M51R VSV of nude mice bearing U87 tumors that overexpress Bcl-X L (Fig. 6A). This unexpected result of tumor clearance is likely due to the fact that overexpression of Bcl-X L delays, but does not prevent, cell death in response to virus infection. The time course of tumor regression, which occurs over 2 to 3 weeks (Fig. 6B), may be too long for the rate at which individual cells die to be a significant factor in this system. This result bodes well for the potential of M51R VSV as an oncolytic agent in that, even in the presence of Bcl-X L overexpression, oncolytic VSV can reduce tumor burden. However, in a model of CLL, treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2 accelerated the induction of cell death and accelerated tumor clearance in response to oncolytic VSV (46). Thus, in some tumor systems, the rate at which individual cells die in response to virus infection can be a factor in the rate of tumor regression. Interestingly, tumors derived from U87 cells that overexpress Bcl-X L do not appear to have the same pathological changes as control cells when infected in vivo. Instead, Bcl-X L-overexpressing cells form large syncytia in vivo (Fig. 7). VSV-infected cells do not normally form syncytia in most cell types; however, mutant viruses have been developed in order to harness this property from other viruses for increased VSV oncolytic potency (12). Ebert et al. found that a fusogenic VSV mutant extended survival of mice harboring hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts compared to mice treated with the nonfusogenic VSV. They also cite experiments which indicate that these infected syncytia are more inflammatory and will result in a stronger immune response that is likely to aid in tumor clearance (32). Further, it may be possible to modulate how infected cells die in order to increase the immune response directed against tumor tissue. For example, when mitochondrial protein HMGB1 is released by a necrotic cell as opposed to an apoptotic cell, it undergoes an oxidation that modifies HMGB1 from a tolerogenic protein to an immunostimulatory protein (8, 21, 37). Thus, complete tumor clearance by direct viral oncolysis may not be necessary if, instead, an approach that induces a cell death mechanism alerts the immune system to the presence of a tumor. With the cell death pathway described here, such an approach may improve the outcomes of oncolytic virus therapy for GBM. Two different oncolytic VSVs have recently been considered by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (47, 48). This is an important step in terms of the clinical development of oncolytic VSV. Observations presented here will likely advance future development of clinically approved therapy by showing that common mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy, such as Bcl-X L overexpression, do not necessarily lead to resistance to therapy with oncolytic viruses. They also provide a mechanistic basis for approaches such as use of small-molecule inhibitors of Bcl-2 family members that either increase the rate of tumor clearance (46) or redirect cell death in an attempt to increase antitumor immunity (32). These strategies should be explored further as oncolytic VSV enters clinical development. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. This work was supported by NIH grants R01 AI052304, R01 AI032983, and T32 AI007401.

                "text": "Selective depletion of mutant p53 by cancer chemopreventive isothiocyanates and its structure-activity relationships\tIsothiocyanates (ITCs) derived from cruciferous vegetables induce apoptosis in cancer cells. We demonstrate that certain naturally-occurring ITCs selectively deplete mutant p53, but not the wild type, and do so via a transcription-independent mechanism. Direct p53 binding followed by conformational changes appears to be a mechanism by which mutant p53 is depleted. Structure-activity relationship studies (SARs) using naturally-occurring and synthetic ITCs show that depletion is influenced by the ITC side chain moiety. Furthermore, we show that cells with p53 mutations are more sensitive to cytotoxicity induced by phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) than those with the wild type. 2,2-diphenylethyl ITC, a synthetic ITC and one of the most potent depletors of mutant p53 studied, induces apoptosis to the greatest extent in mutant p53 breast cancer cells. Collectively, this study shows that mutant p53 depletion may be an important novel target for cancer chemoprevention and therapy by natural and synthetic ITCs. Introduction. Isothiocyanates (ITCs) have been shown to induce apoptosis in cultured tumor cells and in tissues of treated animals. Induction of apoptosis is believed to be an important mechanism for the chemopreventive activities of ITCs (1); however, the early events in the induction of apoptosis by ITCs have not yet been fully investigated. Our studies have shown that, once inside the cell, ITCs bind to proteins, and that protein binding affinities are closely associated with the ability to induce apoptosis (2). Recently, we identified tubulin as one of the binding targets for ITCs and found that covalent binding to the cysteine residues in tubulin causes conformation changes, leading to its degradation (3). The tumor suppressor p53 plays a pivotal role in many cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (4). About half of all human cancers carry p53 mutations (4). Most p53 mutations are within the central core DNA-binding domain (DBD); this disrupts DNA binding to p53, and severely abrogates the tumor suppressor function. Mutant p53 impairs the DNA-damage response, and renders tumor cells more resistant to drug-induced apoptosis (5). Evidence also shows that mutant p53 promotes tumorigenesis through gain of function by transactivating growth-related genes or by suppressing specific target genes (6). Mutant p53 overexpression in deficient cells causes enhanced plating efficiency in soft agar and increased tumorigenicity in nude mice (6). Also, mice harboring a p53 point mutation have a high frequency of tumor formation and metastasis compared to p53-deficient mice (7, 8). Humans with germ-line p53 mutation (Li-Fraumeni Syndrome) are at significantly increased risk of cancer development (9). Therefore, abolishing mutant p53 may offer a promising approach for cancer prevention and therapy. A previous study using p53 ?/? mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that apoptosis induced by phenethyl ITC (PEITC) is p53-dependent (10). However, other studies have shown that PEITC induces apoptosis in prostate and colon cancer cells with different p53 statuses (11, 12). In this study, we report an intriguing observation that PEITC, which is abundant in watercress, can selectively deplete mutant p53 protein, but not the wild type. This is a potentially important finding because of the role of mutant p53 protein in human cancers. We found that PEITC-induced mutant p53 depletion occurs post-transcriptionally. To discover which ITCs most efficiently deplete mutant p53, we conducted structure-activity relationship studies (SARs) of both synthetic and naturally-occurring ITCs by focusing on the following structural characteristics of the ITC side chain moiety: 1) lipophilicity, 2) electronic factor, 3) steric factor, and 4) alkyl chain length. We also studied aliphatic ITCs, including sulforaphane (SFN) and allyl ITC (AITC), which are abundant in broccoli and mustard, respectively. To explore the possible mechanisms by which ITCs deplete mutant p53, we studied covalent modification of cysteine residues in purified mutant p53 DNA binding domain (DBD) protein by ITCs and its sequential conformational changes. Induction of apoptosis by ITCs was then compared in cells with either mutant or wild type p53, and the SARs for apoptosis induction in a mutant p53 breast cancer cell line were also examined. Results. PEITC causes rapid depletion of mutant p53 by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Treatment of human H596 (G245C) non-small cell lung cancer cells with 15 \u00a5\u00ecM PEITC caused a rapid depletion of mutant p53 protein. Depletion occurred as early as 2 h and peaked at 4 h; it was sustained during 24 h treatment and was concentration-dependent (Fig. 1A). The expression of other proteins, including Bax, DR5, Hsp90, and JNK, was not altered (not shown). To determine whether depletion occurs at the post-transcriptional or transcriptional level, reverse transcription-PCR was performed on RNA derived from DMSO and PEITC-treated H596 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, 2, 4 and 6 h after PEITC treatment, the mutant p53 mRNA levels remained unchanged. Therefore, PEITC depleted mutant p53 without causing changes in the p53 mRNA expression levels. These results strongly suggest that PEITC depletes mutant p53 at the post-transcriptional level. We next examined the effects of other widely studied naturally-occurring ITCs, benzyl ITC (BITC), SFN and AITC, on mutant p53 protein levels. H596 cells were incubated with PEITC, BITC, SFN or AITC for 2 h. Fig. 1C shows that BITC at 10 \u00a5\u00ecM significantly reduced the level of mutant p53, while at 20 \u00a5\u00ecM it showed a similar potency as PEITC. However, neither SFN nor AITC significantly affected mutant p53 protein levels, even at 40 \u00a5\u00ecM; although at 60 \u00a5\u00ecM SFN slightly reduced mutant p53 levels. To further investigate the structural requirement of ITCs to deplete mutant p53, N-methylphenethylamine (NMPEA), an analog of PEITC lacking an ITC functional group was used. Fig. 1D shows that NMPEA at 15 \u00a5\u00ecM failed to alter the mutant p53 protein level even up to 24 h or at 60 \u00a5\u00ecM for 2 h. Because the ITC functional group is highly electrophilic, these results indicate that the ITC group is essential for the effect, possibly through binding to target proteins. Moreover, the structure of the side-chain moiety appears to dictate the potency of mutant p53 depletion by ITCs. PEITC depletes mutant p53 in a variety of cancer cells. We next examined whether the depletion of mutant p53 by PEITC is cell type-specific. Various tumor cells with mutant p53 were used, including MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer, R280K), MDA-MB-468 (breast cancer, R273H), DU145 (prostate cancer, P274L/V223F), SW480 (colon cancer, R273H) and SCC-4 (oral cancer, P151S). Notably, while the types of mutations among the cell lines vary, all are located in the core DNA-binding domain. The five cell lines were treated with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM or 15 \u00a5\u00ecM PEITC, depending on the observed cytotoxicity. Fig. 2A shows that PEITC depleted mutant p53 in all five cell lines in a time-dependent manner, and certain cells appeared more responsive than others. These results clearly show that the effects of PEITC on mutant p53 are not specific to a certain p53 mutation. Wild type p53 is not a target for depletion by PEITC in cancer cells. To determine whether wild type p53 is affected by PEITC treatment, we used A549 lung cancer cells, HCT116 colon cancer cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells and MCF-10A human normal mammary epithelial cells, all expressing wild type p53. Cell lines were treated with 15 or 20 \u00a5\u00ecM PEITC for 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. Contrary to mutant p53, wild type p53 expression did not decrease over the treatment period. In fact, it appeared marginally elevated at 24 h in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting that PEITC may moderately activate p53 in cells with wild type p53. To investigate whether the conformation of p53 contributes to the differential response to PEITC, we used H1299 lung cancer cells (null p53) stably transfected with temperature-sensitive p53 mutant 143Ala (H1299-143A) (13). p53 mutant 143Ala can have two conformations: at 32.5\u00a1\u00c6C it possesses a strong DNA-binding ability and generates transcriptional activity, thus, functioning like wild type p53, and at 37\u00a1\u00c6C its ability to bind DNA and activate transcription is severely diminished or lost, acting as mutant p53. After treatment of H1299-143A cells with PEITC for 24 h, p53 mutant 143A protein was depleted more robustly at 37\u00a1\u00c6C than at 32.5\u00a1\u00c6C (Fig. 2C). To rule out the possibility that lower temperature caused the effect, H1299 cells stably expressing non-temperature-sensitive p53 mutant R175H (H1299-175H) were treated with PEITC for 24 h; the same extent of depletion was observed at both temperature (Fig. 2C). Therefore, our data suggest that the differential response between mutant and wild type p53 to PEITC is likely due to the difference in their conformation. SARs for the depletion of mutant p53 by ITCs. BITC and PEITC are arylalkyl ITCs of different alkyl chain length with relatively high lipophilicities, whereas SFN, an alkyl ITC, is considerably more water-soluble. Previously, we showed BITC, PEITC and SFN exhibit differential activity toward total protein binding and apoptosis induction, following an order of BITC>PEITC>SFN (2). Moreover, BITC and PEITC can modify proteins and tubulin to a greater extent than SFN, and the degree of binding correlates with the potency of the ITC to induce mitosis arrest and apoptosis (2, 3). Importantly, the same order of potency was seen toward mutant p53 depletion. NMPEA, an analog of PEITC without the ITC functional group, is completely devoid of all of these activities. Here, we studied the structural features of the ITC side chain moiety with relation to the extent of depletion of mutant p53. Compounds of more than one aromatic ring with greater lipophilicity than BITC and PEITC were used. These compounds are 2,2-diphenylethyl ITC and 4-phenoxybenzyl ITC. We also examined the effects of an electron-withdrawing and an electron-releasing substituent at the para position of the aromatic ring by using 4-chlorobenzyl ITC and 4-methoxybenzyl ITC. To investigate whether covalent binding by ITCs is a trigger of mutant p53 depletion, we selected ITCs with bulky substituent(s) adjacent to the ?N=C=S to create steric hindrance, including D-\u00a5\u00e1-methylbenzyl ITC and trityl ITC. Aromatic ITCs with varying alkyl chain length from phenyl ITC to 6-phenylhexyl ITC (6-PHITC) were used. Structures of the ITCs are shown in Fig. 3A. The aliphatic compounds used include cyclohexylmethyl ITC, SFN, erucin and AITC. As shown in Figure 3 (B?E), mutant p53 is depleted similarly in H596 (Fig. 3B and C) and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3D and E) cancer cells treated with 10 or 20 \u00a5\u00ecM ITCs, respectively, for 24 h. Also, at equimolar concentrations BITC and PEITC deplete mutant p53 to approximately the same extent, while SFN depletes p53 significantly less in H596 or MD-MBA-231 cells, compared to DMSO control. The presence of a phenyl ring appears important as its electron-withdrawing ability reduces the electron density around the carbon atom of the ?N=C=S functional group rendering it more electrophilic (14). The aliphatic ITCs, cyclohexylmethyl ITC, SFN, erucin and AITC, all have little to no mutant p53 depleting activity, whereas 2,2-diphenylethyl ITC and 4-phenoxybenzyl ITC deplete mutant p53 to an even greater extent than BITC (Fig. 3B and D). Thus, increasing the lipophilicity of the side chain moiety by the addition of aromatic groups increases the activity of the ITC to deplete mutant p53. Introducing an electron-withdrawing or releasing substituent at the para position dose not exert much effect, as no significant difference was seen with 4-chlorobenzyl ITC and 4-methoxybenzyl ITC when compared with BITC. In MDA-MB-231 cells, 4-chlorobenzyl ITC may deplete to a greater extent than BITC; however, 4-methoxybenzyl ITC is just as efficient as BITC, if not more. D-\u00a5\u00e1-methylbenzyl ITC and trityl ITC deplete little to no mutant p53; these ITCs have bulky substituents at the \u00a5\u00e1-carbon adjacent to the ITC functional group. These differ from 2,2-diphenylethyl ITC, which does not have its bulky substituents on the \u00a5\u00e1-carbon. Bulky substituents adjacent to the ?N=C=S group could hinder binding of the ITC to proteins. The alkyl chain length also seems to influence the activity (Fig. 3C and E). PITC does not deplete mutant p53, whereas BITC, PEITC, 3-PPITC, 4-PBITC, 5-PPeITC and 6-PHITC all deplete mutant p53 to different degrees. Interestingly, depletion is greatest when one, two or four methylene groups are inserted between the phenyl ring and the ?N=C=S functional group (BITC, PEITC and 4-PBITC, respectively), and it is lowest when three methylene groups are present (3-PPITC). The large contrast of PPITC compared with PEITC and PBITC is notable. Covalent modification of mutant (G245C) p53 DBD by ITCs and subsequent conformational changes. As in the case of tubulin degradation, it is possible that mutant p53 protein is depleted by ITCs as a result of direct binding to its cysteine residues and subsequent conformational changes. We used a monochlorobimane fluorometric assay (15) to study cysteine modification of mutant (G245C) p53 DBD by ITCs, and compared intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensities as an indicator of conformational changes (16). The G245C point mutation is especially relevant because it is the p53 mutation present in the H596 non-small cell lung cancer cell line studied here. Fig. 4A shows the relative amount of free thiols present, as indicated by relative fluorescence intensities, in the mutant (G245C) p53 DBD after 1 h incubation with DMSO (negative control), ITCs or iodoacetamide (positive control). BITC, 2,2-diphenylethyl ITC, 4-methoxybenzyl ITC, 4-chlorobenzyl ITC, PEITC, and 3-PPITC show greater binding affinities for mutant (G245C) p53 DBD than do trityl ITC, cyclohexylmethyl ITC, SFN, AITC and PITC (p<0.05). These affinities correlate well with their respective activity to deplete mutant p53. However, the binding affinities are not always in agreement with the depleting potencies of ITCs. For example, 4-phenoxybenzyl ITC was one of the most effective depletors, but it did not display stronger binding to mutant p53 than the weaker depletors, such as D-\u00a5\u00e1-methylbenzyl ITC. These results suggest that binding affinity to mutant p53 can only partially explain depleting activities and other factor(s) may be involved. Using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the conformation of mutant p53 changes to different degrees after its reaction with BITC, 4-phenoxybenzyl ITC, D-\u00a5\u00e1-methylbenzyl ITC and SFN (Fig. 4B). These ITCs were chosen because their binding affinities correlate either well or poorly with depletion. 4-Phenoxybenzyl ITC, a potent depletor, induces the greatest conformational change, despite its lower binding affinity for mutant p53 protein. BITC causes the second largest conformational change, followed by D-\u00a5\u00e1-methylbenzyl ITC and finally SFN. D-\u00a5\u00e1-methylbenzyl ITC shows a lower binding affinity than BITC (p<0.05), but a higher binding affinity than 4-phenoxybenzyl ITC (p<0.05); however, D-\u00a5\u00e1-methylbenzyl ITC does not deplete mutant p53 to the same degree as 4-phenoxybenzyl ITC. The fact that D-\u00a5\u00e1-methylbenzyl ITC induces less mutant p53 protein conformational change than 4-phenoxybenzyl ITC may explain why it does not deplete as efficiently. Similarly, despite its binding to mutant p53, SFN causes the least conformational change among ITCs tested, which correlates with its lack of depleting activity. Mutant p53 cells are more sensitive to apoptosis induced by PEITC than wild type cells. The role of p53 in the induction of apoptosis by ITCs is not well established and likely to be cell-specific. Mutant p53 renders cancer cells resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs; if ITCs can deplete mutant p53, then ITCs should be more cytotoxic in cells with mutant p53 protein. To examine this possibility, we assessed the cytotoxicity induced by PEITC in cancer cells containing either wild type or mutant p53. Three sets of cell lines from lung, breast, and colon were used: A549 (wild type p53) and H596 (mutant p53) lung cancer cells, MCF-7 (wild type p53) and MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 (mutant p53) breast cancer cells, HCT116 (wild type p53) and SW480 (mutant p53) colon cancer cells. After treating with PEITC for 24 h, apoptosis was determined by a caspase-3 activity assay. As shown in Fig. 5A, all the mutant p53 cancer cells appeared significantly more sensitive than the wild type cells to PEITC-induced apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis by various ITCs in a mutant p53 cell line. To examine the correlation between depletion of mutant p53 and apoptosis by ITCs, FITC-annexin V staining assay was used to quantify apoptotic cells, we treated MDA-MB-231 cancer cells with DMSO or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM of various ITCs for 24 h, Fig. 5B shows that treatment with BITC, 2,2-diphenylethyl ITC, 3-PPITC or 4-PBITC, which all deplete mutant p53 (Figure 3B?E), results in a greater induction of apoptosis than treatment with DMSO (p<0.05). 2,2-diphenylethyl ITC, the most potent depletors of mutant p53 studied, is the strongest inducer of apoptosis (p<0.05 compared to BITC). The percentage of apoptotic cells induced by trityl ITC, cyclohexylmethyl ITC or SFN, all of which deplete little to no mutant p53, does not differ from control. However, the correlation is not consistently evident. For example, 3-PPITC, which does not deplete mutant p53 to the same extent as BITC or 4-PBITC, induces the same level of apoptosis as these ITCs. Discussion and Conclusions. In this study we demonstrate that, depending on the structure, ITCs can robustly deplete mutant p53 protein in a variety of cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The depletion appears to be specific to mutant p53, because wild type p53 is not affected by the same treatments. This is the first report of mutant p53 as a potential novel target for ITCs. Depletion of mutant p53 may be an important event in cancer prevention as ITCs may suppress gain-of-function properties through mutant p53 depletion. Furthermore, depletion of mutant p53 may reduce drug-resistance, and lead to new strategies for treating cancer in the clinic. Our data show that PEITC causes mutant p53 depletion at the post-transcriptional level, since mutant p53 mRNA remains unchanged by PEITC treatment. Together with the fact that MNPEA, an analog without ITC functional group, is devoid of depleting activity, these results suggest a possible mechanism involving protein modification via covalent binding by the ITC functional group. Previously, we showed that the potency of inhibition of tumorigenesis by aromatic ITCs is related to the lipophilicity and alkyl chain length of the side chain moiety (14, 17). The present study also showed that depletion is influenced by the structure of the side chain moiety of ITC compounds. The lipophilicity and the steric hindrance appear to be the most important factors in determining the activity of ITCs toward mutant p53 depletion. We demonstrated that increasing lipophilicity (by adding aromatic rings) and creating spatial hindrance (by introducing bulky substituents) at the \u00a5\u00e1-carbon significantly enhances or decreases the p53 depleting activity, respectively. These results again support a model for mutant p53 depletion in which ITCs bind to the protein via -N=C=S through hydrophobic interactions. The role of the aromatic ring is further suggested by the observations that aliphatic ITCs have little or no depleting activity. The alkyl chain length in arylalkyl ITCs also affects their activity. The sharp decline in depleting activity of PITC compared to BITC and PPITC compared to PEITC and PBITC suggest that the subtle changes of alkyl chain length in arylalkyl ITCs can markedly influence activity, possibly due to specific spatial requirements for interactions with the protein targets. Studies have shown that inhibition of endogenous mutant p53 with RNA interference(RNAi) sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agent-induced cell death in vitro and in vivo (18). We found in human lung, breast and colon cancer cells that mutant p53 confers cells with increased sensitivity to PEITC-induced cytotoxicity. Xiaoet al also showed that MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with mutant p53 were more sensitive to BITC-induced apoptosis than the wild type MCF-7 cells and the normal human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells (19). The discovery of 2,2-diphenylethyl ITC, a synthetic compound, as one of the most potent depletors of mutant p53, which induces apoptosis to a greater extent than BITC, is potentially important. We are currently evaluating the efficacy of this compound as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent in rodents with mutant p53. We previously showed that BITC and PEITC have greater binding affinities than SFN toward intracellular proteins and that protein binding affinities of ITCs correlate well with their potencies of apoptosis induction (2). We also reported that ITCs covalently bind in vitro and in vivo to the cysteine residues in tubulin, causing its conformation change followed by aggregate formation and degradation (3). The levels of modification of tubulin by BITC, PEITC and SFN correlate with their potencies of apoptosis induction. Pretreatment of cells with tubulin binding agents, for example, taxol, diminishes the binding by ITCs and consequently the downstream effects. The exact protein targets of ITCs for mutant p53 depletion are not yet identified; it is possible certain p53 chaperone or other proteins, such as Hsp90, could serve as targets. It is well-known that cysteines in p53 are potential sites of covalent modification (20), and that the modification could lead to a change in p53 function. In this study, we explored the relationships of mutant p53 depletion and direct covalent modification of cysteine residues by ITCs in the mutant p53 DNA-binding domain and the subsequent conformational changes. We found the binding affinities to mutant p53 DBD of some, but not all, ITCs appear to correlate with their ability to deplete. Certain ITCs, such as 4-phenoxybenzyl ITC, exhibit potent depleting, yet low binding activity to mutant p53. However, this disparity may be partially explained by protein conformational changes as a result of the binding event. Our studies show that binding to mutant p53 may constitute an important step for its depletion by ITCs. Wild type p53 is tightly regulated through MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and 26S proteasome degradation process. We had preliminary data showing that PEITC-induced depletion of mutant p53 cannot be abrogated by MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 or 26S proteasome inhibitor MG132 and bortezomib in H596 cells (see supplement data), suggesting that PEITC induces the depletion likely through a novel mechanism not by a MDM2-ubiquitin-mediated 26S proteasome-independent pathway. Additional in vivo studies seem to be warranted to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of mutant p53 depletion by ITCs and its functional consequences. Experimental Section.

Expression and purification of wild type and mutant p53 DNA-binding domain. BL21 (DE2) Escherichia coli were transformed with pET29b wild type or mutant (G245C) p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD) plasmids. The E. coli were then cultured in LB media supplemented with 100 \u00a5\u00ecM ZnCl 2 and 25 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL kanamycin at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C until OD 600 = 0.6?0.8. Protein expression was induced by 0.1 mM isopropyl \u00a5\u00e2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 hrs at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for wild type and 16\u00a1\u00c6C for mutant p53. Bacterial pellets were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000\u00a1\u00bfg, 10 min, 4\u00a1\u00c6C and lysed via sonication in 50 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7 buffer. The soluble fraction was passed through a Capto S cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 50 mM Tris, 200 mM KCl, 5mM DTT, pH 7. Eluted protein was dialyzed overnight against a non-salt dialysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 5mM DTT, pH 7) and loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare). p53 DBD was purified via a AKTApurifier-10\u00a2\u00e2 protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare) with an increasing KCl salt gradient and purity was tested by SDS-PAGE and coomassie blue staining. Purified protein was dialyzed in PBS and protein concentrations were determined prior to performing fluorescence experiments.  Monochlorobimane fluorometric assay. Using a white 96-well plate, 100 \u00a5\u00ecL of purified mutant (G245C) p53 DNA-binding domain protein in PBS was treated with DMSO, 100 \u00a5\u00ecM ITCs in DMSO or 500 \u00a5\u00ecM iodoacetamide (positive binding control). An additional well containing 100 \u00a5\u00ecL PBS was used to determine background. Samples were incubated with compounds in the dark for 1 h at 32\u00a1\u00c6C, after which 5 \u00a5\u00ecL of 10 mM monochlorobimane was added (in dark) and samples were further incubated in the dark at 32\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 min. Fluorescence readings were then obtained using a BIO-TEK Synergy HT plate reader (\u00a5\u00eb ex 380 nm; \u00a5\u00eb em 485 nm). Data shown are the average of three experiments with standard deviation. A two-sample t-test was performed, assuming unequal variances, in Microsoft Excel and * indicates p<0.05.  Fluorescence emission spectroscopy. A SPEX FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer was used to collect emission spectra. \u00a5\u00eb ex 280 nm; \u00a5\u00eb em 285?400 nm; integration time 0.5 sec nm ?1; 3 scans averaged; slit width 5 nm. Data was collected after 6 \u00a5\u00ecM of mutant (G245C) p53 DBD (250 \u00a5\u00ecL) was incubated for 1h at 32\u00a1\u00c6C alone or with DMSO or 60 \u00a5\u00ecM ITCs.  Caspase-3 activity assay. Caspase-3 activity was measured by detection of the cleavage of a colorimetric caspase-3 substrate, N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD)-p-nitroaniline, using an assay kit (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The assay was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In brief, cells were treated with drugs for 24 h. The cells were collected, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer provided by the manufacturer. The same amount of protein extracts (100?200 \u00a5\u00ecg) were incubated in a reaction buffer containing N-acetyl-DEVD-p-nitroaniline at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C for 2 to 4 h. The levels of the resulting proteolytic fragment p-nitroanilide were measured as optical density at 405 nm with a plate reader. The data represent the mean \u00a1\u00be SD of three independent experiments.  Annexin V apoptosis assay. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated at 40?50% confluency with DMSO, 10 \u00a5\u00ecM BITC, 2,2-diphenylethyl ITC, 4-methoxybenzyl ITC, trityl ITC, cyclohexylmethyl ITC, SFN, 3-PPITC or 4-PBITC in DMSO for 24 h, after which time cells were collected, washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 1X binding buffer from FITC Annexin V apoptosis kit (BD Pharmingen). Then, 100 \u00a5\u00ecL of each sample was added to a 5 mm tube and the Annexin V apoptosis kit protocol was followed. Samples were immediately analyzed with flow cytometry. Data shown are the average of three experiments with standard deviation. A two-sample t-test was performed, assuming unequal variances, in Microsoft Excel and * indicates p<0.05.

A major goal is therefore to replace vincristine with novel potent chemotherapeutic agents?in particular, with microtubule stabilizing and destabilizing compounds?with a larger therapeutic window. Here, we investigated the antiproliferative, cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effect of patupilone (epothilone B [EPO906]), a novel, non?taxane-related and nonneurotoxic microtubule-stabilizing agent in human medulloblastoma cell lines. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of patupilone alone and in combination with ionizing radiation was determined in the 3 representative human medulloblastoma cell lines D341Med, D425Med, and DAOY. Patupilone alone effectively reduced the proliferative activity and clonogenicity of all medulloblastoma cell lines tested at picomolar concentrations (50?200 pM) and resulted in an at least additive anticlonogenic effect in combination with clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation (2 or 5 Gy). Cell-cycle analysis revealed a sequential G2-M arrest and sub-G1 accumulation in a dose- and treatment-dependent manner after exposure to patupilone. In tumor xenografts derived from D425Med cells, a minimal treatment regimen with patupilone and fractionated irradiation (1 \u00a1\u00bf 2 mg/kg plus 3 \u00a1\u00bf 3 Gy) resulted in an extended tumor growth delay for the 2 single treatment modalities alone and a supra-additive treatment response for the combined treatment modality, with complete tumor regressions. These results demonstrate the potent efficacy of patupilone against medulloblastoma cell lines and indicate that patupilone represents a promising candidate to replace vincristine as part of a combined treatment strategy with ionizing radiation. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. 1 Standard therapy for medulloblastoma comprises neurosurgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, nearly one-half of all patients die of progressive disease, and survivors experience considerable adverse effects, 2? 4 including radiation-dependent reduction of neurocognitive performance. 5? 8 Medulloblastoma is a relatively radiation sensitive tumor entity. Concurrent radiochemotherapy for medulloblastoma often includes the microtubule-disrupting agent vincristine. However, use of vincristine alone or as part of a combined treatment regimen is highly toxic; 3, 9 therefore, treatment modifications have been reported frequently. 10? 12 Of note, excellent outcomes were reported in a multi-institution phase II trial in which patients with average- and high-risk medulloblastoma were treated with risk-adapted craniospinal radiotherapy without concurrent vincristine therapy. In this trial, vincristine was only part of the dose-intensive postirradiation treatment (cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and vincristine), challenging the value of concomitant vincristine treatment during radiotherapy. 13 Therefore, a major goal is to replace vincristine, as part of multimodality treatment regimens, with novel potent chemotherapeutic agents, such as carboplatin, which is under clinical investigation, either a) together with vincristine during craniospinal radiotherapy?as in the COG 99701 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00003203) for patients with metastatic medulloblastoma 14? b) with the aim of substituting vincristine during craniospinal radiotherapy?as in the future SIOP-Europe PNET 6 medulloblastoma study for \u00a1\u00b0standard-risk\u00a1\u00b1 patients with medulloblastoma?or c) with other promising microtubule-stabilizing and -destabilizing agents, which have been investigated thoroughly in the preclinical setting and which show promising activity against a panel of xenograft-derived embryonal tumors. 15 Patupilone (epothilone B [EPO906]), which is currently being tested in phase III clinical trials, 16 is a novel microtubule-targeting cytotoxic agent?that is structurally unrelated to paclitaxel and docetaxel. Patupilone is 3?20 times more potent than the taxanes in vitro and has shown a safe toxicity profile in adults. 17 Patupilone stabilizes preformed microtubules and leads to aberrant spindle formation during mitosis. Patupilone has been shown to induce regression of various types of human tumors in vivo, including glioma, lung, colon, breast, prostate, and ovarian carcinomas. Of note and in contrast to paclitaxel, patupilone is equally cytotoxic to paclitaxel-susceptible and paclitaxel-resistant cells that display a multidrug-resistance phenotype due to overexpression of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump. 17 The combined treatment with patupilone and ionizing irradiation showed a supra-additive effect in vitro and in vivo in lung and colon carcinoma models. 18, 19 Combination of ionizing radiation and patupilone has also been tested in a phase I trial involving brain tumors. 20 We investigated the efficacy of patupilone alone and in combination with ionizing radiation in different human medulloblastoma cell lines. We showed that patupilone alone is extremely potent at picomolar concentrations in medulloblastoma cell lines, and combined treatment with clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation results in an at least additive anticlonogenic effect in vitro and induces a strong supra-additive treatment response in vivo. Materials and Methods. Cell Cultures, Reagents, and Irradiation. Patupilone was kindly provided by Novartis Pharma. D425Med human medulloblastoma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. D341Med and D425Med human medulloblastoma cells were the kind gift of Dr Henry Friedman (Duke University). All medulloblastoma cells were cultured in Richter's zinc option medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (nonessential amino acids were added to the medium of D341Med and D425Med cells to a final concentration of 1%). All cell cultures were maintained at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2. For in vitro assays, a stock solution (1 mM) of patupilone was prepared in DMSO and further diluted with water/DMSO- and serum-containing media. Irradiation was performed at room temperature, using a Pantak Therapax 300 kV X-ray unit at 0.7 Gy/min. 3-Methyladenine (Sigma) was prepared in water at a stock solution of 100 mM and further diluted in serum-containing media. Bafilomycin-1 (Sigma) was prepared in DMSO at a stock solution of 100 \u00a5\u00ecM and further diluted in serum-containing media. The broad-range caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (Calbiochem; Merck Chemicals) was prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 10 \u00a5\u00ecM and further diluted in serum-containing media. Cell Proliferation, Clonogenic Cell Survival, and Cell Viability Assay. Proliferative activity was assessed in 96-well F-plates using the Alamar Blue (Biosource International) and MTS assays (Promega). Absorption was measured at 570 and 630 nm (Alamar blue) using a GenTec spectrophotometer or at 490 nm (MTS) using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). 19, 30, 31 The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values were calculated from the regression curve using GraphPad Prism software, version 4 (GraphPad Software). 30 Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate. For the cell viability assay, 400 000 or 500 000 cells were seeded and treated 24 h thereafter. Cell viability was determined 72 h after treatment began using the trypan blue exclusion assay. Each experiment was performed at least in duplicate. To determine clonogenic cell survival, the number of single-seeded cells was adjusted to obtain 100 colonies per cell culture dish with a given treatment. After treatment with different regimens, cells were maintained at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 and allowed to grow for 14 days before fixation in methanol/acetic acid (ratio, 75%:25%) and staining with crystal violet. Only colonies with >50 cells/colony were counted. For combined treatment, cells were pre-incubated with patupilone or control solution 1 h before irradiation. Clonogenic cell survival assays were repeated as independent experiments at least twice. Cell-Cycle Analysis. For cell-cycle analysis, medulloblastoma cells were treated with patupilone for 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively. Both floating and adherent cells were collected. After washing twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL) (Becton-Dickinson) in PBS containing 100 U/mL RNase A (Qiagen) for 30 min at room temperature. The percentage of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle was determined by evaluating DNA content, as described elsewhere. 30, 31 Caspase-3 Activity Assay. Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD)ase activity was determined in cytosolic cell extracts. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of patupilone for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Cells were harvested thereafter by trypsin/EDTA, centrifuged, and washed with precooled PBS. The cell pellet was suspended in 5 volumes of precooled buffer A (20 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.5], 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM sodium EDTA, 1 mM sodium EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DDT], 250 mM sucrose, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF] supplemented with protease inhibitors [5 mg/mL pepstatin A, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, 2 mg/mL aprotinin, 2 mg/mL DTT, and 1 mM of PMSF]). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the cells were disrupted by freezing and thawing. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min at 4\u00a1\u00c6C, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100 000g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant (S-100 fraction) was stored at ?80\u00a1\u00c6C. To determine caspase 3-like activity, 75 \u00a5\u00ecg of protein from the S-100 fraction was incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C with the colorimetric caspase 3 substrate N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp p-nitroanilide (100 mM; Ac-DEVD-pNA; Calbiochem) and 1 mM dATP in a final volume of 120 \u00a5\u00ecL. Cleavage of the caspase substrate was monitored at 405 nm using a GenTec spectrophotometer. Detection and Quantification of Acidic Vesicular Organelles (AVOs) with Acridine Orange. To detect and quantify AVOs, cellular vital staining with acridine orange was performed. In acridine orange-stained cells, the cytoplasm and nucleolus fluoresce bright green and dim red, whereas the acidic compartments fluoresce bright red. 32 The intensity of the red fluorescence isproportional to the degree of acidity and/or the volume of the cellular acidic compartment and was measured 6, 12, 24, and 48 hafter exposure to patupilone alone or 48 h after treatment with patupilone combined with ionizing radiation. After treatment with patupilone alone or in combination with irradiation, both adherent and suspended cells were stained at the indicated time points with acridine orange (1 mg/mL) for a period of 15 min, harvested by trypsin/EDTA, and collected in PBS. As a negative control, 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecM bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) was added 30 min before acridine orange staining. Green (510?530 nm) and red (465 nm) fluorescence emission from 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells illuminated with blue (488 nm) excitation light was measured with a FACS Calibur from Becton Dickinson using CellQuest software. The ratio of red to green fluorescence was determined in control and treated cells and normalized in relation to untreated cells. Tumor Xenograft in Nude Mice and Application of Treatment Regimes. D425Med cells (6 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6) were injected subcutaneously on the backs of 4?6-week-old athymic nude mice. Tumor volumes were determined from caliper measurements of tumor length (L) and width (l) according to the formula (L x l 2)/2. Tumors were allowed to expand to a volume of 200 mm 3 (\u00a1\u00be10%) before treatment start. With the use of a customized shielding device, mice were given strictly loco regional radiotherapy of 3 \u00a1\u00bf 3 Gy on 3 consecutive days using a Gulmay 200 kV X-ray unit at 100 cGy/min at room temperature. Patupilone (2 mg/kg; dissolved in 30% PEG-300/70% saline) was applied intravenously 24 h before the first treatment with ionizing radiation (at day 0 of the treatment; n= 5 per group). Tumor growth was monitored daily. Results. Patupilone Strongly Reduces Proliferation and Viability in Human p53wt and p53mt Medulloblastoma Cell Lines. The antiproliferative effect of the microtubule-stabilizing agent patupilone was tested in the 3 representative human medulloblastoma cell lines D341Med, D425Med, and DAOY. Patupilone reduced the proliferative activity in the D341 cell line, with an IC 50 of 0.53 nM (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45?0.62) (Fig.?1A); in the D425Med cell line, with an IC 50 of 0.37 nM (95% CI, 0.14?0.96) (Fig.?1B); and in the DAOY cell line, with an IC 50 of 0.19 nM (95% CI, 0.12?0.29) (Fig.?1C). Likewise, cell viability, as detected by trypan blue exclusion, was reduced to 50% when treated with subnanomolar concentrations of patupilone (D341Med, 0.25 nM; D425Med and DAOY, 0.1 nM) (Fig.?1D?F). Of note, up to 10-fold higher IC 50 values were obtained when the different cell lines were treated with the microtubule-destabilizing agent vincristine (Supplement 1). Next, clonogenic cell survival was determined in the 3 cell lines after treatment with increasing concentrations of patupilone. In the D341Med cell line, the effect of patupilone on clonogenic survival was at dose range of patupilone similar to the level of proliferative activity and viability (IC 50, 0.50?0.75 nM). However, the clonogenicity of D425Med and DAOY cells was already strongly reduced at a 10-fold lower concentration of patupilone (IC 50, 30 pM) (Fig.?1G, H). These results overall demonstrate that patupilone is highly potent against different medulloblastoma cell lines. These medulloblastoma cell lines differ in the expression of and mutations in specific genes (eg, p53, c-myc). However, a differential treatment sensitivity so far cannot be attributed to a specific genetic background. 21 Patupilone Sequentially Induces a G2-M-Phase Arrest and Apoptosis in Medulloblastoma Cell Lines. To investigate patupilone-induced alterations of cell cycle progression, we determined the cell-cycle distribution over time in the 3 medulloblastoma cell lines following treatment with low and high concentrations of patupilone (0.1?1 nM). Low-dose treatment with patupilone resulted in minor changes in cell-cycle distribution in all 3 cell lines but also in a small accumulation of cells in a sub-G1-peak in the D341Med and D425Med cell population, which is indicative of apoptosis. On the other hand, exposure to increased concentrations of patupilone resulted in extended G2-M-phase accumulation in all 3 medullobastoma cell lines (D341Med and DAOY cell lines, 1 nM; D425Med cell line, 0.5 nM patupilone) (Fig.?2). Twelve hours after patupilone exposure, 33.3% (D341Med), 40.6% (D425Med), and 46.2% (DAOY) of cells were accumulated in the G2-M phase, compared with 16.5% (D341Med), 26.3% (D425Med), and 17.5% (DAOY) of the untreated cell populations (see Table?I). Accumulation of cells in the G2-M phase was most prominent in the DAOY cell line, probably because of an inactive G1 checkpoint. After the patupilone-induced G2-M-phase redistribution, extended accumulation of cells in a subG1-peak was observed in the D341Med and DAOY cells after treatment with 1 nM patupilone and in the D425Med cells after treatment with 0.5 nM of patupilone, again indicative of patupilone-induced, late apoptosis. These results demonstrate a dose-dependent sequential antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect of patupilone in the medulloblastoma cell lines. Patupilone Induces Apoptosis and Autophagy in Medulloblastoma Cell Lines. To further investigate patupilone-induced apoptosis, caspase-3 activity was assessed in the 3 medulloblastoma cell lines treated with the same concentrations as used for FACS analysis (see above). Caspase-3 activity was increased over time in the D425Med and the DAOY cell lines (Fig.?3B and 3C) and, to a smaller extent, in the D341Med cell line, reflecting the outcome of subG1-accumulation, as obtained by FACS analysis (Fig.?3A). Of note, pretreatment with the broad-range caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK did not rescue D425Med or DAOY cell lines from undergoing cell death, as assessed by the trypan blue viability assay (data not shown). Comparable treatment sensitivity but a reduced amount of apoptosis in the D341Med cell line suggested another form of cell death induced by patupilone in this cell line. As a marker for autophagy, the fractional volume of acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) in control and patupilone-treated cells was quantified. A time-dependent increase in the amount of AVOs was exclusively observed in the D341Med (Fig.?3D) but not in the D425Med and DAOY medulloblastoma cell lines (Fig.?3E and ?and3F).3F). To inhibit the autophagic process induced by patupilone, cells were pretreated with bafilomycin A1, which prevents the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. High concentrations of bafilomycin A1 alone (100 nM) were not toxic to the D341Med cells, but interestingly, pretreatment with bafilomycin A1 strongly sensitized D341Med cells to patupilone (0.5 nM), resulting in nearly 100% dead cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). To determine a putative switch to apoptotic cell death after inhibition of autophagy, caspase-3 activity was assessed in cells pretreated with bafilomycin A1. No additional increase in caspase-3 activity could be detected after patupilone treatment (data not shown). These results suggest that after a G2-M-phase arrest, patupilone induces late apoptosis in the medulloblastoma cell lines D425Med and DAOY. On the other hand, D341Med cells are apoptosis resistant, and patupilone-induced autophagy might initially protect these cells from undergoing cell death not related to apoptosis. Patupilone Sensitizes Medulloblastoma Cell Lines to Ionizing Radiation. Patupilone is a promising agent for combined treatment with ionizing radiation. We therefore investigated its antitumor effect in these 3 medulloblastoma cell lines in combination with increasing doses of ionizing radiation. The D341Med cell line was clearly more radiosensitive than the D425Med and DAOY cell lines with regard to the level of proliferative activity, viability, and clonogenic survival (Fig.?4A?C). On the level of the short-term end points (ie, proliferative capacity and viability), the combined treatment modality induced an additive effect in the D341Med cell line but not in the D425Med and DAOY cell lines (Fig.?4A?F). More important, combined treatment reduced clonogenicity in all cell lines in an at least additive and comparable extent. As expected from the response to patupilone alone (see above), the D425Med and DAOY cell lines were sensitized to ionizing radiation at a 10-fold lower concentration of patupilone, compared with the D341Med cells (Fig.?4G?I). On the basis of the additive effects of combined treatment on the level of cell viability and clonogenicity, caspase-3 activity and the fractional volume of acidic vesicular organelles were determined in response to treatment. Caspase-3 activity in response to irradiation was least induced in the DAOY cells; however, no additive caspase-3 activation could be observed in all 3 cell lines in response to combined treatment with ionizing radiation (Fig.?5A?C). The autophagy-related end point was most prominently induced in the D341Med cell line in response to irradiation (Fig.?5D?F); however, a minor additive effect could only be detected in the D425Med cell line in response to the combined treatment modality. Overall, these data demonstrate that patupilone enhances the effect of ionizing radiation in human medulloblastoma cell lines with regard to viability and clonogenicity. However, combined treatment of these meduloblastoma cell lines does not result in enhanced amounts of apoptosis or autophagy in these cell lines. Radiosensitizing Effect of Patupilone on Tumor Xenografts. To determine an at least additive effect of the combined treatment modality in vivo, a combined treatment regimen with patupilone and ionizing radiation was tested against xenografts derived from human D425Med medulloblastoma cells, which were subcutaneously injected into the backs of nude mice. Treatment was started when tumors reached a minimal size of 200 mm 3 \u00a1\u00be 10% (on days 20?27 after cell injection). In vivo studies were performed with loco regional application of ionizing radiation using a shielding device and a minimal fractionated treatment regimen of 3 Gy on 3 consecutive days. This daily dose is applied when fractionated radiotherapy is used for the treatment of human malignancies. For practical reasons only 3 fractions were chosen as the treatment regimen, but the response to such a regimen was previously found to be useful for treatment evaluation. 19 Fig.?6 summarizes the effect of tumor treatment with patupilone alone (2 mg/kg patupilone once), ionizing radiation alone (vehicle combined with 3 \u00a1\u00bf 3 Gy), and patupilone and ionizing radiation in combination (2 mg/kg once combined with 3 \u00a1\u00bf 3 Gy), compared with a vehicle alone?treated control group. Patupilone was applied 24 h before the first of 3 fractions of irradiation applied on 3 consecutive days. Determination of treatment-related body weight changes did not reveal a patupilone-dependent transient weight loss after patupilone application (data not shown), and no skin changes or tissue damage were observed in the co-irradiated healthy tissue area around the tumor during the follow-up period of tumor growth. Treatment with patupilone or ionizing radiation alone resulted in a partial tumor growth suppression over 10 days, whereas combined treatment exerted a strong supra-additive tumor growth control, with complete tumor regression in the follow-up period (P< .005, for ionizing radiation or patupilone alone vs combined treatment) (Fig.?6). Interestingly, tumors only slowly regressed after the end of treatment, coinciding with the in vitro results that treatment-induced apoptosis might only play a minor role for the treatment response of these medulloblastoma cells to ionizing radiation and patupilone. Complete visible tumor regression was observed in all mice treated with the combined treatment modality. In 2 of 5 mice, slow-growing tumor recurrences could be observed 25?30 days after the start of treatment. No recurrences at all occurred in the remaining cohort of mice treated with the combined treatment modality (data not shown). Overall, these results demonstrate that patupilone might be a promising alternative for a combined treatment regimen using microtubule inhibitors and ionizing radiation. Discussion. Vincristine-associated side effects in medulloblastoma have led to an intense search for novel microtubule-interfering agents with radiosensitizing potential and devoid of toxicities. Here, we investigated the effect of the novel clinically relevant microtubule inhibitor patupilone alone and in combination with ionizing radiation on 3 human medulloblastoma cell lines and determined a strong cytotoxic potency of patupilone at picomolar concentrations. Importantly, patupilone was 10-fold more potent than vincristine at inhibiting proliferation at subnanomolar concentrations (IC 50 for patupilone, 0.1?0.25 nM; IC 50 for vincristine, 1?1.4 nM) in all medulloblastoma cell lines tested. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that patupilone sequentially induced a strong G2-M-phase arrest in all cell lines, followed by signs of apoptosis in the 2 medulloblastoma cell lines D425Med and DAOY. In combination with ionizing radiation, an at least additive cytotoxic effect against both radiation-susceptible and radiation-resistant medulloblastoma tumor cell lines was observed. These results demonstrate a potent cytotoxic effect of patupilone alone and in combination with ionizing radiation, and they suggest that such a combined treatment modality qualifies for additional preclinical and clinical testing in medulloblastoma. Patupilone and other epothilone-derivatives are currently being tested in clinical phase II/III trials in adults, and there is an ongoing phase I/II trial of combined treatment with patupilone and radiotherapy in brain tumors. We previously investigated the cytotoxic effect of patupilone alone or as part of a combined treatment modality with ionizing radiation against tumor cells derived from different tumor entities. Interestingly, the combination of patupilone with ionizing radiation resulted only in an additive cytotoxic effect against various cancer cell types only in vitro, but it resulted in a supra-additive tumor growth delay when tested against tumor xenografts derived from the same tumor cells as those tested in vitro. 18, 19 To the same extent, we could also now demonstrate an at least additive effect on combined treatment in the medulloblastoma cell lines in vitro and, more important, a strong supra-additive treatment response, including complete tumor regressions in tumor xenografts treated with a minimal combined treatment regimen in vivo. The accumulation of tumor cells in the most radiosensitive G2-M phase of the cell cycle represents the major rational for the sensitization to ionizing radiation, 22? 24 although other, S-phase progression-related mechanisms have also been observed. 19 Additional anti-vascular and anti-angiogenic effects might contribute to the supra-additive tumor growth delay observed in vivo, and in fact, direct targeting of endothelial cells 25? 27 and indirect, anti-angiogenic interference with the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors from tumor cells have been proposed. Interestingly, the semisynthetic epithilone B derivative ixabepilone has previously been investigated against several pediatric cancer models and revealed broad-spectrum activity. 15 To our knowledge, this is the first report to have investigated the potency of patupilone alone and in combination with ionizing radiation in medulloblastoma cell lines and tumor xenografts, and we observed a differential cell line?dependent response with regard to the patupilone-induced mode of cell death. A strong G2-M-phase arrest was induced in all cell lines by patupilone 6 and 12 h after the commencement of treatment with low subnanomolar concentrations (0.1?1 nM). However, we also observed an initial longer-lasting accumulation of cells in the radioresistant S-phase in D425Med and D341 cell lines (data not shown), as previously manifested in other tumor cells in response to low-dose treatment with patupilone. 19 The combined treatment with ionizing radiation in all cell lines resulted in an at least additive cytotoxic effect. After G2-M-phase arrest, patupilone potently induced apoptosis in the D425Med and the DAOY medulloblastoma cell lines, as indicated by caspase-3 activation and the occurrence of a subG1-peak cell population by flow cytometry. The D341Med medulloblastoma cell line was less susceptible to patupilone in terms of proliferation, clonogenic cell survival, and the apoptosis level, with an IC 50 of patupilone 10-fold higher than the IC 50 for the 2 other medulloblastoma cell lines. Interestingly, the fractional volume of patupilone-induced acidic vesicular organelles was increased in this cell line versus the other 2 cell lines, indicating an enhanced patupilone-dependent autophagic process. These medulloblastoma cell lines differ in their expression level and mutations of specific genes; however, a differential treatment sensitivity thus far could not be attributed to a specific genetic background. 21 In addition to apoptosis, several additional cell death pathways exist, such as autophagy, necrosis, senescence, and mitotic catastrophe. Autophagy, which is also called self-cannibalism, includes the degradation and recycling of intracellular proteins and small organelles. Autophagy may protect cells under the condition of environmental stress but may also lead to cell death. Patupilone?only induced autophagy-related acidic vacuolar organelles in the D341Med cells, which were also less susceptible to patupilone, compared with the 2 other medulloblastoma cell lines. Interestingly, interference with autophagy sensitized cells to patupilone-induced cell death, indicating that autophagy acts as a cell-protective rather than a cell death?related response to patupilone in these cells. However, how microtubule-stabilizing agents promote autophagy on the molecular level is far from clear. Only recently, a novel functional link has been suggested between autophagy and microtubules that is relevant for the cellular redistribution of the autophagy related LC3-protein and coordinated fusion of lysosomes and autophagosomes. 28 Microtubule inhibitors and ionizing radiation also induce mitotic catastrophe as a mode of cell death, 29 because they result in aberrant chromosomal segregation and failed mitosis. Treatment with patupilone led to a strong accumulation of cells in G2-M and multinucleation, as indicators for mitotic catastrophe, which has been identified in all 3 medulloblastoma cell lines (data not shown). Treatment-induced mitotic catastrophe can also trigger other late cell death end points, including apoptosis and independent of the original cytotoxic insult. Thus, we cannot exclude that patupilone-induced apoptosis in the medulloblastoma cells is a secondary end point and that the cells have already undergone mitotic catastrophe. Because pretreatment of cells with the broad-range caspase inhibitor did not reduce patupilone-induced cell viability, activation of apoptosis-related end points might indeed represent a secondary mode of cell death. Overall, we demonstrated that patupilone is a very potent cytotoxic agent against several medulloblastoma cells lines, strongly reduces clonogenic survival alone and in combination with ionizing radiation, and induces different modes of cell death in a cell-line-dependent way. The strong treatment response also determined in vivo against tumor xenografts suggests that patupilone is a promising agent for combined treatment modality instead of vincristine and merits further preclinical investigation and eventually clinical evaluation.

A synergistic effect resulting from a combination of BCL2 and MYC or MYC and CCND1 has been implicated in human B-cell lymphomas. Although the identification of other cooperative genes involved is important, our present understanding of such genes remains scant. The objective of this study was to identify the additional cooperative gene(s) associated with BCL2 and MYC or MYC and CCND1. First, we assessed whether Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 could cooperate. Next, we developed a synergism-based functional screening method for the identification of other oncogene(s) that act with Bcl2 and Myc. Design and Methods. Growth in culture, colony formation and oncogenicity in vivo were assessed in mouse primary B cells exogenously expressing various combinations of Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1. For the functional screening, Bcl2- and Myc-expressing primary B cells were infected with a retroviral cDNA library. Inserted cDNA of transformed cells in culture were then identified. Results. Primary B cells exogenously expressing Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 showed factor-independent growth ability, enhanced colony-forming capability and aggressive oncogenicity, unlike the cases observed with the expression of any combination of only two of the genes. We identified CCND3 and NRAS as cooperative genes with Bcl2 and Myc through the functional screening. Conclusions. Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 or Bcl2, Myc and CCND3 synergistically transformed mouse primary B cells into aggressive malignant cells. Our new synergism-based method is useful for the identification of synergistic gene combinations in tumor development, and may expand our systemic understanding of a wide range of cancer-causing elements. Introduction. Intense efforts to examine genetic alterations in human cancer have provided a catalogue of cancer-causing genes. It is speculated that most cancers arise as a result of accumulation of altered cancer-causing genes. The study of functional synergism among cancer-causing genes is thus becoming one of the central issues in cancer research. 1 However, it is difficult to determine which combinations of genes are involved in oncogenesis because of the large number of possible candidates. This accounts for the fact that our knowledge about synergistic combinations of cancer-causing genes has remained limited. Genetic alterations of BCL2 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2), MYC [v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian)] and CCND1 (cyclin D1) are the most frequently found alterations in human B-cell lymphomas. These genes are transcriptionally deregulated as the partner genes of IgH translocation, and are thus thought to perform crucial roles in human B-cell lymphomagenesis. 2 A synergistic effect resulting from a combination of two genes from BCL2, MYC and CCND1 has been implicated in human B-cell lymphomagenesis. About 4% of cases of diffuse large B-cell cell lymphoma possess BCL2/MYC double translocations, suggesting a synergistic effect of BCL2 and MYC in lymphoma development. 3 ? 7 The synergistic effect of BCL2 and MYC has also been implicated in the histological and clinical transformation of indolent follicular lymphoma into a more aggressive lymphoma. 8 ? 12 Cases of CCND1/MYC double translocation are relatively frequent in mantle cell lymphoma. 7 Importantly, it is believed that other hitherto unknown genes also play important roles in lymphomagenesis in addition to the synergistic effects of the aforementioned two oncogenes since human B-cell lymphomas often show a variety of genes subject to alterations and/or deregulated expression. 7 That multiple genes are involved in human lymphoma formation has also been suggested by experimental mouse models. Cory et al. pointed out that additional genetic alterations were involved in lymphoma development in an Emu mouse model ectopically expressing Myc and Bcl2. 13 The identification and clarification of the multiple cooperative genes implicated in human lymphoma formation is important, although our present understanding of such genes remains scant. The objective of this study was to identify additional cooperative gene(s) associated with BCL2 and MYC or MYC and CCND1 in human B-cell lymphomagenesis. Importantly, human B-cell lymphoma cases with concurrent multiple translocations including BCL2, MYC and CCND1 have been reported. 14 , 15 Given the different biological functions of BCL2, MYC and CCND1, 16 ? 20 we investigated the possibility that these three genes might act synergistically. In vitro assays demonstrated that ectopic expression of all three genes could transform mouse primary B-cells, unlike the cases observed following the expression of any combination of only two of the three genes. We also determined that this synergistic effect contributed to lethal tumor development in mice. Furthermore, we used these findings to develop a new functional screening method, with which we were able to identify other transforming gene combinations. Design and Methods. Generation of retrovirus. Retroviral vector plasmids were transiently co-transfected with MCV-Ecopac vector 21 (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Van Etten, Tufts-NEMC Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA) into 293 T cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Profection mammalian transfection system; Promega) or the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturers\u00a1\u00af instructions. Twenty-four hours following transfection, the culture medium was replaced with Feeder medium [Iscove\u00a1\u00afs modified Dulbecco\u00a1\u00afs medium (IMDM) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) containing 2- mercaptoethanol (5\u00a1\u00bf10 ?5 M; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and Primatone RL (0.03% wt/vol; Cellgro) with interleukin-7 [IL-7; 5% of mouse IL-7-producing cell line J558 supernatant (kindly provided by Dr. Tariq Enver, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK)]. Cells were incubated at 32\u00a1\u00c6C for 24 h before harvesting of the virus supernatants. The virus supernatants were filtered (0.45 \u00a5\u00ecM) and then frozen at ?80\u00a1\u00c6C. Preparation and retroviral infection of cells. On day 15 or 16 of gestation, fetal liver cells were enriched to produce pro B-cells by cell sorting for B220 and c-Kit expression, and cultured at 5\u00a1\u00bf10 3 /mL in Feeder medium containing IL-7 (5%) on 15 Gy-irradiated ST-2 stromal cells. Following pro B-cell growth for 3?4 days, cells were used for retroviral infection. Cells (1.25 \u00a1\u00bf10 5) were plated onto ST-2 cells in a 6-well culture plate (Costar). After 24 h, cells were suspended in virus supernatant and spin infected at 2000 rpm (840g, 1.5 h) at room temperature. For drug selection, cells were serially infected with various retroviral vectors and then purified by serial selection using neomycin (1.2?2 mg/mL), hygromycin (0.3?1.5 mg/mL) and blasticidin (15?20 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL). For cell sorting, cells were simultaneously infected with various retroviral vectors and sorted for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and huKO expression after 2 or 3 days. In Screening 2, cells were infected with MSCV-Bcl2-pgk-Myc-ires-GFP and sorted for GFP expression. The combination of retroviral vectors used for establishing the various stable integrants are detailed in Online Supplementary Figure S1. In vitro liquid assays. Prior to commencement of the in vitro liquid assay without IL-7 and ST-2 cells, cell samples were washed twice in Feeder medium. Cells (1\u00a1\u00bf10 5 or 5\u00a1\u00bf10 5) were seeded into wells of a 24-well plate on day 0. In vitro colony-forming assays. Cells were plated in triplicate onto 35-mm dishes in 1 mL of semisolid, 1% methylcellulose-based medium supplemented with FCS (30%), mouse stem cell factor (SCF, 5% of mouse SCF producing a cell line supernatant), mouse IL-7 (5%), and mouse FLT3 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3) ligand (10 ng/mL; 250?31L, Peprotech) In vivo transplantation assays. Cells (1\u00a1\u00bf10 7) were transplanted intravenously into SCID mice. Cell suspensions of spleen or lymph nodes were obtained by pressing the tissue gently between two glass microscope slides and then treating the sample with ACK (0.15 M NH4Cl, 1.0 mM KHCO3 and 0.1 mM EDTA) to lyse the red blood cells. Tissues were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Experiments were performed with the approval of the Institutional Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments of Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute. Construction of the retroviral cDNA expression library and screening. Construction of the retroviral cDNA expression library was performed as previously described. 22 In brief, a double-stranded cDNA longer than 1.0 kb obtained from the SU-DHL-6 cell line was ligated into a BstXI digested pMXs vector. These procedures allowed the use of an endogenous stop codon of each gene in this expression library system. Escherichia coli DH10B was transformed by electroporation, resulting in the production of about 1.0\u00a1\u00bf10 6 clones. To obtain the results from functional screenings, the inserted cDNA were recovered by PCR-amplification using the retroviral-specific primers (S: 5\u00a1\u00c7-GGTGGACCATCCTCTAGACT-3\u00a1\u00c7, AS: 5\u00a1\u00c7-CCCTTTTTCTGGAGACTAAAT-3\u00a1\u00c7) from the retrovirus-integrated genomic DNA of proliferating cells. Anti-sense oriented cDNA clones were excluded from analysis in this study. Statistical analysis. Mean values \u00a1\u00be s.e.m. were used throughout. Data were analyzed using the Student\u00a1\u00afs t-test and Kaplan?Meier survival analysis was conducted using Statview software (SAS Institute). Further details on the construction of vectors, flow cytometry, Southern blot analysis and analysis of expression microarray data are provided in the Online Supplementary Design and Methods. Results. In vitro growth of primary B cells with deregulated expression of IgH translocation-associated oncogenes. A defining characteristic of the transformed cell in vitro is the lack of dependency on exogenous proliferating and/or survival signals. As BALB/c fetal liver-derived pro B-cells could be cultured for over 6 months in the presence of IL-7 on ST-2 stromal cells, 23 , 24 our initial efforts focused on identifying oncogenes that impart B cells independence from IL-7 and ST-2 cells. We infected primary B cells with retrovirus containing one oncogene (Bcl2, Myc or Ccnd1) and a drug selection marker. Drug-selected cells with a single gene could not proliferate in the absence of IL-7 and ST-2 cells (data not shown). All combinations comprising two genes from Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 were also unable to transform primary B cells (Figure 1A, Experiment (EXP) 1, see also Online Supplementary Figure S1 for vector constructions and stable integrants). In marked contrast, primary B cells stably expressing Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 (Online Supplementary Figure S2A) showed stable growth in the absence of IL-7 and ST-2 cells (Figure 1A, EXP 1). These findings were reproducible (Figure 1A, EXP 2). To confirm these initial results, primary B cells stably expressing exogenous Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 were established with a non-drug selection method. We simultaneously infected primary B cells with two vectors. One vector co-expressed Bcl2, Myc and GFP (MSCV-Bcl2-pgk-Myc-ires-GFP) 25 and the other vector co-expressed Ccnd1 and humanized Kusabira-Orange (huKO) 26 (pGCDNsam-Ccnd1-ires-huKO) (Online Supplementary Figure S1). GFP and huKO double-positive cells were purified by cell sorting and designated as \u00a1\u00b0Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1\u00a1\u00b1. Ectopic expression of BCL2, MYC and CCND1 proteins in Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1 cells was confirmed by western blot analysis (Online Supplementary Figure S3). This procedure allows for faster purification of the stable integrant compared to the drug selection method, and hence minimizes uncontrollable factors that may have additive effects on cellular transformation. Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1 cells could grow in the absence of IL-7 and ST-2 cells, unlike Bcl2/Myc/mock cells (Figure 1B, EXP 1, see also Online Supplementary Figure S1 for vector constructions and stable integrants). Other stable integrants stably expressing all three genes (\u00a1\u00b0Ccnd1/Myc/Bcl2\u00a1\u00b1 and \u00a1\u00b0Bcl2/Ccnd1/Myc\u00a1\u00b1) were also established (see Online Supplementary Figure S1 for vector constructions and stable integrants and Online Supplementary Figure S3 for protein expression). As expected, both Ccnd1/Myc/Bcl2 and Bcl2/Ccnd1/Myc cells could grow in the absence of IL-7 and ST-2 cells, unlike Ccnd1/Myc/mock and Bcl2/Ccnd1/mock cells (Figure 1B, EXP 1). Reproducibility was demonstrated by an independent experiment (Figure 1B, EXP 2). These results confirmed that ectopic expression of Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 could synergistically transform primary B cells to gain independence from IL-7 and ST-2 cells. Enhanced colony-forming efficiency of primary B cells with deregulated expression of Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 in a methylcellulose matrix. The ability to form colonies in semisolid media is another characteristic feature of transformed cells. As drug-selected stable integrants expressing the three genes formed more colonies than those expressing any combination comprising only two of the genes (Online Supplementary Figures S2B,C and S4), we confirmed these results using sorted stable integrants. In the first plating, Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1, Ccnd1/Myc/Bcl2 and Bcl2/Ccnd1/Myc cells showed statistically significant more efficient colony formation than Bcl2/Myc/mock, Ccnd1/Myc/mock and Bcl2/Ccnd1/mock, respectively (Figure 1C, EXP 1, and D). In the re-plating, cells expressing any combination of the two genes did not show any colonies, while Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1, Ccnd1/Myc/Bcl2 and Bcl2/Ccnd1/Myc cells formed a substantial number of colonies (Figure 1C, EXP 1). Similar results were obtained using an independent experiment (Figure 1C, EXP 2). These results indicate that the ectopic expression of Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 synergistically transforms primary B cells so that they acquire efficient colony-forming capability in a methylcellulose matrix. However, the colony-forming efficiency of the stable integrants with Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 was much lower than that of the human B-cell lymphoma cell lines SU-DHL-6 and Raji (Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1 25/10 5 (0.025%); Ccnd1/Myc/Bcl2 5/10 5 (0.005%); Bcl2/Ccnd1/Myc 141/10 5 (0.141%); SU-DHL-6 21/10 3 (2.1%); Raji 864/10 3 (86.4%) in the first plating). The contribution of deregulated expression of Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 in converting primary B cells into highly aggressive malignant cells. In an effort to examine whether the synergistic effect of Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 could contribute to tumor development, we transplanted 10 7 cells of the sorted stable integrants into non-irradiated SCID mice. SCID mice transplanted with Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1, Ccnd1/Myc/Bcl2 or Bcl2/Ccnd1/Myc cells developed fatal leukemia/lymphoma more rapidly than mice transplanted with cells containing only two of the oncogenes [Figure 2A, EXP 1, average survival time: 63.5 days for the cells expressing three genes (Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1, n=6; Ccnd1/Myc/Bcl2, n=6; and Bcl2/Ccnd1/Myc, n=6) versus 163.4 days for cells expressing two genes (Bcl2/Myc/mock, n=3; Ccnd1/Myc/mock, n=2 and Bcl2/Ccnd1/mock, n=3), P=0.0003; Figure 2B, EXP 1, average survival time: 51.3 days for Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1 versus 83.7 days for Bcl2/Myc/mock, P=0.0128; Figure 2C, EXP 1, 97.0 days for Ccnd1/Myc/Bcl2 versus 243.5 days for Ccnd1/Myc/mock, P=0.0319; Figure 2D, EXP 1, 42.2 days for Bcl2/Ccnd1/Myc versus 189.7 days for Bcl2/Ccnd1/mock, P=0.0051]. Dissections of two mice with Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1 and four mice with Bcl2/Ccnd1/Myc showed that GFP +huKO + tumor cells had mainly infiltrated the enlarged lymph nodes, spleen and thymus (Figure 2E,F), and bone marrow was also saturated with tumor cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of the surface markers of the malignant cells infiltrating lymph nodes indicated that they had an immature B-cell phenotype (pre B; c-Kit ?, B220 +, CD19 +, IgM ?). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA extracted from enlarged lymph nodes showed that all cases comprised one to several clonal IgH rearrangement(s) and that the patterns of IgH rearrangements among these cases differed (Figure 2G, lanes 4,5,7?10). Reproducibility was determined using an independent experiment (Figure 2A-D, EXP 2). Consistent results were also obtained when drug-selected stable integrants were transplanted into SCID mice (Figure 2H). All of these findings obtained with our in vivo mouse model clearly indicate that ectopic expression of Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 can transform primary B cells so that they develop a highly aggressive malignant potential. Screening a retroviral cDNA expression library to identify functional genes cooperating with Bcl2 and Myc in human B-cell lymphoma. Having established that the synergistic effect of the IgH translocation-associated oncogenes Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 could transform mouse primary B cells both in vitro and in vivo, we then utilized this system in an effort to identify other oncogenes which might cooperate with Bcl2 and Myc in transforming mouse primary B cells in vitro. Bcl2-and Myc-expressing primary B cells newly established using the drug selection or cell sorting methods were used for Screening 1 or Screening 2, respectively (Figure 3A,B). Cells expressing Bcl2 and Myc were infected with a retro-viral library expressing cDNA from SU-DHL-6, a human B-cell lymphoma cell line with the BCL2/IgH translocation (Figure 3C), followed by initiation of functional screening, in which the infected cells were cultured in the absence of IL-7 and ST-2 cells (Figure 3D). Retroviral library-infected cells showed robust proliferation for about 10 days (Screening 1) and for 2 to 5 weeks (Screening 2) following library infection, unlike the mock-infected cells (Figure 3E). We recovered the inserted cDNA from retrovirus-integrated genomic DNA of the proliferating cells. This process resulted in the identification of CCND3, NRAS and RNF14 in Screening 1, and CCND3, NRAS, PSAP and ASB8 in Screening 2 (Figure 3F). Of special note is that CCND3 and NRAS were identified in both screenings. The recovered sequence of NRAS contained a missense mutation in codon 61 (Q61K), and we confirmed that SU-DHL-6 possessed the mutated NRAS allele. We also conducted another experiment to confirm these results. To this purpose, we established various stable integrants using the sorting method (see Online Supplementary Figure S1 for vector constructions and stable integrants). In the liquid culture assay without IL-7 and ST-2 cells, expression of CCND3 or NRAS (Q61K) led to the stable growth of primary B cells expressing combinations of Bcl2 and Myc (Figure 4A, Bcl2/Myc/CCND3 or Bcl2/Myc/NRAS), unlike the case with RNF14, PSAP or ASB8 (data not shown). Furthermore, cells expressing CCND3 and Myc (CCND3/Myc/mock) or Bcl2 and CCND3 (Bcl2/CCND3/mock) could not proliferate under the same culture conditions (Figure 4A). This led us to conclude that one of the genes (Bcl2, Myc or CCND3) is indispensable for the transformation of primary mouse B cells. We then determined whether ectopic expression of Bcl2, Myc and CCND3 or Bcl2, Myc and NRAS (Q61K) could transform primary B cells in a colony-forming assay. In the first plating of the methylcellulose colony assay, Bcl2/Myc/CCND3, CCND3/Myc/Bcl2 and Bcl2/CCND3/Myc cells showed more efficient colony formation than Bcl2/Myc/mock, CCND3/Myc/mock and Bcl2/CCND3/mock, respectively (Figure 4B,C). On re-plating, Bcl2/Myc/mock, CCND3/Myc/mock and Bcl2/CCND3/mock cells did not show any colony formation, while cells with the three genes expressing stable integrants (Bcl2/Myc/CCND3, CCND3/Myc/Bcl2 and Bcl2/CCND3/Myc) showed a higher number of colonies (Figure 4B). Moreover, Bcl2/Myc/NRAS cells formed colonies at a higher frequency than Bcl2/Myc/mock (Figure 4B). We also examined the synergistic effects of these gene combinations in the SCID transplantation model and found that Bcl2/Myc/CCND3, CCND3/Myc/Bcl2 and Bcl2/CCND3/Myc cells caused B-cell leukemia/lymphoma with shorter survival times than cells containing only two of the oncogenes [Figure 4D, cells expressing three genes (Bcl2/Myc/CCND3, n=3; CCND3/Myc/Bcl2 n=3; and Bcl2/CCND3/Myc, n=3) versus cells expressing two genes (Bcl2/Myc/mock, n=3; CCND3/Myc/mock, n=2; and Bcl2/CCND3/mock, n=2), P\u00a1\u00c20.0001; Figure 4E, Bcl2/Myc/CCND3 versus Bcl2/Myc/mock, P=0.0246; Figure 4F, CCND3/Myc/Bcl2 versus CCND3/Myc/mock, P=0.0643; Figure 4G, Bcl2/CCND3/Myc versus Bcl2/CCND3/mock, P=0.0645]. Bcl2/Myc/NRAS cells also killed SCID mice with an associated shorter survival time than Bcl2/Myc/mock cells (P=0.0224, Figure 4E). These findings confirmed that ectopic expression of Bcl2, Myc and CCND3 or Bcl2, Myc and NRAS (Q61K) can function synergistically to transform primary B cells into highly aggressive malignant cells. The available expression microarray data obtained from a public database also suggested that BCL2, MYC and CCND3 function synergistically and contribute to the histological transformation of some cases of human follicular lymphoma (Online Supplementary Figure S5). Expression microarray analysis to identify significant up- or down-regulated signaling pathways in cells expressing three genes compared to those expressing two genes. In order to investigate the deregulated pathways in the cells expressing three genes, expression microarray was employed using the stable integrants established by the cell sorting method in EXP 1 and the GSEA program with gene sets of canonical pathways. Twenty-six and 125 gene sets were significantly up- or down-regulated, respectively, in Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1 cells (nominal P value <0.05 and false discovery rate q-value <0.25) relative to Bcl2/Myc/mock cells (Online Supplementary Table 2A,B). The five gene sets with the most up-regulated normalized enrichment score (NES) included three muscle contraction-associated gene sets (Online Supplementary Table S2A, REACTOME_SMOOTH_MUSCLE_CONTRACTION, KEGG_VASCULAR_SMOOTH_MUSCLE_CONTRACTION and REACTOME_MUSCLE_CONTRACTION). The five gene sets with the most down-regulated NES included four translation-associated gene sets (Online Supplementary Table S2B; KEGG_RIBOSOME, REACTOME_PEPTIDE_CHAIN_ELONGATION, REACTOME_FORMATION_OF_A_POOL_OF_FREE_40S_SUB UNITS and REACTOME_VIRAL_MRNA_TRANSLATION). Fifty-seven and 78 gene sets were significantly up-or down-regulated, respectively, in Ccnd1/Myc/Bcl2 cells relative to Ccnd1/Myc/mock cells (Online Supplementary Table S2C, D). All of the five gene sets with the most up-regulated NES comprised translation-associated gene sets (Online Supplementary Table S2C). The five gene sets with the most down-regulated NES included three cell cycle-associated gene sets (Online Supplementary Table S2D; REACTOME_MITOTIC_M_M_G1_PHASES, REACTOME_CELL_CYCLE_MITOTIC and REACTOME_SCF_BETA_TRCP_MEDIATED_DEGRADATION_OF_EMI1). One hundred and fifty-two and 83 gene sets were significantly up- or down-regulated, respectively, in Bcl2/Ccnd1/Myc cells relative to Bcl2/Ccnd1/mock cells (Online Supplementary Table S2E,F). The five gene sets with the most up-regulated NES comprised translation-associated gene sets (Online Supplementary Table S2E). The five gene sets with the most down-regulated NES comprised cell surface receptor-associated gene sets (Online Supplementary Table S2F). This analysis did not show any gene sets which were commonly up- or down-regulated in all variants of the cells expressing three genes (Online Supplementary Table S2). In addition to the mRNA analysis, the protein expression of some selected genes was examined. It is known that a failure to induce senescence underlies the transformation process of some mouse primary cells. We performed western blot analysis to assess expression of senescence-associated proteins, including p53, p21, p16 and p27 and cytochemical staining of senescence-associated \u00a5\u00e2 galactosidase. We were not, however, able to show any differences between cells expressing three or two genes (data not shown). Discussion. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that the IgH translocation junction B-cell lymphoma oncogenes Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 function synergistically to transform mouse primary B cells into highly aggressive malignant cells. The transformation of primary mouse B cells could be induced in vitro by the exogenous introduction of all three genes. Transplanted cells ectopically expressing all three genes killed recipient mice more rapidly than those expressing any combination of two of the three genes. These findings provided direct evidence that the synergic effect contributed to lethal tumor development in mice, thus increasing our understanding of human B-cell lymphoma development. Importantly, there are reports of some cases of human B-cell lymphoma possessing concurrent BCL2, MYC and CCND1 translocations. 14 , 15 Our results strongly support the notion that BCL2, MYC and CCND1 can operate synergistically in the malignant processes related to these cases. Although cases involving a triple translocation of BCL2, MYC and CCND1 are rare, concurrent double translocations, especially of BCL2 and MYC, have been occasionally identified in cases of human B-cell lymphoma. 3 ? 7 It is possible that lymphoma cases with deregulated expression of BCL2 and MYC might have a cooperative genetic alteration which can substitute for CCND1. Based on such a hypothesis, we performed functional screening for genes cooperating with Bcl2 and Myc using 10 6 candidate cDNA clones of the retroviral SU-DHL-6 cDNA expression library. Through the screening, we not only identified mutated NRAS, one of the best-known oncogenes, but also CCND3. It was previously reported that CCND3 is recurrently, but infrequently, targeted by IgH translocations. 27 , 28 Moreover, it should be emphasized that we previously reported that CCND3 was the putative oncogene at the 6p21 gain/amplification region frequently found in human B-cell lymphomas. 29 Although many other reports have proposed that CCND3 is involved in human B-cell lymphomagenesis, 30 ? 34 no direct evidence for its involvement has been provided. To the best of our knowledge, our study has provided the first direct evidence that CCND3 can participate in the process of malignant transformation of primary B cells. Since it is well known that CCND1 and CCND3 share a redundant role, 35 , 36 our findings may imply that any of several genes involved in cell cycle regulation could has a synergistic effect in combination with Bcl2 and Myc on human B-cell lymphomagenesis. Our screenings picked up the NRAS cDNA sequence containing the missense mutation in codon 61 (Q61K). We could confirm the presence of the mutated NRAS allele in SU-DHL-6. Mutated Nras has been implicated in a minority of E-mu-myc mouse lymphomas. 37 However, mutated NRAS is unlikely to be the third cooperative gene acting with BCL2 and MYC in human B-cell lymphoma since it is well known that human B-cell lymphomas rarely have such mutations. 38 As shown in Figure 2G, the transplantation of polyclonal integrants expressing Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 into mice resulted in tumor development with one to several clonal IgH rearrangements. Figure 1C shows that only a limited cell population of integrants expressing Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 could form colonies, suggesting that an additional unknown gene or genes cooperating with Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 may further contribute to B-cell transformation. This notion has some credence given that human cases reported to possess BCL2, MYC and CCND1 translocations also harbored additional BCL6 translocations. 14 , 15 It is important to determine whether BCL6 and/or the other cooperative genes are necessary for human lymphoma formation. The stromal microenvironment plays an important role in lymphoma formation in vivo. 39 ? 41 Lymphoma cells escaping the influence of the microenvironment in vivo could mimic the synergism which we observed under the culture condition without IL-7 and ST-2 stromal cells in vitro, while it remains to be determined whether lymphoma cells under the influence of the microenvironment in vivo could mimic the synergism. In this context, it is important to note that we were able to identify some cases of histologically transformed follicular lymphoma which showed increased expression of MYC and CCND3 (Online Supplementary Figure S5). Further studies are needed to determine whether co-activation of BCL2, MYC and CCND3 affect the relationship between follicular lym-phoma cells and their microenvironment. GSEA was utilized in an effort to identify deregulated pathways which might be implicated in the synergistic effect of Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1. Many pathways were deregulated in Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1, Ccnd1/Myc/Bcl2 and Bcl2/Ccnd1/Myc cells relative to Bcl2/Myc/mock, Ccnd1/Myc/mock and Bcl2/Ccnd1/mock cells, respectively. Translation-associated pathways were significantly down-regulated in Bcl2/Myc/Ccnd1 cells and up-regulated in Ccnd1/Myc/Bcl2 and Bcl2/Ccnd1/Myc cells. We were unable to identify gene sets which were commonly deregulated in all variants of the cells expressing three genes. This may suggest that the synergistic effect of Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1 is not regulated by changes in mRNA expression but by changes in protein stability and/or modification. Further studies should provide important insights into the downstream processes associated with the synergistic effect of Bcl2, Myc and Ccnd1. The studied cells expressing three genes showed some minor variations in their response to the cell growth assays without IL-7 and ST-2, and considerable differences in their response to the colony-forming and in vivo assays. These variant cell types were established using different retroviral vectors, and thus the cells ectopically expressed different amounts of BCL2, MYC and CCND1 proteins (Online Supplementary Figure S3). These differences in protein expression may have affected the results of the in vitro and in vivo assays. However, it is important to note that all cell variants expressing three genes showed a malignant phenotype in every assay, relative to the respective control cells expressing two genes. In this study, we were able to identify cooperative oncogenes that act with Bcl2 and Myc on the basis of SU-DHL-6 retroviral cDNA library screening. The use of other cDNA libraries may facilitate the identification of other cooperative oncogenes and/or microRNA. The use of siRNA or shRNA libraries could enable the identification of cooperative suppressor oncogenes. Our synergism-based screening strategy could be useful in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In our preliminary study, we recurrently identified the TCL1A gene as a gene that cooperates with Bcl2 and Myc (data not shown). Our synergism-based functional analysis method is useful not only for the identification of hitherto unknown genes, but also for the identification of oncogenic synergisms with previously identified cancer-causing genes and microRNA, which may expand our systemic understanding of a wide range of cancer-causing elements. However, the method used in our study also selected pseudo-positive genes, suggesting that the method requires further improvement. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Abl interconnects oncogenic Met and p53 core pathways in cancer cells\tThe simplicity of BCR-ABL \u00a1\u00aeoncogene addiction' characterizing leukemia contrasts with the complexity of solid tumors where multiple \u00a1\u00aecore pathways', including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and p53, are often altered. This discrepancy illustrates the limited success of RTK antagonists in solid tumor treatment compared with the impact of Imatinib in BCR-ABL-dependent leukemia. Here, we identified c-Abl as a signaling node interconnecting Met-RTK and p53 core pathways, and showed that its inhibition impairs Met-dependent tumorigenesis. Met ensures cell survival through a new path in which c-Abl and p38-MAPK are employed to elicit p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392 and Mdm2 upregulation. We found a clinical correlation between activated Met, phospho-p53, and Mdm2 levels in human tumors, supporting the role of this path in tumorigenesis. Our findings introduce the concept that RTK-driven tumors may be therapeutically treated by hitting signaling nodes interconnecting core pathways. Moreover, they underline the importance of evaluating the relevance of c-Abl antagonists for combined therapies, based on the tumor signaling signature. It is well accepted that cancer is caused by genetic alterations of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and several signaling pathways through which these genes contributing to cancer act, have been uncovered. Recently, genome-wide profiling studies have revealed a remarkable heterogeneity of mutations among different patients affected by the same type of cancer. These studies have evidenced alteration of \u00a1\u00aecore pathways', which correspond to groups of proteins known to act together to form a signaling cascade and behave as a group of equivalence in which one mutation influences cell fate towards oncogenesis. 1, 2 However, it remains unclear whether genetic alterations of one core pathway functionally deregulate the others through the action of interconnecting nodes. Understanding this issue might offer the possibility of targeting these nodes, in addition to mutated signals within the core. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling is one core pathway frequently altered in cancer. Over recent years, therapeutic approaches based on compounds selectively targeting oncogenic RTKs, to which cells are dependent, have been developed. 3 However, the success of these strategies has been limited since inhibition of the \u00a1\u00aeprimary RTK addiction' triggers a selective pressure to acquire resistance through RTK switching. 4 As RTKs share several effectors that participate in the oncogenic process and in drug response, 5 an alternative strategy would rely on the identification of druggable signals required for RTK-triggered tumorigenesis. In contrast to the genetic complexity of solid tumors, most chronic myeloid leukemias (CML) and a subset of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) are caused by the oncoprotein BCR-ABL, to which cells are addicted for the execution of the oncogenic program. 6 The pivotal role of BCR-ABL in human leukemia has allowed the development of effective therapies using c-Abl-specific inhibitors such as Imatinib (Gleevec, Basel, Switzerland). 7 Although c-Abl activation by RTKs contributes to distinct biological responses, 8, 9 c-Abl oncogenic forms have been rarely identified in solid tumors. 10, 11 The still obscure role of c-Abl in this context is paralleled by the failure of using Abl antagonists for the treatment of solid tumors. 10, 11 It remains to be clarified whether a subset of tumors, identifiable by specific genetic or molecular signatures, would be highly sensitive to Abl inhibitors. In this study, we asked whether c-Abl is aberrantly instructed and integrated in signaling mechanisms triggered by oncogenic RTKs by exploring c-Abl requirement in Met-triggered tumorigenesis. The Met-RTK and its ligand HGF have essential functions during embryogenesis and regenerative processes by regulating cell migration, survival, proliferation, and differentiation, similar to Met functions during the oncogenic processes, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and effective Met antagonists have been identified. 4, 18, 19 Moreover, Met confers resistance to ErbB antagonists, as cancer cells use Met to maintain the RTK-driven oncogenic pathways active. 20, 21, 22 Here, we show that genetic and pharmacological knockdown of c-Abl impairs Met-triggered solid tumor formation in vivo. By investigating the molecular mechanism involved, we identified a novel signaling path by which c-Abl interconnects RTKs and p53 core pathways. In particular, we show that c-Abl activation by Met triggers p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392, which in turn drives the transcriptional upregulation of Mdm2 and protection from cell death. Finally, we uncovered a clinical correlation between aberrant Met activation, wild-type p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392, and Mdm2 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our findings elucidate a molecular mechanism by which c-Abl participates in the oncogenic program driven by RTKs and may disclose a novel signaling signature to identify patients whose treatment may benefit from c-Abl inhibition. Results. c-Abl is required for survival and anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells dependent on oncogenic Met. To study whether c-Abl is a signaling node in oncogenic processes triggered by RTKs, we used GTL-16 human gastric carcinoma cells, in which constitutively activated Met leads to Met dependency for cell survival, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo tumorigenesis. 23 We found that constitutive c-Abl phosphorylation on Tyr 412 was dependent on Met activity in GTL-16 cells (Figure 1a). Met-triggered survival of GTL-16 cells was significantly reduced by c-Abl antagonists, in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1b). c-Abl requirement downstream of Met for cell survival was further confirmed by using shRNA interference approach (Figures 1b and e), and found in other cancer cell lines. In particular, c-Abl phosphorylation on Tyr 412 was triggered by HGF in human HepG2 HCC cells (Supplementary Figure S1a) and c-Abl inhibition impaired HGF-induced HepG2 cell survival (Supplementary Figure S1b). Imatinib and Nilotinib also inhibit PDGFR and Kit, in addition to c-Abl, 7 but we excluded them as primary targets as they were not expressed in all cell types used in our studies (Supplementary Figures S1c and d). We next evaluated in GTL-16 cells whether c-Abl was required for Met-triggered anchorage-independent growth, which is a hallmark of oncogenic transformation. c-Abl inhibition, either pharmacologically, through shRNA interference, or by using a kinase dead form (Abl Kin?), 24 severely affected Met-triggered anchorage-independent growth in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 1c?e), indicating that c-Abl is required to execute the oncogenic transformation in cancer cells dependent on oncogenic Met. Inhibition of c-Abl interferes with Met-triggered tumor growth in vivo. We next evaluated the requirement of c-Abl in Met-triggered tumor growth in vivo by depleting c-Abl using shRNA plasmids (Figure 2a). We found that tumor growth caused by subcutaneous injection of HepG2 shAbl cells was significantly reduced compared with that induced by HepG2 control cells (Figures 2b and c), which tumorigenesis has been demonstrated to be dependent on Met. 25 Similarly, we observed that c-Abl antagonists restrained Met-triggered tumor growth in vivo by following mice injected intraperitoneally with GTL-16 cells engineered for in vivo non-invasive bioluminescence imaging (Figure 2d). Imatinib treatment led to a reduction of tumor weight by 49%, and of nodule number by 64% (size<2mm) and 61% (size>2mm) (Figures 2e and f). Taken together, these findings provide the first in vivo demonstration that c-Abl, when aberrantly instructed by oncogenic RTKs such as Met, is required for solid tumor growth. c-Abl interconnects RTK and p53 core pathways by regulating Mdm2 gene expression. The observed major effect of c-Abl inhibition on Met-dependent cancer cells led us to hypothesize that c-Abl might act as molecular relay connecting core pathways. One of the most frequently altered core pathway evidenced by cancer genomic studies is centered on the tumor suppressor p53. We therefore asked whether c-Abl inhibition would affect the p53 core pathway by monitoring, as a readout of p53 transcriptional activity, expression of target genes such as Mdm2, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 WAF1, or Noxa. 26, 27 For this purpose, HepG2 cells (expressing the transcriptionally competent wild-type p53) were transfected with the luciferase reporter gene controlled by Mdm2, p21 WAF1, or Noxa promoters, which are involved in cell survival, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis, respectively. Luciferase activity was measured in cells either treated with HGF or co-transfected with Abl PP active form. 28 We found that both HGF treatment and Abl PP expression selectively enhanced luciferase activity controlled by Mdm2, but not by p21 WAF1 or Noxa promoters (Figure 3a; Supplementary Figure S2a). The selectivity of Met-Abl axis to upregulate Mdm2, but not p21 or Noxa, was further confirmed by western blot studies (Supplementary Figure S2b). Importantly, the activity of the Mdm2-luciferase reporter was impaired in the presence of both c-Abl and p53 inhibitors (Figure 3a). Mdm2 overexpression is frequently observed in several tumors and contributes to tumorigenesis through p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. 29, 30 Through a series of experimental settings, we evaluated Mdm2 regulation by the Met-Abl-p53 axis. Pharmacological impairment or shRNA interference of either c-Abl or p53 prevented Mdm2 upregulation in HepG2 cells exposed to HGF stimulation (Figures 3b?e; Supplementary Figure S2c). Conversely, the Abl PP constitutively active form led to an increase of Mdm2 levels even in the absence of HGF stimulation (Figure 3e). Moreover, HGF or Abl-PP failed to induce Mdm2 upregulation in p53-deficient Hep3B cells (Figures 3f and g). We found also high Mdm2 levels in GTL-16 cells (expressing the transcriptionally competent wild-type p53), which were drastically reduced when either c-Abl or p53 was impaired (Figures 4a and b; Supplementary Figures S2d and e). We next ascertained the relative contribution of Mdm2 regulation by c-Abl downstream of oncogenic Met by assessing the sensitivity of Mdm2 overexpressing GTL-16 cells (GTL-16 overMdm2) to c-Abl antagonists. Mdm2 levels were drastically reduced by c-Abl inhibitors in control cells, but not in GTL-16 overMdm2 cells (Figure 4c). When cells were exposed to c-Abl inhibitors, we observed an \u00a1\u00ad30% higher survival and tumorigenesis capacity of GTL-16 overMdm2 compared with controls (Figures 4d and e). In contrast, no changes were observed in the absence of c-Abl inhibitors (Figures 4d and e), indicating that the enhanced survival and tumorigenic properties correlated with c-Abl signaling. The enhanced survival properties were accompanied by impaired caspase activation in GTL-16 overMdm2 cells exposed to c-Abl antagonists compared with controls (Supplementary Figure S3a and b). Altogether, these findings show that c-Abl signaling interconnects the Met-RTK to p53, leading to Mdm2 upregulation and survival of cancer cells. c-Abl regulates p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392, ensuring a qualitative readout of p53 transcriptional outcomes. We next investigated how c-Abl acted on p53 to regulate Mdm2 transcription in cells exposed to survival stimuli such as those emanating from Met. As p53 functions are highly modulated by post-translational modifications, 26, 31 we evaluated whether c-Abl inhibition would affect p53 phosphorylation. Basal low levels of p53 phosphorylation on Ser 15 and Ser 46 residues in the N-terminal region, which are usually phosphorylated in response to stress stimuli, were found in GTL-16 cells. No significant changes were observed in the presence of c-Abl antagonists (Supplementary Figure S4a). In contrast, high levels of p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392 were found in GTL-16 cells, which were impaired by c-Abl antagonists (Figure 5a; Supplementary Figure S4a). Consistently, c-Abl-dependent p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392 was also found in HepG2 cells exposed to HGF (Figure 5b). It has been shown that phosphorylation on Ser 392 leads to a p53 conformational change that enhances DNA binding and transcriptional activity. 31 We therefore ascertained whether p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392 was required for Met-Abl-triggered Mdm2 transcriptional regulation by reconstituting either p53 wt or p53 S392A mutant in p53-deficient Hep3B cells. By following luciferase activity, we found that p53 S392A failed to trigger Mdm2-promoter induction in response to HGF, in contrast to p53 wt (Figure 5c; Supplementary Figure S4b). Enhanced luciferase activity by HGF in Hep3B cells transfected with p53 wt was blocked in the presence of c-Abl antagonists (Figure 5c). Furthermore, HGF induced p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392 and upregulation of endogenous Mdm2 levels in Hep3B cells transfected with p53 wt, but not with p53 S392A (Figure 5d), thus demonstrating the requirement of p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392 for Mdm2 transcriptional regulation by the Met-Abl axis. We next assayed whether p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392 enhances its DNA binding by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation studies in Hep3B cells transfected either with p53 wt or p53 S392A. We found higher basal levels of Mdm2 promoter bound to p53 wt compared with the p53 S392A mutant (Figure 5e). Moreover, HGF increased the levels of Mdm2 promoter bound to p53 wt, but not to p53 S392A (Figure 5e). Altogether, these findings indicate that c-Abl signaling by the Met-RTK regulates distinct p53 transcriptional outcomes through its phosphorylation on Ser 392. p38-MAPK links Met-Abl to p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392 and Mdm2 upregulation. We next investigated how c-Abl tyrosine kinase triggered p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392. It has been reported that p38-MAPKs may regulate the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser 392 in nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis and in cells exposed to UV treatment. 26, 31 We previously reported that HGF stimulation leads to transient p38-MAPK phosphorylation in embryonic cells. 32 We therefore analyzed whether p38-MAPK signaling was required downstream of Met-Abl for p53 phosphorylation and Mdm2 expression. We found that phosphorylation of p38-MAPK was dependent on activated Met and c-Abl in GTL-16 cells (Figure 6a). Inhibition of p38-MAPK interfered with p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392 and Mdm2 levels in GTL-16 cells (Figures 6a and b). Moreover, c-Abl shRNA interference significantly reduced levels of Mdm2, p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392, and p38 phosphorylation (Figures 6c and d). Finally, low levels of Mdm2 and p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392, but not of p38 phosphorylation, were observed in GTL-16 transfected with p53 shRNA interference (Figure 6d), indicating that p53 phosphorylation is epistatic to p38 function. The requirement of p38-MAPK downstream of activated c-Abl was further conformed through a series of experimental setting in HepG2 (Supplementary Figures S5a?c). Altogether, these findings show that p38-MAPK signaling links Met-Abl activation to phospho-Ser 392-p53 and Mdm2 upregulation. Clinical correlation of phospho-Met, wild-type phospho-Ser 392-p53, and Mdm2 levels. The identification of a novel mechanism by which oncogenic Met regulates Mdm2 through Abl-p53 led us to determine whether there was a clinical correlation between oncogenic Met, phospho-Ser 392-p53, and Mdm2 levels in human tumors. We examined a total of 69 patient samples by applying a tumor array screening of human HCCs, where it has been reported that Met contributes to oncogenesis. 16, 33 We found that 35 samples (\u00a1\u00ad50%) were positive for phospho-Met staining and 24 samples (\u00a1\u00ad35%) for nuclear phospho-Ser 392-p53 staining. Notably, 20/69 HCCs (\u00a1\u00ad29%) showed coincidental immunoreactivity for both antigens. We next evaluated the p53 status in 20 double phospho-Met and phospho-Ser 392-p53 positive tumors, and found that p53 gene was mutated in only 6 HCCs (3 in exon 5, 3 in exon 7). Thus, 20/24 tumors positive for phospho-Ser 392-p53 were also positive for phospho-Met, indicating that p53 phosphorylation was preferentially associated with the Met oncogenic state (Figure 7a; Supplementary Table 1). We next evaluated Mdm2 levels in double phospho-Met/phospho-Ser 392-p53 positive HCCs by performing Q-RT-PCR and found a significant Mdm2 upregulation compared with controls (Figure 7b; Supplementary Table 1). Double-positive cases were not associated with other clinical-pathological parameters (age, sex, etiology) nor with Mdm2 gene amplification, evaluated by FISH assay. A similar correlation between phospho-Met and wild-type phospho-Ser 392-p53 was also observed in 6/10 non-small-cell lung cancers. Thus, oncogenic Met and wild-type p53 phosphorylation on Ser 392 together with elevated Mdm2 levels in HCCs strongly supports a role for Met-Abl-p53-Mdm2 path in subpopulations of human cancers. Discussion. In this work, we showed that inhibition of c-Abl interferes with the Met-driven oncogenic program in vivo. Activated c-Abl signals through p38-MAPK to phosphorylate p53 on Ser 392 in cancer cells with an oncogenic Met. As a result, we observed a differential transcriptional modulation of p53 target genes, leading to the selective upregulation of the Mdm2 survival gene (Figure 8). Notably, Mdm2 overexpression decreased the sensitivity of cancer cells to c-Abl antagonists. Our findings unveil the existence of a previously unrecognized mechanism by which RTKs modulate cell survival through c-Abl. Aberrant activation of RTKs such as Met and ErbBs is associated with the evolution of several solid tumors, and their inhibition is deeply explored for molecular therapies. 4, 20, 21, 22 However, this strategy may not be fully effective since cells exposed to an inhibitor of the \u00a1\u00aeprimary' activated kinase soon become resistant by a mechanism described as RTK switching. 4, 20, 21, 22 Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence that inhibition of c-Abl hampers the oncogenic program triggered by the activation of RTKs such as Met. The findings also suggest an alternative strategy to counteract oncogene dependency by targeting downstream signaling nodes, such as c-Abl, shared by several RTKs, 8, 9, 10, 11 which may therefore overcome resistance associated to RTK switching. Notably, protein-network-based strategies have revealed that some proteins, although not mutated, have important roles in interconnecting key signals in oncogenic processes. 34 Even though c-Abl genetic alterations are rarely found in solid tumors, 11 the identification of c-Abl as a mandatory passage in RTK-triggered oncogenesis designates it as a promising therapeutic target. p53 transcriptional regulation depends on multiple factors such as the strength and reversibility of the stress, and the cellular context. 26, 27, 35 The p53 tumor suppressor function can be converted into tumor promoting by a few mutations found in tumors. 31, 35 Recent studies have shown that, rather than being a simple tumor suppressor gene, p53 is integrated in instructive signals to orchestrate developmental cell fate. 36, 37 Interestingly, it has been shown that while p53 acetylation is required for its transactivation activity on several p53 target genes, the Mdm2 promoter is regulated by p53 even in the absence of this post-translational regulation, suggesting that Mdm2 transcription by p53 may involve specific pathways. 38 We identified Ser 392 phosphorylation as a mechanism to specifically tune the expression of genes like Mdm2 and regulate cell survival. In contrast, Met does not modulate the phosphorylation of other Ser residues regulating p53 levels, which would be incompatible with tumorigenesis. Notably, in the cancer cell systems we have used, the increase Mdm2 levels do not impact significantly the basal levels of p53, which are, and remain, low compared with those found in cells exposed to agents triggering apoptosis, such as adriamycin. It has been shown that Abl activation may also trigger Mdm2 phosphorylation, which in turn impairs the inhibition of p53 by Mdm2. 39 Thus, c-Abl appears to modulate Mdm2 at multiple levels, and the signaling outcomes appear to be distinct from the well-known feedback loop on p53 regulation. Interestingly, our findings raise the provocative idea that oncogenic RTKs instruct wild-type p53 to participate in tumor evolution. Our results agree with those of recent studies aimed at uncovering the molecular mechanisms through which wild-type p53 activity is tuned in tumorigenesis. 40 Future work will clarify to which extent Ser 392 phosphorylation confers selectivity towards specific DNA sequences (and consequently target genes), which mechanisms are triggered by Mdm2 to impair cell death, and whether other signaling components are recruited within this path at different levels. Although high levels of phospho-Ser 392-p53 have been observed in tumors with mutant p53 and have been correlated with malignancy, 31 this phosphorylation in human tumors with wild-type p53 has been neglected so far. Our HCC array studies revealed that p53 was wild type in 70% of double-positive phospho-Met/phospho-Ser 392-p53, pointing to the path we have identified as a novel putative mechanism to modulate wild-type p53 function in cancer. These studies deserve further investigation to uncover the relationship between phospho-Ser 392-p53 and deregulated RTK in solid tumors, and to clarify whether this correlation can be used as a signaling signature to identify those tumors that may be sensitive to c-Abl antagonists. In summary, we introduce c-Abl as a signaling node interconnecting RTK and p53 core pathways, and provide clinical correlations between oncogenic Met, wild-type phospho-Ser 392-p53, and Mdm2 levels in human tumors. Our findings point to c-Abl as a novel Achille's heel in RTK-dependent tumors with wild-type p53. Abl antagonists, while highly effective in some leukemias, have met little success when tested in patients affected by solid tumors. This failure, however, may be related to the molecular heterogeneity of the treated tumors. Here, we have identified a molecular signature that may help to discriminate which tumors could be sensitive to c-Abl inhibitors. Thus, the promise of c-Abl antagonists for combined treatment of solid tumors, either with traditional or with RTK-targeted agents, should deserve further evaluation according to tumor signaling signature.

GTL-16, HepG2 cells with wild-type p53, 42 and p53-deficient Hep3B cells 43 were grown in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with penicillin?streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum. GTL-16 luc, GTL-16 overMdm2, and GTL-16 shp53 cells were obtained by stable transfection of parental GTL-16 cells with the corresponding constructs, using lipofectamin reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones were selected using geneticin (for GTL-16 luc and GTL-16 overMdm2; 0.5mg/ml, Invitrogen) and puromycin (for GTL-16 shp53; 2\u00a5\u00ecg/ml, Invitrogen). Expression of luciferase in resistant clones was confirmed by assaying luciferase activity in cell lysates.

For GTL-16 luc, a pool of six positive clones was confirmed to behave like the parental cells in soft agar growth assays and was subsequently used for in vivo studies. For GTL-16 overMdm2 and GTL-16 shp53, pools of resistant clones were used for biochemical and biological assays. Biochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR. For biochemical studies, cell extracts, immunoprecipitations, and western blots were performed as described previously. 14, 15, 44 For quantitative real-time PCR, total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript Reverse Transciptase II (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Levels of Mdm2 mRNA were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), based on TaqMan methodology, using the ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), as previously described. 45 Briefly, custom-designed TaqMan primers and probes (Applied Biosystems) specific for Mdm2 were used.

For survival assays, GTL-16 cells were seeded in serum-free medium; inhibitors were applied 24h later. HepG2 cells were seeded in medium containing 10% serum, starved for 24h, and then inhibitors were applied. Viability was assessed with the Cell Titer Glo Luminescent Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Survival assays and anchorage-independent growth assays were performed as previously described. 14, 15, 18 Data on biological assays are representative of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. In vivo tumorigenesis assays. Mice were kept at the IBDML animal facilities and all experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. Xenografts of GTL-16 luc cells were established by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of cells (10 6) in nude mice (S/SOPF SWISS NU/NU; Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Mice were then treated daily with Imatinib (i.p. 50mg/kg, according to the guidelines provided by Novartis Pharma AG) or vehicle. For in vivo bioluminescence imaging, after i.p. injection of luciferin (3mg/mouse), mice were anesthetized and placed in the NightOwl LB981 (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany) under continuous anesthetization (1.5?3% isoflurane in O 2). First, a black and white photographic image was acquired using 100ms exposure. Next, the luminescent image was acquired using a 2-min photon integration period with background subtraction (pixel binning 8 \u00a1\u00bf 8). Analysis was performed using Berthold Technologies software. Mice were then killed after 20 days of treatment. Tumor nodules present in the peritoneal cavity were isolated and quantified according to their diameter and their total weight. Three independent tumorigenesis assays were performed (eight mice per group were used). For tumorigenesis assays with HepG2 pSuper and HepG2 shAbl cells, nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously into the flank/leg region with control pSuper or shAbl mutant cells. Tumor size was externally monitored every 3 days. ChIP studies. Formaldehyde cross-linking and ChIP were performed as described previously. 46 p53-null Hep3B cells (0.5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 8?1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 8) were transfected with 3\u00a5\u00ecg of p53 wt or p53 S392A expression vector, or with an empty vector pCDNA3 using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were treated 24h after transfection with or without HGF (50ng/ml) for 20min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 10min with 1% formaldehyde. After the reaction was quenched with 0.1M glycine, the cells were sonicated into chromatin fragments with an average length of 500?800bp. Immunoprecipitation was performed with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Uppsala, Sweden) and 3?5\u00a5\u00ecg of anti-p53 antibody (Ab7; Oncogene Science). The chromatin solution was precleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose for 2h at 4\u00a1\u00c6C, divided into aliquots, and incubated with the antibodies overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. Before use, protein G-Sepharose was blocked twice at 4\u00a1\u00c6C with salmon sperm DNA (1\u00a5\u00ecg/\u00a5\u00ecl) that had been sheared to a 500-bp length and BSA (1\u00a5\u00ecg/\u00a5\u00ecl) for 2h and overnight, respectively. Cross-linking was reversed by incubation of the eluate for 12h at 65\u00a1\u00c6C with 200mM NaCl. Finally, samples were treated with proteinase K (Invitrogen) and DNA was purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol plus glycogen. The resulting DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR using following primers. Mdm2 promoter Forward: 5\u00a1\u00c7-GCAGGTTGACTCAGCTTTTCCTCT-3\u00a1\u00c7 Mdm2 promoter Reverse: 5\u00a1\u00c7-GTGGTTACAGCCCCATCAGTAGGTA-3\u00a1\u00c7. p53 mutations analysis. Only p-p53 nuclear immunoreactive cases were analyzed for p53 exons 5?8 mutations using SSCP analysis (single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis). Briefly, PCR amplification of exons 5, 6, 7, and 8 were done in 50\u00a5\u00ecl reaction volumes with a final concentration of 0.2mmol/l deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Finnzymes), 0.2\u00a5\u00ecmol/l of each primer (Sigma), and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Finnzymes). PCR products, denaturated in a buffer containing 100% formamide (Sigma), were run at room temperature on 15% acrylamide-bisacrylamide gel (Sigma) for 1h at 100V, and 4h at 300V. DNA containing the wild-type p53 (human placental DNA) was always included as negative control. Silver staining was done using PlusOne DNA Silver Staining kit (Amersham Biosciences Corp.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tumor series under study and Immunohistochemistry. Sixty-nine cases of HCC resected at the Istituto Clinico Humanitas from 2004 to 2006 were analyzed. Clinicopathologial features are reported in Supplementary Table 1. From the paraffin tissue of the single most representative tumor sample, four punches were obtained and collected on a tissue microarray (TMA). Standard 2\u00a5\u00ecm-thick sections of TMA were submitted to antigen retrieval (30min at 98\u00a1\u00c6C in W-CAP TEC Buffer pH 8, Bio-Optica, Milano, Italy) and then incubated (1h) with mouse monoclonal p-p53 (1:100; Novocastra Laboratories, New Castle upon Tyne, UK) or rabbit polyclonal p-Met (Tyr1230-1234-1235; 1:50; Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The Immpress reagent was used as detection system (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Staining was obtained using 3,3\u00a1\u00c7diaminobenzidine as chromogen followed by hematoxylin counterstaining. Positive (colorectal cancer) and negative (primary antibody omitted) controls were used. The nuclear p-p53 and the cytoplasmic p-Met immunoreactivity were evaluated as follows: negative ? no or very weak/equivocal staining; positive ? unequivocal staining. Total RNA purification from paraffin-embedded HCC samples was performed using Absolutely RNA FFPE Kit (Stratagene). Levels of Mdm2 RNA were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Statistical analysis. Quantification of tumor growth in mice was analyzed by Student's t-tests. The relationship between Mdm2 mRNA levels and double-positive sample for phospho-Met and phospho-S 392-p53 was analyzed by a two-tailed Student's t-test. A P<0.05 was considered as significant. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Analyse-it software for Microsoft Excel (Analyse-it Software, Ltd, Leeds, UK, version 1.62). Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Establishment and Characterization of a New Cell Line, A99, from a Primary Small Cell Carcinoma of the Pancreas\tObjectives. Small cell carcinoma (SCC) of the pancreas is a rare malignancy with a poor prognosis. We established and characterized a primary human pancreatic SCC cell line, designated A99. Methods. Cancer tissue was obtained from the liver metastasis of a SCC of the pancreas and xenografted into nude mice. The first-pass xenograft was then used to establish a cultured cell line called A99. Cellular morphology, immunohistochemical properties, tumorigenic potential, and genetic alterations of this new line were characterized. Results. A99 cells grew consistently in culture, formed colonies in soft agar and grew as subcutaneous xenografts when inoculated into nude mice. A99 cells were positive for pancytokeratin, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, NSE, CD57 (Leu7), CD56, PGP 9.5, TTF-1, Smad4, p53 and p16 but not for CD99, PDX-1 or RB protein. Sequencing analysis revealed homozygous point mutations of KRAS and TP53. Cytogenetic analysis revealed complex chromosomal rearrangements including marker chromosomes. Conclusions. A99 is the first cell line report to be derived from a primary SCC of the pancreas. The establishment of this cell line may serve as a useful model system for studying the cell biology of this rare cancer, or for evaluation of novel targeted agents in preclinical models. Introduction. Primary small cell carcinoma (SCC) of the pancreas is an extremely rare malignancy. SCC of the pancreas is histologically defined by the presence of a diffuse, infiltrative growth pattern, small to medium-sized cells with minimal cytoplasm, fusiform nuclei with finely granular chromatin pattern, and neuroendocrine differentiation. They are also notable for a high proliferative rate (more than 10 mitoses per 10 high-power fields or Ki-67 labeling index >20%) and abundant necrosis, similar to small cell carcinomas of the lung. The overall survival of patients with SCC of the pancreas varies between 2 and 5 months as most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease 1,2. The origin of SCC of the pancreas is also a subject of debate. While some have proposed that the precursor to primary SCC of the pancreas may be an adenocarcinoma, others suggest that SCC is a variant of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (islet cell tumors) or that epithelial stem cells might be the origin 3. A standard treatment for unresectable SCC of the pancreas has not been established 4. Immortalized cell lines are powerful tools for clarifying the biological characteristics of a cancer and for developing effective treatment strategies. A variety of cell lines derived from well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (\u00a1\u00b0carcinoid tumors\u00a1\u00b1) have been established and characterized 5,6, however, no cell lines of primary SCC of the pancreas have been previously reported. We now report the establishment of a new cell line, A99, derived from a primary SCC of the pancreas and describe its characteristics with respect to sequencing, cytogenetic and immunohistochemical features. Materials and Methods. Patient History. A 60-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a chief complaint of abdominal and back pain. There was no history of smoking or excess alcohol consumption. Her family history was unremarkable. She had no relevant previous medical or surgical history. On admission, physical examination revealed jaundice. Radiographic examination showed a mass, measuring 3.0 cm in diameter, within the head of the pancreas. The computed tomographic imaging of the chest and abdomen did not show any evidence of extra-pancreatic disease. The patient underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Examination of the surgical specimen showed a 3.0 cm sized mass, invading the duodenal wall and common bile duct. On light microscopy, the neoplasm was composed entirely of small to medium-sized cells possessing scant cytoplasm and oval nuclei with a finely granular chromatin pattern (Figure 1a). The neoplasm showed extensive necrosis and a high frequency of mitotic figures (Figure 1a). Metastasis was identified in 10 of 23 sampled lymph nodes. Venous/lymphatic vessel and perineural invasion was also present. Complete review of all histologic sections did not reveal evidence of a component of ductal adenocarcinoma. Scattered pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia-1 (PanIN-1) and 2 lesions were present in the background pancreas. The surgical resection margins were negative for neoplastic cells. The final pathological diagnosis was SCC of the pancreas with lymph node metastases. Six weeks after surgical resection, the patient received chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin (60 mg/m 2) given intravenously on day 1 and etoposide (120 mg/m 2) intravenously on days 1?3, repeated every 3 weeks for three cycles. Three months after initial chemotherapy, a computed tomographic scan showed multiple liver metastases. The chemotherapy regimen was switched to obatoclax mesylate (GX15-070MS, 12.5 mg/m 2), a Bcl-2 antagonist, given intravenously on days 1 and 3 in combination with topotecan (1.25 mg/m 2) intravenously on days 1?5 but this second-line chemotherapy was ceased during the first cycle due to neutropenia. The patient\u00a1\u00afs clinical course continued to deteriorate and she expired 13 months from the time of her surgery. Prior to death, she consented to an autopsy for research purposes. At autopsy, multiple liver metastases, pleural studding of the lungs and peritoneum, and local recurrence were grossly identified. The local recurrence and multiple metastases were sampled and tumor tissues sliced into 1.0 \u00a1\u00bf 1.0 \u00a1\u00bf 0.2 cm sections for overnight fixation in 10% buffered-formalin and for snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Histological examination confirmed the gross impression of recurrent SCC. Autopsy Specimen Collection and Maintenance of Xenografts and Tumor Cell Line. One liver metastasis was obtained in sterile fashion, and 2 to 3 mm 3 samples were placed into sterile RPMI media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for transport to the animal facility for xenografting into athymic nude mice that were maintained in a laminar-flow hood under pathogen-free conditions. Xenografting was performed as described by Hahn et al 7. Tumor tissues were minced with a sterile blade into 1 mm 3 pieces in Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA), and were implanted beneath the skin fold of the back bilaterally while the mice were under isoflourane inhalation anesthesia. The animals were followed weekly for growth of xenografts. Cell Culture. When the xenografts reached ~10 mm in size, the tumors were excised and a portion of each was placed in 10% formalin for paraffin embedding or snap frozen in preparation for subsequent genetic analyses. A final portion was placed in DMEM medium with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), minced with sterile blades and digested with collagenase, type IV (Invitrogen), and hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 minutes. The digested cells were centrifuged 10 minutes at 1,000 rpm and resuspended into DMEM culture media supplemented with 20% FBS, penicillin 100 U/mL, streptomycin 100 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL, gentamicin 50 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL and amphotericin B 2.5 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 and 95% air. The supernatant with solid remnants was removed 24 hours later and replaced with fresh medium. Cells were passaged at 50% to 100% confluence and medium was exchanged every 2 days. Cell cultures were routinely monitored for mycoplasma contamination, and no mycoplasma growth has been detected. Colony Formation in Soft Agar. Six-well plates were filled with semisolid medium containing DMEM, 1% Bacto agar and 20% FBS and 50,000 cells in a semisolid medium (DMEM with 1% Bacto agar and 10% FBS) were added per well. Additional medium (DMEM with 20% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin and amphotericin B) was added to the wells to keep the agar moist, and 2.5 mL of fresh medium were added to each well every 3 days thereafter. After incubation for 21 days at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, to assess colony formation, the medium was removed, and 3 mL of 0.005% Crystal Violet (Sigma-Aldrich) staining solution was added to each well. After incubation at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 3 hours, removal of the staining solution and washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), colonies were visualized by trans-UV illumination and counted using the analysis software Quantity One (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Tumorigenicity in Nude Mice. A99 cells at passage 15 were grown to 80% confluence and trypsinized, and >90% cell viability was confirmed by trypan blue exclusion. Three 5-weeks-age athymic nude mice were subcutaneously(s.c.) inoculated into the back bilaterally. 0.5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 7 or 1.7 \u00a1\u00bf 10 7 of A99 cells of two different passages in 200 \u00a5\u00ecL of PBS were used for each injection. The mice were observed weekly for the development of xenografts. At 8 weeks after injection, the s.c. xenografted tumors reached a diameter of 13?22 mm. The mice were sacrificed and the s.c. tumors formed from A99 cells were excised and a portion of each was placed in 10% formalin for paraffin embedding or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immunohistochemistry. The tissue samples of the patient\u00a1\u00afs original tumor specimen, first passage xenografts and the s.c. tumor formed from A99 cells were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Paraffin blocks were cut into sections 4 \u00a5\u00ecm thick for the immunolabeling by the avidin-biotin complex method, with all labeling processes, from deparaffinization to counterstaining with hematoxylin, being performed automatically with the Ventana Discovery staining system (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). Antibodies used for immunohistochemical labeling are summarized in Table 1. DNA Extraction and Sequencing for KRAS, p16 and TP53. Genomic DNA was extracted from A99, its corresponding xenograft and the original metastatic tissue from which it was derived at autopsy using standard phenol-chlorophorm-isoamyl alcohol method or DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) of KRAS exons 1 and 2, p16 exons 1 and 2 and TP53 exons 5 to 9 were performed as described 8. PCR products were sequenced by use of a universal M13F primer that was incorporated into the forward primer of each primer pair (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA). Sequence data were analyzed with Sequencher 4.10.1 software (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Chromosome Analysis. The cell culture was harvested with exposure to 10 ng/mL Colcemid for 4 hours, incubated in cancer hypotonic solution at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 minutes, and fixed in 3:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid. Trypsin-Leishman staining procedure was used for G-band karyotyping. Chromosomal abnormalities were described using ISCN 2009 nomenclature 9. Results. Cell Morphology of the Cell Line. Neoplastic tissue was obtained from the liver metastasis of the SCC of the pancreas and xenografted into nude mice. This xenograft was used to create cell line A99. A99 grew constantly and formed tubular clusters but occasionally grape-like cell aggregates noted under phase contrast microscopy (Figure 2). The cultured cells were composed of small cells with granular cytoplasm and round-oval nuclei with finely stippled chromatin. A99 cells maintained their growth when cultured on poly-L-lysine-coated plastic flasks but not on uncoated plastic tissue culture flasks. Typically, aggregates of the small cells loosely adhered to the poly-L-lysine-coated plastic flasks and some cells detached before reaching confluence. Overall, these features were maintained in this cell line at 80 passages and are now considered stable. Colony Formation in Soft Agar. A99 cells were plated in soft agar at 50,000 per well in three wells in a six-well plate. They formed 173, 157 and 139 colonies per well on a six-well plate at 21 days after having been plated in soft agar (Figure 3). Tumorigenicity In Vivo. Subcutaneous injections of up to 1.7 \u00a1\u00bf 10 7 viable cells of two different passages into three nude mice have resulted in tumor development in all mice. After 8 weeks, tumors reached a diameter of 13?22 mm and grew as discrete encapsulated masses, without evidence of local invasion or distant metastasis. Tumors were harvested and assessed histologically. In all cases, the harvested xenografts were identical histologically to the patient\u00a1\u00afs original resected SCC (Figure 1). Necrosis was abundant and mitotic figures were highly frequent. Immunohistochemistry. Table 2 summarizes the immunohistochemical findings for this tumor. The neoplastic cells labeled with antibodies to pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3), synaptophysin, chromogranin A (Figure 4a), NSE, CD57 (Leu7), CD56, PGP 9.5, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), Smad4, p53 and p16, but not with antibodies to CD99, PDX-1 and retinoblastoma (RB) protein (Figure 4b). The Ki-67 labeling index was 59.7% (2124/3556). The immunohistochemical labeling patterns of all proteins were identical in the patient\u00a1\u00afs original carcinoma, first passage xenografts, A99 cells or the s.c. tumor formed from A99 cells. Sequencing Analysis of KRAS, p16 and TP53 Genes. Homozygous dinucleotide point mutations of KRAS were identified at codon 12 (Glycine to Leucine, GGT to CTT). A homozygous TP53 mutation was present at codon 127 (Serine to Threonine, TCC to ACC). No p16 mutations were found. There were no differences in these mutational signatures of samples between frozen tissues from patient\u00a1\u00afs original tumor, first passage xenografts and the cultured cell line (Figure 5). Chromosome Studies. Chromosomal analysis of A99 cells in G-banding showed the following clonal abnormalities in the 20/20 well-spread metaphases examined (Figure 6): 57~68<3n>, X,-X,der(X;2)(q10;p10),t(2;5)(q21;q13),der(5)t(2;5)del(5)(q11.2q13),+7,i(8)(q10)x2, der(9)t(1;9)(q25;p13)ins(9;?)(p13;?)dup(?),?10,i(10)(q10), ?12,?14,?15,?17,der(17)t(8;17)(q12;p11.2),?19,?22,+3~5mar[20]. Discussion. While 96% of SCCs are of pulmonary origin, about 4% arise in extrapulmonary sites. The most common sites of origin are the gastrointestinal system, larynx, pharynx and paranasal sinuses, uterus, cervix and prostate 10,11,12. SCC arising in the pancreas is an extremely rare entity. A Medline search of the literature indicated only 40 cases were reported from 1973 through 2009. Consistent with our patient, SCC of the pancreas is likely to occur in the head of pancreas in patients with average age of 60 years and common clinical manifestations are abdominal pain, weight loss and jaundice 2. The identification, development, and testing of therapeutic agents for SCC of the pancreas have been hampered by the lack of available models. For these reasons, the establishment of a cell line of SCC of the pancreas that could help to understand the histogenesis and lead to appropriate treatment has been eagerly anticipated. A human pancreatic carcinoid cell line, BON, has been widely used to study pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, but carcinoid tumors are both clinically and genotypically distinct from SCC of the pancreas 5. The A99 cell line grows continuously in cell culture, forms colonies in soft agar, forms solid tumors when injected s.c. into nude mice, and expresses numerous neuroendocrine markers. This line also retains the characteristics of the patient\u00a1\u00afs original carcinoma by morphologic examination, immunohistochemical studies and sequencing analysis. The ability of this cell line to reliably form tumors in vivo may thus enable preclinical studies to test antineoplastic agents on SCCs of the pancreas. Molecular analyses of A99 indicate it is genetically complex. In karyotype analysis, both numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities were identified. These changes are similar to the patterns of chromosomal aberrations reported for high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas including small cell cancers of the lung, which have recurrent numerical whole-chromosome losses, frequently involving chromosomes 4, 10, 15 and 22 and structural aberrations including deletions of chromosomes 1p, 3p, 5q, 10q, and 17p 13. Sanger sequencing of the carcinoma and cell line revealed an activating mutation of KRAS and an inactivating mutation of TP53. The KRAS mutation found is a rare dinucleotide (\u00a1\u00b0tandem\u00a1\u00b1) mutation in codon 12 that is nonetheless predicted to have oncogenic function 14. Of interest, while p16 expression was intact there was a complete loss of RB protein by immunohistochemistry. Loss of RB protein is rare in both pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine neoplasms 15,16 whereas it is frequently observed in small cell carcinomas of the lung and in SCCs in extrapulmonary sites 17,18. In human and mouse models of small cell lung carcinoma, loss of p53 and RB activities are a necessary step of the genetic progression and aberrations of RB1 gene play an important role in the carcinogenesis in terms of neuroendocrine features 19,20,21. In conclusion, we have developed a SCC cell line capable of being propagated in tissue culture and in nude mice. Prospective randomized trials of therapy for SCC of the pancreas are unlikely in the future because of the rarity of the disease. This cell line, A99, has promise as a valuable tool for investigating the biology of SCC and for developing preclinical therapeutic models to treat this aggressive tumor type. Acknowledgments.

This strain shows tumor-specific replication and is capable of eradicating tumors with little or no virulence in mice. This study aimed to distinguish the contribution of added VACV promoter-driven transcriptional units as inserts from the effects of insertional inactivation of three viral genes, and to determine the correlation between replication efficiency of oncolytic vaccinia virus in cell cultures and the virulence and antitumor efficacy in mice Methods. A series of recombinant VACV strains was generated by replacing one, two, or all three of the expression cassettes in GLV-1h68 with short non-coding DNA sequences. The replication efficiency and tumor cell killing capacity of these newly generated VACV strains were compared with those of the parent virus GLV-1h68 in cell cultures. The virus replication efficiency in tumors and antitumor efficacy as well as the virulence were evaluated in nu/nu (nude) mice bearing human breast tumor xenografts. Results. we found that virus replication efficiency increased with removal of each of the expression cassettes. The increase in virus replication efficiency was proportionate to the strength of removed VACV promoters linked to foreign genes. The replication efficiency of the new VACV strains paralleled their cytotoxicity in cell cultures. The increased replication efficiency in tumor xenografts resulted in enhanced antitumor efficacy in nude mice. Similarly, the enhanced virus replication efficiency was indicative of increased virulence in nude mice. Conclusions. These data demonstrated that insertion of VACV promoter-driven transcriptional units into the viral genome for the purpose of insertional mutagenesis did modulate the efficiency of virus replication together with antitumor efficacy as well as virulence. Replication efficiency of oncolytic VACV in cell cultures can predict the virulence and therapeutic efficacy in nude mice. These findings may be essential for rational design of safe and potent VACV strains for vaccination and virotherapy of cancer in humans and animals. Background. At least 7 million people die from cancer worldwide every year, with an estimated 12 million deaths in 2030 [1]. In the Unites States, one in two men and one in three women will be diagnosed with cancer, and one in four Americans will die from this disease [2]. Currently, the principal cancer treatment methods are surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Although a great deal of efforts have been made to improve these conventional therapies, they are generally ineffective in treating patients with advance cancer. Thus, new treatments are urgently needed. In the last two decades, considerable progress has been achieved in the field of oncolytic virotherapy. Oncolytic viruses have emerged as promising cancer therapeutic agents. Since the first genetically engineered oncolytic virus (oncolytic adenovirus ONYX-015) entered clinical trials in 1996, many oncolytic virus constructs from at least seven different species have been tested in a variety of clinical trials. Clinical data indicates that oncolytic viruses are generally safe in cancer patients. Furthermore, virus replication within tumors and a certain degree of therapeutic efficacy have also been reported in clinical trials [3]. Oncolytic viruses destroy tumors by several mechanisms [3], including intrinsic antitumor activity, induction of host antitumor immune responses, destruction of the tumor vasculature [4], and expression of therapeutic genes. The importance of each mechanism has yet to be determined. Oncolytic virotherapy can also effectively complement conventional cancer therapies, such as chemo- and radiotherapy. Vaccinia virus (VACV) was used as a vaccine to eradicate smallpox that is estimated to have killed 500 million people in the 19 th and 20 th Centuries [5]. Thus, it is arguably the most successful live biotherapeutic agent. VACV is also the first oncolytic virus demonstrating viral oncolysis in the laboratory [6,7]. Many oncolytic VACVs have been tested in preclinical and clinical studies [8]. Owing to safety concerns, most of the oncolytic VACVs developed in recent years have been attenuated, mainly through viral gene inactivation. The following genes have been inactivated, either singly or in combination [8]: F14.5L, hemagglutinin (HA), serine protease inhibitor-1 (SPI-1), soluble type I interferon (IFN) receptor, SPI-2, thymidine kinase (TK), and vaccinia growth factor (VGF). It is noted that over-attenuation may affect antitumor efficacy. For example, a VACV triple mutant lacking SPI-1, SPI-2, and TK was reported to be greatly attenuated in mice. However, it also replicated in general less efficiently in tumor cells in culture, and its overall antitumor efficacy was lower than the parental viruses [9]. So far, the correlation between viral replication efficiency in tumor cells in culture and antitumor efficacy has not been established. We have previously reported a light-emitting oncolytic VACV, GLV-1h68, which was constructed by inserting three foreign gene expression cassettes encoding Renilla luciferase-Aequorea green fluorescent protein fusion protein (RUC-GFP), \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase, and \u00a5\u00e2-glucuronidase into the F14.5L, J2R, and A56R loci within the genome of VACV LIVP, respectively [10]. GLV-1h68 was greatly attenuated compared with its parent viruses [10,11]. Here, we report on the construction of a series of recombinant VACVs with fine-tuned replication efficiency by replacing one, two, or all three of these expression cassettes with short non-coding DNA sequences. We found that virus replication efficiency increased with removal of each of the expression cassettes. The increase in virus replication efficiency was proportionate to the strength of removed VACV promoters linked to foreign genes. Using this series of recombinant VACVs, we demonstrated that increased viral replication efficiency in cell cultures correlated with enhanced therapeutic efficacy, but also with increased virulence in nude mice with solid human tumor xenografts. Materials and methods. Virus and cell culture. The human breast ductal adenocarcinoma cell line GI-101A [12] was kindly provided by Dr. A. Aller (Rumbaugh-Goodwin Institute for Cancer Research, Inc.) and was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 ng/mL of \u00a5\u00e2-estradiol and progesterone (Sigma, St. Louis, CA), 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA), and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA). African green monkey kidney fibroblast CV-1 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37\u00a1\u00c6C under 5% CO 2. GLV-1h68 was derived from VACV LIVP (Lister strain from the Institute of Viral Preparations, Moscow, Russia), as described previously [10]. Construction of VACV shuttle vectors and generation of recombinant VACVs. The VACV J2R (TK) shuttle vector pCR-TKLR-gpt2 contains the left and right flanking sequences of VACV J2R separated by Kpn I, Sac I, and BamH I, and Escherichia coli guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (gpt) gene driven by the VACV early promoter p7.5 as a transient dominant selectable marker. The left flank of the TK locus in the LIVP genome was PCR amplified with the primers TKL-5 (5'-ATAAGCTTTGTTACAGATGGAAGGGTCAAA-3') and TKL-3 (5'-AGGTACCGTTTGCCATACGCTCACAGA-3') using Invitrogen High Fidelity PCR mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The right flanking region of the TK locus in the LIVP was PCR amplified with the primers TKR-5 (5'-TGAGCTCGGATCCTTCTGTGAGCGTATGGCAAA-3') and TKR-3 (5'-TTACTAGTACACTACGGTGGCACCATCT-3'). To construct VACV A56R (HA) shuttle vector, the left and right flanking sequences of VACV A56R were PCR-amplified from VACV LIVP using Platinum PCR SuperMix High Fidelity (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the primers: 5'-GCGCATATGACACGATTACCAATACTTTTG-3' and 5'-GTCGGGATCCTGCGAAGCTTAGATTTCGAATACCGACGAGC-3' (left flank), 5'-GAAATCTAAGCTTCGCAGGATCCCGACTCCGGAACCAATTACTG-3' and 5'-GCGGAATTCTGATAGATTTTACTATCCCAG-3' (right flank). The two fragments were joined together using the method of gene-splicing by overlapping extension [13]. The resulting fragment was digested with Nde I and EcoR I and cloned into the same-cut pUCP7.5-gpt-1 to yield pNCVVhaT. The flanking sequences of A56R in the target vector were confirmed by sequencing. The VACV F14.5L shuttle vector pNCVVf14.5lT was constructed as described previously [11]. The recombinant viruses GLV-1h70, GLV-1h71, and GLV-1h72 were generated from the parental virus GLV-1h68 using pNCVVhaT, pNCVVf14.5lT, and pCR-TKLR-gpt2, respectively. GLV-1h73 was generated from GLV-1h70 using pNCVVf14.5lT, and GLV-1h74 from GLV-1h73 using pCR-TKLR-gpt2. All recombinant viruses were constructed using the method described previously [14]. Viral growth curves. GI-101A cells grown in 6-well plates were infected with individual virus strains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 or 10. Three wells of GI-101A cells infected individually with each virus strain were harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection (hpi). Viral particles from the infected cells were released by three cycles of freeze-thaw, followed by sonicating three times for 1 min at full power using the Branson sonifier 450 before titration. Virus strains were titrated in CV-1 cells in duplicates. Cytotoxicity assays in cell culture. Cytotoxcity was performed as described previously [14]. Briefly, GI-101A cells were plated at 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 cells per well in 96-well plates and incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a CO 2 incubator overnight. Cells were either mock-infected or infected with each virus strain at an MOI of 0.01. Viral cytotoxity was assayed daily for 5 d. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was quantified using a CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Results are expressed as the percentage of surviving cells. This percentage was determined using the formula: (cell lysate-supernatant) tx/(cell lysate-supernatant) t0 \u00a1\u00bf 100. In the formula, (cell lysate-supernatant) tx and (cell lysate-supernatant) t0 represent LDH activity in the cells after and before infection, respectively. Virus virulence and tumor therapy in mice. All mice were cared for and maintained in accordance with animal welfare regulations under an approved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Explora Biolabs (San Diego Science Center, San Diego, CA). GI-101A xenograft tumors were developed in 6- to 8-week-old male nude mice (NCI:Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1 nu, Harlan) by implanting 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 GI-101A cells subcutaneously on the right hind leg. Tumor growth was recorded once a week in three dimensions using a digital caliper. Tumor volume was calculated as ([length \u00a1\u00bf width \u00a1\u00bf height]/2) and reported in mm 3. Thirty-three days after tumor cell implantation, mice were injected with a single intravenous dose of 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 plaque forming units (pfu) of individual virus strains in 100 \u00a5\u00ecL of PBS. Animals were observed daily for any sign of virulence. Fourteen days post virus injection, four animals from each group were sacrificed for analysis of virus titers in tumors as described previously [10]. Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism, version 5.03 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Comparisons of treatment groups were made by either unpaired t test or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni comparison post-tests as indicated in the figure legends. The post-test was only performed when ANOVA revealed significance. Statistical analysis of survival was assessed using the log-rank test. Values of P less than 0.05 were considered significant. Results. Generation of the derivatives of GLV-1h68 by replacing the foreign gene expression cassettes with short non-coding DNA sequences. Previously, we have shown that insertion of the foreign marker gene expression cassettes into the F14.5L, J2R (encoding thymidine kinase, TK), and A56R (encoding hemagglutinin, HA) loci of the VACV LIVP genome disrupted the open-reading frames (ORFs) F14.5L, J2R, and A56R, resulting in the recombinant VACV GLV-1h68 with enhanced tumor colonization specificity as well as reduced virulence in mice [10,11]. To determine the contributions of individual foreign gene expression to virus attenuation, in addition to viral gene inactivation, we constructed a series of the derivatives of GLV-1h68 by replacing one, two, or all three of these expression cassettes in the genome of GLV-1h68 with short non-coding DNA sequences while the original ORFs F145L, J2R, and A56R remain disrupted in all the derivatives. The RUC-GFP expression cassette at the F14.5L locus was replaced with the short DNA sequence \"GGATCCTGCGAAGCTT\" comprising BamH I and Hind III sites (underlined). The foreign inserts (human transferin receptor and lacZ) at the J2R locus were replaced with the non-coding DNA sequence \"CTGTGAGCGTATGGCAAACGGTACCGAGCTCGGATCC\" consisting of Kpn I, Sac I, and BamH I sites. The \u00a5\u00e2-glucuronidase expression cassette at the A56R locus was replaced with the short DNA sequence \"TAAGCTTCGCAGGATCCC\" comprising Hind III and BamH I sites. The genotype of each derivative shown in Figure ?Figure1A1A was verified by PCR, followed by DNA sequencing. The status of expression of GFP, \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase, and \u00a5\u00e2-glucuronidase by each derivative was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u00a5\u00e2-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal), or 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u00a5\u00e2-D-glucuronic acid (X-GlcA) staining, respectively (Figure ?(Figure1B1B). Excision of the foreign expression cassettes from GLV-1h68 enhances virus replication efficiency in cell cultures. To examine whether removal of any of the originally introduced foreign gene expression cassettes from GLV-1h68 would affect virus replication, human breast tumor GI-101A cells in culture were infected with the parental virus GLV-1h68 and its derivatives at an MOI of 0.01 or 10. The infected cells were harvested at 24, 48, and 72 hpi and the viral titers at each time point determined in CV-1 cells using standard plaque assays. At the MOI of 0.01, GLV-1h71 (RUC-GFP -), GLV-1h73 (RUC-GFP -/gusA -), and GLV-1h74 (RUC-GFP -/lacZ -/gusA -) showed significantly enhanced virus replication at all time points examined, whereas GLV-1h70 (gusA -) and GLV-1h72 (lacZ -) demonstrated significantly better virus replication at 48 and 72 hpi, but not at 24 hpi, compared with the parent virus GLV-1h68 (Figure ?(Figure2A).2A). At the MOI of 10, GLV-1h71 (RUC-GFP -), GLV-1h73 (RUC-GFP -/gusA -), and GLV-1h74 (RUC-GFP -/lacZ -/gusA -) showed significantly higher replication efficiency at 48h, 72h, and all time points, respectively, than GLV-1h68 (Figure ?(Figure2A).2A). The difference in virus replication among all the viruses was more prominent at the low MOI (0.01) than that at the high MOI (10). Furthermore, GLV-1h71 (RUC-GFP -), GLV-1h73 (RUC-GFP -/gusA -), and GLV-1h74 (RUC-GFP -/lacZ -/gusA -) formed significantly larger plaques than GLV-1h68 in GI-101A cells (Figure ?(Figure2B).2B). The plaques formed by GLV-1h70 (gusA -) and GLV-1h72 (lacZ -) were consistently slightly larger than that formed by GLV-1h68. However, the differences in plaque size among GLV-1h68, GLV-1h70 (gusA -), and GLV-1h72 (lacZ -) were not statistically significant. Taken together, removal of any of the foreign expression cassettes or in combination, enhanced virus replication in each cell lines, irrespective of which foreign gene was removed. Among three foreign expression cassettes within the genome of GLV-1h68, removal of the RUC-GFP expression cassette had the greatest enhanced effect on virus replication. GLV-1h73 (RUC-GFP -/gusA -) with two of the foreign gene expression cassettes removed, replicated more rapidly than any of the single foreign gene expression cassette removal viruses, whereas GLV-1h74 (RUC-GFP -/lacZ -/gusA -) in which all three foreign expression cassettes were replaced, demonstrated the highest replication efficiency among all the virus strains tested. Thus, a series of recombinant VACV strains with fine-tuned replication efficiency were generated by replacing one, two, or three expression cassettes in the genome of GLV-1h68 with short non-coding DNA sequences. Replication efficiency of GLV-1h68 and its derivatives in cell cultures inversely correlates with added strength of the inserted promoters remaining in each viral genome. As demonstrated above, replication efficiency of GLV-1h68 and its derivatives in cell cultures was inversely proportionate with the number of foreign gene expression cassettes present in the viral genome. Among the single foreign gene expression cassette removal derivatives, GLV-1h71 (RUC-GFP -) showed the highest replication efficiency. It is interesting to note that the RUC-GFP expression cassette that was replaced in GLV-1h71 contains a synthetic early/late promoter (PE/L), the strongest promoter among the promoters introduced into the genome of GLV-1h68 [15]. It is likely that the extra transcriptional and translational burden imposed by over-expression of the foreign gene expression cassettes might slow down virus replication. Since an extra transcriptional and translational burden is directly related to the strength of a promoter, we sought to analyze the relationship between the replication efficiency of the GLV-1h68 derivatives and the strength of the inserted promoters remaining in each viral genome. Firstly, we assigned an index to each promoter according to their strength as reported before [15]. The index of the VACV P7.5 K promoter (P7.5) was set to 1, and the indices of the VACV P11K promoter (P11) and PE/L were 24.5 and 49.2, respectively, since P11 and PE/L were reported to be 24.5 and 49.2 times stronger than P7.5, respectively [15]. The index of PE/L at the J2R locus was half of the index of the PE/L at the F14.5L locus (24.6) since the gene encoding human transferring receptor was inserted in the reverse orientation with respect to the promoter. Secondly, the promoter scores for GLV-1h68 and its derivatives were calculated by adding together the index of each inserted promoter remaining in each virus strain. The resulting promoter scores for GLV-1h68, GLV-1h70 (gusA -), GLV-1h71 (RUC-GFP -), GLV-1h72 (lacZ -), GLV-1h73 (RUC-GFP -/gusA -), and GLV-1h74 (RUC-GFP -/lacZ -/gusA -) were 99.3, 74.8, 50.1, 73.7, 25.6, and 0, respectively. Regression analysis indicated that there was an inverse correlation between the promoter scores and the virus replication efficiency in the GI-101A cell culture with a value of R 2 being 0.9968 (Figure ?(Figure2C).2C). Thus, replication efficiency of GLV-1h68 and its derivatives in the cell culture inversely correlated with added strength of the inserted promoters remaining in each viral genome. Foreign gene expression cassette removal derivatives kill tumor cells in culture more efficiently than their parental virus GLV-1h68. After demonstrating that vaccinia virus replication efficiency in cell cultures was inversely proportionate to the number of foreign gene expression cassettes present within the viral genome and inversely correlated with the strength of promoters inserted into each viral genome, we compared the tumor cell-killing potential of each virus strain. Human breast tumor GI-101A cells were infected with each virus strain at an MOI of 0.01, and cell viability was measured daily for 5 d after infection. In general, the number of viable cells continued to increase until 2d after infection owing to the fact that only a small portion of cells was initially infected at the low MOI. Compared with mock infection, GLV-1h68 infection resulted in a significant decrease in the number of viable cells at 96 and 120 hpi (P < 0.01, 0.001, respectively). All foreign gene expression cassette removal derivatives showed significantly more efficient tumor cell killing than their parent virus GLV-1h68 at certain time points after infection (Figure ?(Figure3).3). There was a general trend that virus strains with higher replication efficiency also killed cancer cells more efficiently. Thus, virus replication efficiency was in accord with its tumor cell-killing capacity. Replication efficiency of GLV-1h68 and its derivatives in tumor xenografts positively correlates with their replication efficiency in cell cultures. To compare replication efficiency of GLV-1h68 and each of its derivatives in tumor xenografts, nude mice bearing the GI-101A tumors were injected intravenously (i.v.) with each virus strain at 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 pfu per mouse. Tumors were harvested at 14 days post virus administration. Viral titers in tumors were determined in CV-1 cells using standard plaque assays. As shown in Figure ?Figure4A,4A, GLV-1h73 (RUC-GFP -/gusA -) and GLV-1h74 (RUC-GFP -/lacZ -/gusA -) with two and three of the foreign expression cassettes removed, respectively, gave significantly higher virus yields than their parental virus GLV-1h68. Although there was no statistically significant difference in virus yield between GLV-1h68 and single cassette-replaced virus strains, these virus strains consistently gave higher virus yields than GLV-1h68 in the GI-101A and other different tumor models tested (Figure ?(Figure4A).4A). Regression analysis indicated that there was a linear correlation between virus yields in the GI-101A tumors and that in the GI-101A cell culture (Figure ?(Figure4B4B). Enhanced virus replication efficiency predicts enhanced antitumor efficacy. After demonstrating that removal of the marker gene expression cassettes enhanced virus replication and tumor cell killing in cell cultures as well as virus replication in tumors, we sought to determine if enhanced virus replication could be translated into improved therapeutic efficacy. Nude mice bearing the GI-101A tumors of 200-300 mm 3 were injected i.v. with each virus strain at a single dose of 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 pfu/mouse. Tumor volume was monitored weekly for 84 days. As depicted in Figure ?Figure5A,5A, not surprisingly, GLV-1h68 efficiently shrank the GI-101A tumors as demonstrated before [10]. All the derivatives showed enhanced tumor-shrinking capability compared with the parental virus GLV-1h68. Strikingly, tumors treated with GLV-1h74 (RUC-GFP -/lacZ -/gusA -) with all of the foreign expression cassettes excised, stopped growing three weeks after virus administration, which was two weeks earlier than the date when GLV-1h68-treated tumors ceased to grow. Overall, virus strains that replicated more efficiently in the GI-101A cell culture, also shank the GI-101A tumors faster. Enhanced virus replication efficiency predicts increased virulence in nude mice. To evaluate if removal of the foreign gene expression cassettes from GLV-1h68 would affect virus virulence in mice, groups of 6 nude mice bearing the GI-101A tumors were treated with each virus strain individually as described above for the efficacy study (untreated group had 4 mice). Mouse survival was monitored daily. Due to excessive tumor burden, all untreated mice were sacrificed 102 days after tumor cell implantation (equivalent to 68 days post treatment for the treated groups). All treated groups were observed for 84 days after virus treatment. During this period, all mice treated with GLV-1h71 (RUC-GFP -) survived and looked healthy. Two mice each treated with GLV-1h68 or GLV-1h72 (lacZ -) died. Three, 5, and all 6 mice treated with GLV-1h70 (gusA -), GLV-1h73 (RUC-GFP -/gusA -), and GLV-1h74 (RUC-GFP -/lacZ -/gusA -) died, respectively. Statistically, there was a significant difference in survival between the GLV-1h68 treated group and the GLV-1h74-treated group, but no significant difference between GLV-1h68 treated group and any other virus-treated groups (Figure ?(Figure5B).5B). Thus, excision of one of the foreign expression cassettes from GLV-1h68 seemed not to significantly affect virus virulence, whereas removal of all of three foreign expression cassettes significantly enhanced virus virulence. Although there was no significant difference in survival between GLV-1h68 treated group and GLV-1h73 (RUC-GFP -/gusA -) treated group, we consistently observed higher virulence associated with GLV-1h73 (RUC-GFP -/gusA -) than GLV-1h68 in additional tumor models. Overall, virus virulence in tumorous mice directly reflected the replication efficiency of these virus strains in cell cultures. Discussion. GLV-1h68, one of the most widely studied oncolytic VACVs, has been shown to be effective in treating large numbers of human and canine cancers in preclinical studies [10,16-24]. It is currently being evaluated in phase I/II clinical trials http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. GLV-1h68 was derived from the wild-type VACV LIVP by insertional inactivation of the ORFs F14.5L, J2R, and A56R [10]. Our previous studies demonstrated that GLV-1h68 was much attenuated in nude mice compared with its parental virus strains [10,11]. Inactivation of F14.5L, J2R, and A56R was previously shown to reduce VACV virulence in mice [11,25-27]. In this study, we decided to determine how much the expression of foreign marker genes, in addition to viral gene interruption, contributed to the level of attenuation of GLV-1h68. When an individual foreign gene expression cassette was replaced with a short non-coding DNA sequence, replacement of any single expression cassettes resulted in elevated replication in cell cultures compared to their parent virus GLV-1h68. Replacement of the RUC-GFP expression cassette resulted in the most enhanced virus replication, probably owing to the fact that the synthetic early/late promoter that drives RUC-GFP expression is the strongest in comparison with the other promoters [15]. GLV-1h73 (RUC-GFP -/gusA -) with two of the foreign gene expression cassettes removed replicated more efficiently than any of the virus strains with single foreign gene expression cassette removed. GLV-1h74 (RUC-GFP -/lacZ -/gusA -) in which all three foreign expression cassettes were replaced, demonstrated the highest replication efficiency among all the virus strains tested. Interestingly, we have noticed that replication efficiency of GLV-1h68 and its foreign gene removal derivatives was inversely proportionate to the added strength of the promoters present at the loci of F14.5L, J2R, and A56R in each virus strain. Thus, the expression of the foreign genes driven by the VACV promoters that adds an extra transcriptional and translational burden onto the virus and infected cells contributed to the attenuation of GLV-1h68 replication. Since the degree of attenuation of VACV strains is proportionate to the strength of promoters that drive foreign gene expression, therefore, it may be possible to fine tune VACV replication efficiency by choosing VACV promoters of appropriate strength to facilitate foreign gene expression in VACV as was demonstrated for the first time in this study. The mechanisms by which oncolytic viruses destroy tumors are currently under intense investigation. It is believed that an unarmed oncolytic virus destroys tumors through one, or most likely, a combination of the following mechanisms: 1) by direct viral oncolysis of tumor cells; 2) by destruction of the tumor vasculature [4,28]; and 3) by induction of host antitumoral immune responses [29,30]. However, importance of each mechanism is still a matter of controversy, and might be dependent on types of tumors, viruses, and hosts studied. Kirn et al. reported that a VACV WR-derived oncolytic virus infected tumor-associated vascular endothelial cells, resulting in vascular collapse in infected tumors [31]. In contrast, we recently showed that the oncolytic VACV GLV-1h68 did not destroy endothelial cells in tumors. The tumor vasculature in infected tumors was still functional [32]. These differences in the results might reflect differences in the cell tropisms of VACV WR and LIVP derived virus strains, and/or might be tumor type dependent. In a study investigating the role of antitumor immunity in comparison to the role of direct oncolysis in reovirus-mediated virotherapy, Prestwich et al. found that the immune response, but not direct viral oncolysis or replication, was a critical factor for reovirus-mediated tumor rejection or therapy [33]. Previously, we reported massive VACV-mediated intratumoral inflammations in GLV-1h68-infected tumors [10]. However, following studies indicated that VACV-mediated immune responses were not essential for tumor elimination [32]. Instead, viral-mediated direct tumor cell killing seems to be a key factor for GLV-1h68-mediated oncolytic virotherapy, suggesting that enhanced virus replication efficiency and viral spreading within the tumor tissue may drastically improve therapeutical outcome. In this study, we generated a series of recombinant VACVs with different replication efficiency, which allowed us to evaluate the correlation between virus replication efficiency and therapeutical efficacy. The results described here indicated that enhanced virus replication efficiency resulted in enhanced tumor cell killing in cell cultures and similarly enhanced virus replication in tumor xenografts, yielding enhanced therapeutical efficacy. These data further strengthen previous reports that viral oncolysis is the most critical in tumor rejection and elimination [32]. Safety is a major concern for any cancer therapeutics. During the past years, strategies have been developed to enhance tumor selectivity and clinical safety of oncolytic viruses [3]. These strategies include: 1) inactivation of viral genes; 2) transcriptional targeting; 3) regulation of mRNA stability; 4) mRNA translational control; and 5) transductional targeting. Inactivation of viral genes is the main strategy currently used to enhance tumor specific replication of VACV strains [8]. However, it was reported that an increase in attenuation resulted in a decrease in therapeutic efficacy [9]. Therefore, it is important to fine balance virulence and efficacy. GLV-1h68 was shown to be safe in numerous tumor xenograft models. Here, we showed that removal of the foreign expression cassettes from GLV-1h68 resulted in increased virulence in mice. Although removal of one of the three inserted foreign gene expression cassettes seemed not to significantly enhance virus virulence, removal of two of the three foreign gene expression cassettes simultaneously resulted in consistently increased virus virulence. Removal of all three foreign gene expression cassettes at the same time resulted in a virus strain with a significant increase in virus virulence. The foreign gene expression cassettes inserted into GLV-1h68 seems to help limit virus virulence in mice. Conclusions. Taken together, we have shown that virus promoter driven expression of foreign genes did in fact attenuate VACV replication. We found that virus replication efficiency was inversely proportionate to the added strength of promoters linked to foreign genes inserted into the viral genome. Thus, we propose that VACV replication can be fine tuned through carefully choosing the strength of promoters added to the VACV genome for the expression of foreign genes. Furthermore, VACV replication efficiency in cell cultures paralleled cytotoxicity in cell cultures, and importantly, replication efficiency in tumors as well as therapeutic efficacy in nude mice. However, enhanced virus replication efficiency in cell cultures resulted in increased virulence in mice. In conclusion, GLV-1h68 seems to have well balanced replication efficiency and minimum virulence in mice to achieve highly efficacious tumor rejection in nude mice with human xenografts. Virus strain attenuation by insertion of additional viral promoters of different strength into the VACV genome may result in rationally designed safe attenuated therapeutic strains, presumably due to competition for VACV RNA polymerase and cellular translation machinery required to facilitate transcription and translation of viral genes.

                "text": "Tumor suppressive activity of prolyl isomerase Pin1 in renal cell carcinoma\tPin1 specifically recognizes and catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of phosphorylated-Ser/Thr-Pro bonds, which modulate the stability, localization, and function of numerous Pin1 targets involved in tumor progression. However, the role of Pin1 in cancer remains enigmatic as the gene is located on chromosome 19p13.2, which is a region subject to loss of heterozygosity in several tumors. Since Pin1 protein is frequently under-expressed in kidney cancer, we have explored its role in human clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Here we show evidence for PIN1 gene deletion and mRNA under-expression as a mechanism of Pin1 reduction in ccRCC tumors. We demonstrate that restoration of Pin1 in cell lines found to be deficient in Pin1 protein expression can attenuate the growth of ccRCC cells in soft agar and a xenograft tumor model. Moreover, this ability of Pin1 to negatively influence tumor growth in ccRCC cells may be dependent on the presence of functional p53, which is infrequently mutated in ccRCC. These observations suggest Pin1 may have a mild tumor suppressive role in ccRCC. 1. Introduction. Pin1 is a conserved peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that specifically recognizes phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline motifs (pS/T-P) (Yaffe et al., 1997). By catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of pS/T-P bonds, Pin1 induces conformational changes in its target phosphoproteins that can alter their biological function and/or stability (Lu and Zhou, 2007). Several proteins important for cell cycle and cancer progression are regulated by Pin1, including \u00a5\u00e2-catenin, c-Jun, c-Myc, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and p53 (Liou et al., 2002; Ryo et al., 2001; Wulf et al., 2001; Yeh et al., 2004; Yeh et al., 2006; Zacchi et al., 2002; Zheng et al., 2002). Since these targets are key regulators of G1-S progression, Pin1 has been suggested to function as a molecular timer for the cell cycle (Yeh and Means, 2007). Indeed, the loss of Pin1 in multiple cell types, such as Pin1 -/- primordial germ cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), leads to prolongation of G0-G1-S progression (Atchison et al., 2003; Fujimori et al., 1999; You et al., 2002). Such a delay could be explained by Pin1\u00a1\u00afs ability to promote the expression and stabilization of cyclin D1, underscoring the potential importance of Pin1 in cancer. A number of studies report prevalent Pin1 over-expression in human cancers, including those of breast and prostate (Ayala et al., 2003; Bao et al., 2004; Wulf et al., 2001). In breast cancer, Pin1 over-expression correlates with the deregulation of cyclin D1, which is likely the result of enhanced transcription of this gene by c-Jun and \u00a5\u00e2-catenin as well as post-translational stabilization of the protein (Ryo et al., 2001; Wulf et al., 2001). Pin1 levels also correlate with poor clinical outcome and may have prognostic value in the case of prostate cancer (Ayala et al., 2003). Based on these studies, one might conclude that increased levels of Pin1 promote tumor progression. However, and perhaps not surprising given the plethora of Pin1 targets, the role of Pin1 in human cancer is complex and context dependent. In fact, several reports suggest Pin1 might inhibit tumor progression by destabilizing oncoproteins (i.e. cyclin E, c-Myc) or by activating tumor suppressors (i.e. p53, p73) (Yeh and Means, 2007). Previously, we showed that cyclin E is stabilized in Pin1 -/- C57BL6 MEF, which correlated with defective cell cycle progression and accelerated genomic instability (Yeh et al., 2006). Moreover, Pin1 -/- MEF cells transformed with p53 DD and/or H-Ras G12V when grown as xenografts displayed reduced tumor free survival and increased tumor growth compared to wild type MEF, which suggests Pin1 may exhibit a tumor suppressive effect in these cells. Since Pin1 appears to play a tumor promoting or inhibitory role depending on the genetic context, Pin1 has been described as a \u00a1\u00b0conditional\u00a1\u00b1 tumor suppressor (Yeh and Means, 2007). However, Pin1-mediated tumor suppressive effects in a human context have yet to be demonstrated. Interestingly, Pin1 is prevalently under-expressed in some human cancers, including kidney cancer (Bao et al., 2004). Although the relevance of Pin1 underexpression in kidney cancer has not been evaluated, the effect of differential Pin1 levels on tumor progression likely depends on the specific repertoire of genetic mutations acquired by the cancer cells. In particular, although p53 is commonly mutated in many human cancers, p53 mutation is infrequent in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Dalgliesh et al., 2010; Gurova et al., 2004). Since Pin1 has been shown to positively regulate p53, one hypothesis is that Pin1 can exert a tumor suppressive role in a manner dependent on wild type p53. Herein, we evaluate the role of Pin1 in RCC and find support for this hypothesis. 2. Materials and Methods. 2.1 Copy number analysis. SNP6.0 array data corresponding to gene expression data deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE17818\",\"term_id\":\"17818\"}}GSE17818 (Dalgliesh et al., 2010) were obtained from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Hinxton, Cambridge, UK). Raw allele intensities were imported into Partek Genomics Suite software, version 6.5 (St. Louis, MO, USA). Based on the PCA plot, one outlying tumor and corresponding normal were excluded, batch effect was removed, and copy number values were created from allele intensities. Genomic segmentation was performed with segmentation parameters of a minimum of 10 genomic markers, p-value threshold of 0.001, and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3. Identified regions were visualized using the Plot Chromosome function within Partek Genomic Suite. 2.2 Gene expression analysis. PIN1 gene expression levels were examined from previously described gene expression data (Brannon et al., 2010), which was re-downloaded with 44 additional new tumor samples from the UNC Microarray Database in log2 Lowess-normalized sample/reference format (median), filtered for 70% of probes present above background levels and annotated using the 20101031 Agilent annotation release. The data was imported into Partek Genomics Suite software and batch effect was removed through Partek\u00a1\u00afs batch effect removal algorithms. All human studies were approved by the University of North Carolina Biomedical Institutional Review Board and Office of Human Research Ethics. 2.3 Cell lines and antibodies. Primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were cultured in REGM Renal Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Human renal cell carcinoma ACHN and A498 cells, and human embryonic kidney 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in Dulbecco\u00a1\u00afs modified Eagle\u00a1\u00afs medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Mediatech). Cells were maintained at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a 5% CO 2 humidified incubator. The following antibodies were used: anti-Pin1 (Winkler et al., 2000), anti-\u00a5\u00e2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-Ki67 (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA, USA), IRDye800-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA, USA), and Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 2.4 Retrovirus preparation and transduction. Pin1 shRNA construct was generated by inserting a sequence targeting 5\u00a1\u00c7-CTGCCACCGTCACACAGTA-3\u00a1\u00c7 into pSUPER. Non-silencing control shRNA construct pSUPER.Mamm-X was obtained from Oligoengine (Seattle, WA, USA). Pin1 expression construct was created by PCR amplifying the human Pin1 cDNA from pGEX-2TK-Pin1 (Yi et al., 2005) and ligating it into the EcoRI-SalI sites of pBABE-neo. Site-directed mutagenesis of pBABE-neo-Pin1 WT to Pin1 W34A was carried out by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA). pBABE-puro-p53 DD construct was created by excising p53 DD from pBABE-hygro-p53 DD (Yeh et al., 2006), then inserting it into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pBABE-puro. Retroviruses were produced in 293T cells following established methods (O\u00a1\u00afHayer and Counter, 2006). ACHN cells were infected with retrovirus, then stably selected using 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) or 2 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 7-10 days. 2.5 Immunoblotting. Equal amounts of protein sample were resolved using SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-FL membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Quantitative immunoblotting was carried out using procedures established by LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE, USA). 2.6 RT-PCR. RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Transgenic expression of p53 DD was verified by RT-PCR as previously described (Adam and Counter, 2008). 2.7 Soft agar assay. Cellular transformation was evaluated by soft agar assay as previously described (O\u00a1\u00afHayer and Counter, 2006). Briefly, 2.5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 ACHN cells were seeded per well of a 6-well plate. Cells were fed with 0.2 ml of culture media every 3-4 days for 21 days. Colonies greater than 30 cells were counted under a light microscope. Images were acquired with a Sony DSC-W50 (New York, NY, USA) attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 10 Microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) using a CamAdapter Kit (The Microscope Store, Wirtz, VA, USA). 2.8 Xenograft tumor model. Five hundred thousand or 10 6 ACHN cells were subcutaneously injected into each flank of athymic nude mice using protocols approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Tumor dimensions were measured every 3-4 days with calipers until largest tumors reached 0.8cm in length, after which the animals were sacrificed. Xenograft tumors were fixed with formalin and embedded in paraffin for tissue sectioning. 2.9 Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical staining was performed as previously published (Chen et al., 2010). TUNEL assay was performed using ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore). High resolution images were captured using an Infinity 2-3 Camera (Lumenera Corporation, Ottawa, ON, Canada) affixed to an Olympus CX41 Microscope (Center Valley, PA, USA). No primary antibody control images are provided in Supplementary Figure 3. Average percent DAB-positive staining was quantified from 10 different fields per tumor using ImmunoRatio (Tuominen et al., 2010) or blinded manual cell counting. 2.10 Statistical analysis. Bar graphs show mean \u00a1\u00be standard error of the indicated number of experiments or samples. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel and StatView. Cutoff for statistical significance was arbitrarily set at P<0.05. * denotes significant and ** denotes highly significant, with specific P values indicated in the figure legends. 3. Results. 3.1 PIN1 gene is frequently deleted and under-expressed in human clear cell RCC (ccRCC). Previous studies indicate that the Pin1 protein is prevalently under-expressed in kidney tumors compared to normal kidney tissue (Bao et al., 2004). As shown in Figure 1A, we determined that Pin1 under-expression in kidney cancer may be in part due to deletion of the PIN1 locus from chromosome 19p13.2, and resultant haploinsufficiency, as copy number analysis revealed Pin1 loss in 24 of 86 (28%) ccRCC tumors. In order to evaluate the effective mRNA expression level of the PIN1 gene, we examined 18 renal tumor and normal kidney paired samples for relative PIN1 gene expression. We observed that the PIN1 gene was underexpressed in 4 of 18 (22%) ccRCC tumors relative to paired normal kidney tissue (Figure 1B), which correlates with the frequency of PIN1 deletion observed in ccRCC. Since genetic loss of function is a hallmark of tumor suppressors, we further assessed the relevance of Pin1 under-expression in ccRCC by gene set analysis (GSA). GSA revealed low Pin1 levels correlate with reduced expression of genes involved in p53 stabilization as well as mitotic cell cycle pathways (Supplementary Figure 1). In addition, depressed Pin1 levels are associated with increased expression of genes involved in metastasis, stem cell-related, and proliferation pathways (Supplementary Figure 1). Collectively, these observations are compatible with the hypothesis that Pin1 may have tumor suppressive function in ccRCC. 3.2 Pin1 attenuates growth of ccRCC cells in soft agar. To test if Pin1 could serve a tumor suppressive role, we selected two RCC cell lines that displayed reduced expression of Pin1 protein, ACHN and A498 (Figure 2A; Supplementary Figure 2A). The rescue of reduced Pin1 levels to ~1.5-fold normal levels with ectopic expression of Pin1 was sufficient to modestly, but significantly inhibit the growth of both ACHN and A498 cells in soft agar (Figure 2A-C; Supplementary Figure 2). Since A498 cells formed fewer and much smaller colonies, ACHN cells were chosen for further analysis of Pin1-mediated effects. To evaluate the importance of Pin1\u00a1\u00afs WW-domain in tumor suppressive activity, ACHN cells were transduced with Pin1 W34A, a WW-domain mutant incapable of binding to and isomerizing Pin1 substrates (Lu et al., 1999). Although Pin1 W34A was expressed at a level similar to Pin1 WT (Figure 2A), Pin1 W34A was unable to diminish the growth of ACHN cells in soft agar (Figure 2B, C). This result suggests a functional WW-domain and canonical activity of Pin1 are essential for Pin1-mediated inhibition of anchorage independent growth. Conversely to ectopic Pin1 expression, further Pin1 depletion from ACHN cells by shRNA (Figure 2D) was associated with a 47% increase in soft agar colony formation (Figure 2E, F). These data demonstrate Pin1 can impede the growth of ccRCC cells in soft agar, which is consistent with tumor suppressive activity. 3.3 Pin1 attenuates ACHN tumor growth in a xenograft model. To further examine the role of Pin1 in tumor growth, ACHN-Neo (vector control) and ACHN-Pin1 cells rescued with ectopic Pin1 expression were assayed for tumorigenicity in a xenograft model. Consistent with our soft agar assay data, Pin1 expression significantly improved tumor free survival and suppressed the tumorigenic growth of ACHN xenografts (Figure 3A, B). ACHN-Pin1 tumors were histologically similar to ACHN-Neo control tumors, which exhibited necrotic cores surrounded by proliferating cells (Figure 3C). In addition, Pin1 immunohistochemical analysis showed ACHN-Pin1 tumors retained elevated levels of Pin1 (Figure 3D), and thus did not grow as a result of escaping Pin1 over-expression. To explore the means by which Pin1 expression impeded xenograft growth, we compared rates of proliferation and apoptosis in the xenografts. Ectopic Pin1 expressing tumors displayed significantly reduced Ki67 staining, indicating that Pin1 contributes to decreased RCC tumor growth by inhibiting cellular proliferation (Figure 4A). Indeed, ACHN-Pin1 tumors showed a 29% decrease in the number of Ki67-positive nuclei (Figure 4C), which is comparable to the impaired growth of ACHN-Pin1 cells in soft agar (Figure 2C), and is consistent with our GSA showing that Pin1 negatively correlates with genes involved in proliferation (Supplementary Figure 1). Intriguingly, ectopic rescue of Pin1 also led to increased apoptosis in the xenograft tumors as measured by TUNEL staining (Figure 4B, D). Thus ectopic Pin1 expression attenuates ACHN tumor growth through effects on both proliferation and apoptosis. 3.4 Repression of p53 activity can prevent Pin1-mediated tumor inhibitory activity. Since previous research suggests Pin1 can enhance p53 function in order to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress (Zacchi et al., 2002; Zheng et al., 2002), we hypothesized that the Pin1-mediated growth inhibitory effect on tumors might require functional p53, which is known to be wild type in ACHN cells (O\u00a1\u00afConnor et al., 1997; Warburton et al., 2005). To test this hypothesis, p53 was specifically inhibited in ACHN-Pin1 cells by a dominant negative p53 (p53 DD) mutant that we have previously utilized (Yeh et al., 2006). Expression of p53 DD and Pin1 was verified by RT-PCR or immunoblot, respectively (Figure 5A, B). As shown in Figure 5C-E, as expected, the inhibition of p53 by p53 DD enhanced growth in soft agar and in xenograft; however, ectopic Pin1 rescue in this setting failed to suppress soft agar colony formation or xenograft tumor growth. Therefore Pin1-mediated tumor inhibitory activity in RCC appears to require functional p53. 4. Discussion. Here we provide the first demonstration of Pin1-mediated tumor inhibitory activity in human cancer cells. The restoration of Pin1 expression in Pin1-deficient ccRCC cells produced reductions in tumor cell growth in soft agar, as well as in xenograft model growth. These effects although modest, were significant, and would be expected to have substantial consequences over the long natural history of renal cell carcinoma. Because tumorigenicity was not ablated, we have referred to Pin1 as a protein with tumor inhibitory activity, rather than a nascent tumor suppressor. Moreover, Pin1\u00a1\u00afs tumor inhibitory effects in renal carcinoma cells seem to require functional p53, as p53 inhibition was sufficient to prevent Pin1-mediated tumor suppressive activity in these cells. This result suggests the possibility that Pin1 acts to attenuate tumor cell growth in conditions in which p53 signaling is intact, and is consistent with the physiologic role of Pin1 in positively regulating p53 biological function, which has been previously documented (Berger et al., 2005; Mantovani et al., 2007; Zacchi et al., 2002; Zheng et al., 2002). As the PIN1 gene is frequently deleted in ccRCC tumors and Pin1 exhibits tumor attenuating activity in p53 wild type ccRCC cell lines, but not those in which p53 is inhibited, we surmise that Pin1 may play an important role in cancer biology to conditionally inhibit growth in some scenarios while exerting tumor promoting activities in other contexts. Certainly, the concept of a protein functioning with conditional tumor suppressive activity is not novel. Indeed, there are several proteins reported to possess tumor suppressing or promoting activity depending on the genetic context, including deleted in colon cancer (DCC), netrin-1 and transforming growth factor \u00a5\u00e2 (TGF\u00a5\u00e2) (Massague, 2008; Mazelin et al., 2004). In \u00a1\u00b0normal\u00a1\u00b1 contexts, TGF\u00a5\u00e2 mediates tumor suppression through mechanisms that regulate cytostasis, apoptosis, and differentiation. However, TGF\u00a5\u00e2 can alternatively promote the growth and metastasis of tumors containing certain genetic mutations or deletions that disable TGF\u00a5\u00e2\u00a1\u00afs tumor suppressive function. The example of TGF\u00a5\u00e2 interestingly seems to share some parallels with what has been observed for Pin1 in cancer. Since Pin1 has been shown to function to either decrease or enhance tumor growth, we speculate that mutations that disable Pin1\u00a1\u00afs tumor suppressing activities (i.e. p53 mutation) may enhance Pin1\u00a1\u00afs tumor promoting activities (i.e. cyclin D1 over-expression) in these contexts. Notably, frequent Pin1 over-expression correlating with high cyclin D1 expression has been shown to occur in human cancers where p53 is frequently mutated, including breast and liver cancers (Pang et al., 2004; Wulf et al., 2001). On the other hand, frequent Pin1 under-expression has been most commonly observed in cancers where p53 is frequently wild type, including kidney and testicular cancers (Bao et al., 2004; Gurova et al., 2004; Heimdal et al., 1993). Based on these observations, the role of Pin1 as an inhibitor of human tumorigenesis seems to be highly dependent on the tumor cell context. In ccRCC which harbors infrequent mutations of p53 and other common mediators of tumorigenesis, Pin1 appears to play a mild tumor suppressive role, and further investigation is warranted to ascertain if Pin1 could be a useful prognostic factor or therapeutic target in human cancer.

                "text": "TRAF6 is an amplified oncogene bridging the RAS and NF-\u00a5\u00eaB pathways in human lung cancer\tSomatic mutations and copy number alterations (as a result of deletion or amplification of large portions of a chromosome) are major drivers of human lung cancers. Detailed analysis of lung cancer?associated chromosomal amplifications could identify novel oncogenes. By performing an integrative cytogenetic and gene expression analysis of non?small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and tumors, we report here the identification of a frequently recurring amplification at chromosome 11 band p13. Within this region, only TNF receptor?associated factor 6 (TRAF6) exhibited concomitant mRNA overexpression and gene amplification in lung cancers. Inhibition of TRAF6 in human lung cancer cell lines suppressed NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor formation. In these lung cancer cell lines, RAS required TRAF6 for its oncogenic capabilities. Furthermore, TRAF6 overexpression in NIH3T3 cells resulted in NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor formation. Our findings show that TRAF6 is an oncogene that is important for RAS-mediated oncogenesis and provide a mechanistic explanation for the previously apparent importance of constitutive NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation in RAS-driven lung cancers. Introduction. Characterization of the genome has revealed genes critical to the malignant landscape of human lung cancers. The 2 major forms of lung cancer are non?small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC represents the majority of all lung cancers at 85%, compared with 15% for SCLC (1). NSCLCs are histologically subdivided into squamous cell carcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. Somatic activating mutations of v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) are the most frequent genetic events in NSCLC, occurring in greater than 30% of cases (1). Despite the prominence of MAPK pathway activation by RAS, NF-\u00a5\u00eaB also appears to be an essential pathway for KRAS-mediated NSCLC (2). The importance of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB is further supported by reports of constitutive NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation in more than 50% of lung cancers (3). Despite high levels of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation in lung tumors and a critical role in RAS-mediated lung cancer formation in vivo, the mechanisms leading to constitutive NF-\u00a5\u00eaB are not known. Although KRAS mutations are rare in SCLC, activating mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) are among the most frequent in SCLC and thought to require the KRAS pathway for lung malignancies (4). Inactivating mutations of TP53 are also common in NSCLCs (50%?80%) and SCLCs (80%?100%) (1). In addition to somatic mutations, recurring cytogenetic alterations are also associated with lung cancers. Common deletions involving 5q11.2 (PDE4D), 7q11.22 (AUTS2), 9p21.3 (CDKN2A and CDKN2B), and 10q23.31 (PTEN) harbor known and candidate tumor suppressor genes (5). In contrast, recurring amplifications of 1q21.2 (ARNT), 5p15.3 (TERT), 7p11.2 (EGFR), 7q31.2 (MET), 8q24.21 (MYC), 11q13.3 (CCND1), 12p12.1 (KRAS), 14q13.3 (NKX2-1; also known as TITF1), and 17q12 (ERBB2) harbor known oncogenes (5, 6), implicating DNA amplifications as a mechanism of oncogene activation in lung cancers (7). In an attempt to identify novel oncogenes within lung cancer?associated amplicons, we performed a large-scale integrative cytogenetic and gene expression analysis of lung cancer cell lines and tumors. Here we report the identification of a frequently recurring amplification at chromosome 11p13. Examination of genes within the minimally amplified region on 11p13 revealed that TNF receptor?associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is a key candidate oncogene. Overexpression of TRAF6 in nontransformed cells resulted in NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor formation. In contrast, inhibition of TRAF6 in human lung cancer cells suppressed NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor formation. Furthermore, RAS was dependent on TRAF6 for anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation. Therefore, the present study identifies TRAF6 as a commonly amplified oncogene bridging RAS and NF-\u00a5\u00eaB in lung cancer. Results. High-resolution and whole-genome DNA platforms have allowed for reanalysis of tumor samples and identification of cryptic alterations. To identify novel genomic alterations in lung cancers, we used whole-genome tiling path array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to determine copy number changes for 346 NSCLC and SCLC samples (85 cell lines and 261 primary tumors). Significance of recurrent gains or deletions was determined for the lung cancer cell lines using Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC), a statistical method that calculates significance scores incorporating the amplitude and frequency of copy number alterations at each position in the genome (8). GISTIC analysis identified 5 significant high-level focal copy number amplifications (log 2 ratio > 0.8) across the 85 lung cancer cell lines (Figure ?(Figure1A):1A): in decreasing order of significance, these were 14q13.2 (q = 0.0013), 11p13 (q = 0.015), 1q21.2 (q = 0.048), 5p15.33 (q = 0.085), and 7p12.1 (q = 0.19). Amplifications of 1q21.2, 5p15.33, 7p12.1, and 14q13.2 have been previously reported in lung adenocarcinomas and revealed to harbor known lung cancer oncogenes (ARNT, TERT, EGFR, and NKX2-1, respectively), indicative of consistency between array platforms (5, 9). Although the amplicon associated with 11p13 has been previously reported and is thought to be a predictive marker in lung adenocarcinomas (7, 10), to our knowledge, the relevance to human lung cancer is not known. High-level amplification of 11p13 was the second most significant event in our panel of NSCLC and SCLC cell lines (q = 0.015277), with the peak amplified region identified by GISTIC spanning an approximately 4-Mb interval (32,126,542?37,251,933 Mb) that contains 26 protein-coding genes (Figure ?(Figure1B),1B), none of which have been previously implicated in lung cancer. To identify candidate target genes, we next searched for concomitantly amplified and overexpressed genes within this interval by integrating parallel genetic and gene expression data for the cell lines. Of the 26 genes in the peak region, only TRAF6 (36,467,531?36,488,372 bp) expression was positively and significantly associated with gene amplification (adjusted P = 0.01) (Figure ?(Figure1C,1C, Supplemental Figure 1, and Supplemental Table 1; supplemental material available online with this article; doi: 10.1172/JCI58818DS1). Consistent with TRAF6 mRNA overexpression (Supplemental Figure 1), TRAF6 protein was approximately 2-fold higher in lung cell lines with 11p13 amplification (n = 5) than in samples with diploid 11p13 (n = 4) (Figure ?(Figure1D). 1D). In total, TRAF6 amplification was observed in 17 of 85 (20%) of the lung cancer cell lines, with the vast majority (88%) belonging to the NSCLC subtype (Table ?(Table11 and Supplemental Table 2). To confirm the cell line findings, we expanded our analysis to a panel of 261 clinical NSCLC tumor samples. Of these tumors, 24 (9.2%) had a copy number increase of the TRAF6 genomic locus (Table ?(Table1),1), highlighting its potential clinical relevance. Furthermore, examination of matched gene expression data for lung tumor samples revealed a significant association between copy number amplification and TRAF6 mRNA overexpression (P = 0.035; Figure ?Figure1E),1E), further validating our cell line findings (Supplemental Figure 1). Thus, our integrative genomic analyses identified TRAF6 as the target of the 11p13 amplicon, underlining a putative oncogenic role for this gene in lung cancer development. TRAF6 is a member of the TNF receptor?associated factor (TRAF) family of proteins and is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes autologous synthesis of lysine 63?linked (K63-linked) polyubiquitin chains involved in downstream activation of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB (11). Despite its prominent role in NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation, TRAF6 has not to our knowledge been directly associated with oncogenesis. To determine whether TRAF6 overexpression leads to malignant cellular transformation, we retrovirally expressed TRAF6 in nontransformed mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3) and evaluated cell growth and colony formation. Overexpression of TRAF6 resulted in enhanced cell proliferation in serum-deprived conditions (Figure ?(Figure2A),2A), formation of anchorage-independent colonies in soft agar comparable in size to colonies transformed with a constitutively active version of RAS, vH-RAS (P = 0.0047; Figure ?Figure2,2, B and C), and adoption of a spindle morphology and refractility, consistent with a transformed phenotype and similar to that of vH-RAS?transformed cells (Figure ?(Figure2C).2C). Vector-transduced cells were not refractile and grew in monolayers, morphologically resembling parental cells (Figure ?(Figure2C).2C). TRAF6- or vector-expressing NIH3T3 cells were injected subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice and monitored for tumor growth. TRAF6-expressing cells began to form tumors within 4 weeks (P = 0.011; Figure ?Figure2D),2D), and after 35 days, 80% (9 of 11) of mice developed large tumors (Figure ?(Figure2D).2D). Of the mice injected with control cells, only 1 developed a palpable tumor after 8 weeks (Figure ?(Figure2D).2D). These results are suggestive of the oncogenic capabilities of TRAF6, including the capacity to malignantly transform cells and form tumors. Individual TRAF6-expressing clones were isolated from soft agar and independently expanded in liquid culture for further analysis. We reevaluated 3 TRAF6 clones (designated C1, C2, and C3) for colony formation in soft agar; these exhibited increased colony-forming ability compared with parental TRAF6-expressing NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). Examination of the TRAF6 clones revealed a pronounced transformed phenotype, including increased refractility, spindle morphology, and multilayered growth (Figure ?(Figure2E).2E). All TRAF6 clones exhibited higher TRAF6 protein expression (~2-fold) than that of the parental TRAF6-expressing cells (Figure ?(Figure2F),2F), and TRAF6 protein positively correlated with enhanced colony formation (r 2 = 0.8032; P = 0.1; Figure ?Figure2G).2G). Consistent with a more aggressive transformed phenotype, tumor size was increased and latency reduced in the TRAF6 clones, approaching that of vH-RAS?induced tumors (Figure ?(Figure2,2, H and I). Therefore, a higher level of TRAF6 expression was associated with malignant transformation. To investigate the role of TRAF6 in cell survival and oncogenesis in human lung cancer, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the expression of TRAF6. We chose 6 human lung cancer lines based on 11p13 amplification, KRAS mutation status, and a RAS gene expression signature (ref. 12 and Supplemental Table 3). To reduce expression in H1395, H460, and HCC95 cell lines, 3 independent retroviral shRNAs targeting discrete regions of TRAF6 (shT6) were used, resulting in an approximately 50% knockdown of TRAF6 mRNA (Supplemental Figure 2). RNAi-mediated knockdown of TRAF6 significantly decreased the cell growth of adenocarcinoma lung lines HCC95 and SK-MES-1, which have TRAF6 amplification (P = 0.00036 and P = 0.025, respectively, at day 8; Figure ?Figure3A).3A). TRAF6 depletion also inhibited ? albeit not as effectively ? growth and viability of cell lines H460 and H2347, without an amplified TRAF6 locus but with a KRAS mutation (P = 0.01 and P = 0.034, respectively; Figure ?Figure3A).3A). Similarly, depletion of TRAF6 in lines H1395 and H520, without a TRAF6 amplification (low TRAF6 protein) or KRAS mutation, had no or moderate effect on cell growth (P = 0.14 and P = 0.006, respectively; Figure ?Figure3A).3A). Depletion of TRAF6 also led to a significant decrease in anchorage-independent colony growth of HCC95 (P = 1.3 \u00a1\u00bf 10 ?7), SK-MES-1 (P = 0.0009), H2347 (P = 4.9 \u00a1\u00bf 10 ?5), H460 (P = 2.2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 ?5), and H520 (P = 4.2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 ?5) cells, but not of H1395 cells (P = 0.25; Figure ?Figure3,3, B and C). In support of the growth and colony-forming data, cell viability was significantly reduced in H460 and HCC95 cells after TRAF6 depletion (P = 0.029; Figure ?Figure3D).3D). Given that we observed a TRAF6-dependent cell line that did not have KRAS mutation or TRAF6 amplification (H520), it is possible that other driver mutations affecting RAS or NF-\u00a5\u00eaB signaling occur in this cell line, making it sensitive to TRAF6 inhibition. We next subcutaneously injected shT6- or vector-expressing lung cancer cells into NOD/SCID mice and monitored tumor growth. Consistent with the colony formation observations, tumor-forming ability was significantly impaired after TRAF6 depletion in lines H460 and HCC95 (P = 0.001 and P = 0.013, respectively); however, TRAF6 knockdown in H1395 cells did not have an effect on tumor formation (Figure ?(Figure3,3, E?G). Overall, these observations demonstrate an oncogenic role of TRAF6 in human lung cancers and suggest that cells with 11p13 amplifications or KRAS mutations may depend on TRAF6 for cell viability and tumor formation. To determine whether other genes within the 11p13 amplicon are also relevant to the pathogenesis of human lung cancers, we evaluated 3 genes with P values approaching significance in our panel of lung cancers (see Supplemental Table 1). Inhibition of COMMD9 (P = 0.3), CD44 (P= 0.031), and TCP11L1 (P = 0.011) did not suppress colony formation as effectively as did TRAF6 inhibition (P = 0.00021; Supplemental Figure 3), which suggests that TRAF6 is the critical gene within the 11p13 amplicon. Somatic activating mutations of KRAS are the most frequent genetic events in NSCLCs (1). Despite the prominence of MAPK pathway activation by RAS (13, 14), NF-\u00a5\u00eaB is also essential for KRAS-mediated lung cancers in mouse models (2, 15, 16). The importance of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB is further supported by reports of constitutive NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation in more than 50% of human lung cancers (3). Despite high levels of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation in human lung tumors and a critical role in RAS-mediated lung cancer formation in vivo, the mechanisms leading to constitutive NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation in human lung cancers remains unknown. Because TRAF6 is an upstream activator of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB, we wanted to investigate whether TRAF6 is a key activator of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB in human lung cancer. Therefore, 8 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were evaluated for NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation. The lung lines with TRAF6 amplification and overexpression displayed increased NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation, as determined by \u00a5\u00eaB-site luciferase activity (11p13 amplification, 8.9 \u00a1\u00be 5.9; no 11p13 amplification, 3.5 \u00a1\u00be 1.5; P = 0.1), and by a shift toward nuclear translocation of the NF-\u00a5\u00eaB subunit, p65 (Figure ?(Figure4,4, A and B). Inhibition of TRAF6 in HCC95 (11p13 amplification) resulted in a significant decrease of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation (P = 0.0014; Figure ?Figure4C).4C). Inhibition of TRAF6 in H460 cells, which have a KRAS mutation, similarly resulted in a significant decrease of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation (P = 0.027; Figure ?Figure4D).4D). These findings suggest that increased TRAF6 expression is a potential cause of constitutive NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation in human lung cancers. We observed that TRAF6 inhibition reduced NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation and tumor formation of lung cancer cells with KRAS mutations (Figures ?(Figures33 and ?and4);4); therefore, we wanted to investigate whether TRAF6 is also an essential link in RAS-mediated tumorigenicity. To investigate a relationship between mutant KRAS and TRAF6 amplifications, we examined an additional 705 human cancer cell lines. As expected, samples with TRAF6 gain and/or amplification had significantly higher mRNA levels of this gene than did cell lines without TRAF6 copy number increase (P < 0.0001). In this panel of cell lines, KRAS mutations were enriched in samples with TRAF6 amplifications (17%; 21 of 125) compared with samples diploid at 11p13 (11%; 68 of 632; P = 0.043, Fisher exact test; Table ?Table2).2). Therefore, there was an association between KRAS mutation and TRAF6 copy number change, further supporting the interaction between these genes during tumorigenesis. E3 ligase?mediated autoubiquitination is a measure of TRAF6 activation. To determine whether RAS also activates TRAF6, we overexpressed constitutively active KRAS or vH-RAS, subjected TRAF6 to IP, and measured TRAF6 polyubiquitination. As shown in Figure ?Figure5A,5A, expression of KRAS activating mutant (V12) or vH-RAS resulted in autoubiquitination of TRAF6; however, an inactive KRAS mutant (N17) did not, validating previous findings (17). Inhibition of mutant KRAS abrogated TRAF6 autoubiquitination in an NSCLC cell line with mutant KRAS (Figure ?(Figure5B).5B). These findings suggest that TRAF6 activation may occur in human lung cancer through active KRAS, as previously proposed in other cellular contexts (17). RAS dependence on TRAF6 was evaluated by overexpressing vH-RAS, a constitutively active version of RAS (18), in Traf6 ?/? mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; Figure ?Figure5C)5C) or in NIH3T3 cells coexpressing a dominant-negative TRAF6 (T6DN) construct. In contrast to Traf6 +/+ cells (Figure ?(Figure5,5, D and F), vH-RAS?mediated anchorage-independent growth was completely abrogated in Traf6 ?/? cells (Figure ?(Figure5,5, D and F) and significantly reduced in NIH3T3 coexpressing T6DN (Figure ?(Figure5,5, E and F; P = 0.04). Similarly, the ability of vH-RAS?expressing cells to form tumors was completely abolished in the absence of TRAF6 (Figure ?(Figure5,5, G and H) and was significantly impaired when TRAF6 was blocked with T6DN (P = 0.053; Figure ?Figure5I).5I). These findings suggest that RAS-mediated anchorage-independent colony growth, tumor formation, and NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation are dependent on TRAF6. Given the prominent role of TRAF6 in human lung cancers, we hypothesized that the TRAF6 locus is also frequently amplified in other human cancers. By aCGH, we identified frequent amplification of the TRAF6 locus in a panel of 124 additional human cancer cell lines (Table ?(Table3).3). In addition, we investigated whether TRAF6 amplifications exist in a broader analysis of human cancer cell lines. In total, 757 cancer cell lines were analyzed, of which 126 (16.6%) displayed TRAF6 copy number gain and/or amplification. In a subset of 705 of these cell lines that had matching expression data, samples with TRAF6 gain and/or amplification had significantly higher mRNA levels of this gene compared with cell lines without TRAF6 copy number increase (P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test), confirming the findings from the lung cancer analyses. Beroukhim et al. also reported amplification of the TRAF6 locus as a somatic and frequent event in several human cancer types (19). In our analysis, breast cancers exhibited amplification of 11p13 in approximately 30% of samples. In these cell lines, TRAF6 mRNA overexpression also correlated with amplification of 11p13 (Supplemental Figure 4). Overexpression of T6DN in MCF7, a breast cell line with high levels of TRAF6 expression, abrogated anchorage-independent colony growth in vitro (P = 0.023; Supplemental Figure 4). In contrast, SKBR3, a breast cell line with lower levels of TRAF6, were not sensitive to TRAF6 inhibition (P = 0.32; Supplemental Figure 4). Discussion. TRAF6 functions as a molecular bridge and key activator of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB. Here, we identified TRAF6 as one of the amplified candidate oncogenes on chromosome 11p13 in lung cancer cells. Overexpression of TRAF6 resulted in malignant transformation of fibroblasts and tumor formation, whereas knockdown of TRAF6 suppressed human lung cancer growth and tumor formation. Our finding that deletion of TRAF6 by RNAi suppressed RAS-mediated tumor formation may have important implications in human lung cancers. KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in lung cancers; however, effective therapies to inhibit RAS do not exist (1). Therefore, identification of TRAF6 as a downstream effector of RAS tumorigenesis may provide an alternative target for therapeutic intervention. KRAS has been well documented as an activator of the NF-\u00a5\u00eaB pathway in lung cancer; however, the components linking KRAS to NF-\u00a5\u00eaB are not clear. The signaling adaptor p62 (also known as sequestosome) was recently identified as a critical target of RAS-induced mouse lung adenocarcinomas and NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation and as necessary for survival of human lung adenocarcinomas (17). It was shown that p62 activates I\u00a5\u00eaB kinase (IKK), the central component of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB, through TRAF6 autoubiquitination. Despite the requirement of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB in tumor development and RAS signaling, the essential role of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB in KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinomas was not revealed until recently. Genetic inhibition of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB showed that NF-\u00a5\u00eaB is critical to the development of mouse lung adenocarcinomas driven by the KRAS G12D mutation (2). In an independent finding, a systematic RNAi screen revealed that KRAS-driven lung cancers require TBK1 and c-REL, 2 components of the NF-\u00a5\u00eaB signaling cascade (16). Taken together, these observations suggest that the role of TRAF6 in lung cancer may be as a mediator of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation. TRAF6 activates the NF-\u00a5\u00eaB pathway by sequential steps, including K63-linked autoubiquitination at N-terminal lysines, followed by ubiquitination of TAK1 and IKK-\u00a5\u00e3 (also known as NEMO). Interestingly, the TRAF6 deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD) is found mutated in cylindromatosis malignancies and multiple myeloma (20?22). These mutations result in an inability of CYLD to deubiquitinate TRAF6 (23). Consistent with the role of TRAF6 in lung cancer, downregulation of CYLD expression is associated with the development of lung adenocarcinomas (24). Although auto\u00a1\u00a9ubiquitination is important for full TRAF6 activation, some evidence suggests that TRAF6 can activate NF-\u00a5\u00eaB and MAPK in response to IL-1 and RANKL independent of its autoubiquitination ability (25). In our recent study, overexpression of TRAF6 in primary mouse marrow cells results in a myelodysplastic syndrome that develops into a fatal acute myeloid leukemia (26). TRAF6 protein levels are also higher in myelodysplastic syndrome patients (26). Beroukhim et al. also reported amplification of the TRAF6 locus as a somatic and frequent event in several human cancer types (19). Despite these findings, the precise role of TRAF proteins in cancer has not been extensively investigated. Empirical differences in TRAF protein expression in human cancer have been reported (27). TRAF2 and TRAF6, which share many structural and functional similarities, exhibit the highest and most consistent expression in human cancer cell lines (27). TRAF2 has previously been implicated in pancreatic cancers. It is overexpressed in pancreatic tumors and cell lines, activates NF-\u00a5\u00eaB, promotes invasiveness, and protects tumor cells from CD95-mediated apoptosis (28). Interestingly, amplification of the TRAF2 locus (9q34.3; 138,900,786?138,940,887 bp) was another common event in our set of lung cancers (~40% incidence; data not shown), and inhibition of TRAF2 suppresses growth and radiosensitizes lung cancer (29). Amplification and overexpression of TRAF2 may constitute a mechanism of NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation and tumor formation in lung cancers similar to that of TRAF6. We demonstrate that TRAF6 is one of the amplified candidate oncogenes on chromosome 11p13 and likely contributes to the pathogenesis of human lung cancer. Although other candidate genes may reside on 11p13, inhibition of TRAF6 reduced NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation and suppressed tumor growth of human lung cancers harboring 11p13 amplifications, which suggests that it is important for tumorigenesis. Not only were lung cancer samples with 11p13 amplifications dependent on TRAF6 for their malignant state, but lung cancer samples with KRAS mutations (but normal TRAF6 expression) were sensitive to TRAF6 inhibition. Therefore, TRAF6 amplification in lung tumors ? with or without RAS mutations ? may explain constitutive NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation in a majority of lung cancers. We also reported, for the first time to our knowledge, that overexpression of TRAF6 led to malignant transformation and tumor formation, implicating TRAF6 as a bona fide oncogene. Methods. Sample collection, cell lines, and plasmids.. Cancer-derived cell lines were collected as previously described (7). All lung cell lines used in this study and their characteristics are listed in Supplemental Table 2. Mutation data for the lung cancer cell lines were obtained from the Sanger Institute\u00a1\u00afs Cancer Cell Line Project website ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/CellLines/). 261 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, or fresh-frozen tissue tumor specimens were collected from Vancouver General Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital following approval by the Institutional Research Ethics Boards. Hematoxylin and eosin?stained sections for each sample were graded by a lung pathologist for use in selecting regions for manual microdissection to ensure greater than 70% tumor cell content. DNA for cell lines and tumors was isolated using standard procedures, with proteinase K digestion followed by phenolchloroform extraction as previously described (7). Spontaneously immortalized Traf6 ?/? and Traf6 +/+ MEFs were provided by T. Mak and W.C. Yeh (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). H1395 and H520 are diploid at the TRAF6 locus (11p13), contain wild-type KRAS alleles, and are not reported to have a RAS gene expression signature. H460 and H2347 are diploid at the TRAF6 locus and contain a mutant KRAS (Q61H) allele, but are reported to have a RAS signature. HCC95 and SK-MES-1 contain wild-type KRAS alleles, but harbor an amplification of the TRAF6 locus. Although there are no reports on HCC95 gene expression, SK-MES-1 are reported to have a RAS signature. Flag-tagged TRAF6 and T6DN cDNAs were provided by Tularik and cloned into MSCVpac and MSCV-IRES-YFP (MIY). vH-RAS (MSCVpac) was a gift from T. Gilmore (Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA). cDNAs of KRAS activating and inactive KRAS mutants (V12 and N17, respectively) were provided by R. Kay (British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). The pLKO.1 (OpenBiosystems) construct was used to generate shRandom, shT6, shKRAS, shCD44, shTCP11L1, and shCOMMD9. 4 independent pLKO.1-shT6 constructs were obtained: shT6-1 (TRCN0000007348), shT6-2 (TRCN0000007349), shT6-3 (TRCN0000007351), and shT6-4 (TRCN0000007352). Single pLKO.1-sh constructs were obtained for shKRAS (TRCN0000034384), shCD44 (TRCN0000057563), shTCP11L1 (TRCN0000200624), and shCOMMD9 (V2LHS254179). Whole-genome tiling path aCGH and data analysis.. DNA copy number profiles were generated for each sample using whole-genome tiling path aCGH (30). Details of the genomic array, DNA extraction, labeling and hybridization, image analysis, and normalization have been described previously (30, 31). SIGMA 2 software was used to visualize all data as log 2 ratio plots (32). All probes were mapped to March 2006 (hg18) genomic coordinates. All raw array data files are available through the System for Integrative Genomic Microarray Analysis (SIGMA; http://sigma.bccrc.ca) (32) and have been deposited in GEO (accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE31800\",\"term_id\":\"31800\"}}GSE31800). aCGH-Smooth (33) was used to smooth ratio values and identify copy number breakpoints for each sample as previously described (7). The resulting segments and ratio values were then analyzed using the GISTIC method (8) to determine regions of significant amplification and deletion across the samples. Analysis was performed using Gene Pattern software ( www.broad.mit.edu/cancer/software/genepattern/) with default settings. aCGH-Smooth segments less than 2 probes in length were removed prior to analysis. In addition, known regions of copy number variation in the normal population (34) were removed during the analysis. Segments displaying an average log 2 ratio greater than 0.8 for a region were considered to have high-level amplification (7), and thus used as the GISTIC log 2 ratio threshold. The frequency of TRAF6 copy number alteration in tumors and cell lines was performed using aCGH-Smooth ratios, as previously described (35). Sanger Institute\u00a1\u00afs Cancer Cell Line Project ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/CellLines/) was used to investigate whether TRAF6 amplifications exist in human cancer cell lines. Gene expression analysis.. Gene expression data for the lung cancer cell lines were generated using the Affymetrix Gene Chips HG-U133A and HG-U133B and downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE4824\",\"term_id\":\"4824\"}}GSE4824) (36). Fresh-frozen lung tumors were obtained from Vancouver General Hospital as described above. Microdissection of tumor cells was performed, and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kits (Qiagen Inc.). Samples were labeled and hybridized to a custom Affymetrix microarray, containing 43,737 probes mapping to approximately 23,000 unique genes, according to the manufacture\u00a1\u00afs protocols (Affymetrix Inc.) All data were normalized using the Robust Multichip Average algorithm in R (37). Of the lung tumor cohort, only samples with sufficient material for RNA isolation were selected for expression analysis. The Director\u00a1\u00afs Challenge Consortium for the Molecular Classification of Lung Adenocarcinoma was also used to analyze TRAF6 gene expression (38). Integration of genomic and gene expression data.. Gene expression probes were mapped to March 2006 (hg18) genomic coordinates, and those within the peak 11p13 region identified by GISTIC were determined. If multiple probes were present for a gene, the one with the maximum intensity across all samples was used. To integrate gene expression with copy number data, we first separated samples based on their copy number status as previously described (39). Gene expression data were then compared between amplified and neutral copy number groups for each gene using the Mann-Whitney U test to identify those that were overexpressed in the amplified samples with a P value less than 0.05. As the direction of gene expression difference was predicted to match the direction of copy number difference, 1-tailed P values were calculated. A Bonferroni multiple-comparison testing correction was applied based on the total number of gene expression probes analyzed for the region. Probes with an adjusted P value of 0.05 or less were considered significant. Lentiviral infections.. For Rev-dependent lentivirus, HEK293T cells were contransfected with pLKO.1sh, RRE, VSV-G, and REV constructs. Virus was harvested and used to infect human lung cancer cell lines. Transduced cell lines were selected in puromycin. Tumor and soft agar colony-forming studies.. Retrovirally transduced NIH3T3, H1395, H460, HC995, or MEF cells were selected in puromycin for 2 weeks. For colony-forming assays, 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 3 to 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 cells were plated in 10% FBS in DMEM containing 0.3% agar and scored for colonies after approximately 2 weeks, according to published protocol (40). For clones, individual colonies were removed with a 1-ml pipet and transferred to 10% FBS in DMEM in 12-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere and expand prior to reanalysis. Experimental approaches for tumor studies have been published elsewhere (41). Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice were obtained from the Animal Resource Centre of the British Columbia Cancer Research Centre. For tumor implantation, NIH3T3 (2.5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5), H460 (1.5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5), H1395 (2.5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6), or HCC95 (1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6) cells were injected subcutaneously into the dorsa of mice. Tumor length and width were determined using calipers, and tumor volume was calculated as (l \u00a1\u00bf w 2) \u00a1\u00bf 0.5. For each time point, tumor data are presented as the mean tumor volume \u00a1\u00be SEM for the indicated mice. Western blot analysis.. Cultured cells were lysed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and IB with the following antibodies: TRAF6 (sc-7221; Santa Cruz), Tubulin (T-9026; Sigma-Aldrich), actin (sc-1615; Santa Cruz), FLAG (M5; Sigma), RAS (Zymed Laboratories), and ubiquitin (sc-8017; Santa Cruz). IP was performed with anti-TRAF6 antibody (sc-7221; Santa Cruz). Protein expression was quantitated by densitometry. IP.. For RAS overexpression, HEK293 cells were transfected with 4 \u00a5\u00ecg vH-RAS (G12V), KRAS (G12D or N17), or vector control for 2 days. For RAS knockdown, H460 cells were infected with pLKO.1 (control vector) or shKRAS and then selected with puromycin for 10 days. HEK293 or H460 cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X, and protease inhibitor cocktail. TRAF6 or FLAG antibody (2 \u00a5\u00ecg) was added to cell lysates (10 mg) for 3 hours at 4\u00a1\u00c6C and captured by the addition of protein A or G beads for an additional 12 hours at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. The immune complexes were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, followed by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by IB for ubiquitin and TRAF6. Apoptosis analysis.. Approximately 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in Annexin V?binding buffer (10 mM HEPES; 140 mM NaCl; 2.5 mM CaCl 2; pH 7.4) and Annexin V?conjugated antibody (diluted 1:20). After a 15-minute incubation, an additional 500 \u00a5\u00ecl Annexin V?binding buffer was added, and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Proliferation assay.. NIH3T3 cells transduced with vector or TRAF6 were starved overnight in media containing 2% serum, then pulsed with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM BrdU for 0, 1, and 3 hours. As described previously (42), cells were harvested, fixed with 70% ethanol, and analyzed with an anti-BrdU?FITC antibody by flow cytometry. NF-\u00a5\u00eaB activation assays.. For the NF-\u00a5\u00eaB luciferase assays, 300 ng of a \u00a5\u00eaB site-containing luciferase reporter plasmid and 10 ng of thymidine kinase?driven Renilla luciferase were cotransfected into HEK293 cells, NIH3T3 cells, or the indicated lung cancer lines (12-well format) using TransiT transfection reagent (Mirus). Values shown reflect luciferase values normalized to Renilla. For NF-\u00a5\u00eaB translocation, 7 lung cancer cell lines (3 with amplification of 11p13; 4 diploid at 11p13) were cultured in RPM1 (10% FBS). The trypsized cells were washed once in ice-cold buffer A (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8; 10 mM KCl; 1.5 mM MgCl 2). The supernatant was removed, and each pellet was resuspended in 375 \u00a5\u00ecl buffer A containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 0.5% NP-40 (Sigma-Aldrich). The lysate samples were allowed to sit on ice for 10 minutes before they were subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. The supernatant, which was the cytoplasmic fraction, was transferred to new mirocentrifuge tubes while each of the pellets was washed once with 375 \u00a5\u00ecl buffer A. After centrifugation and removal of supernatant, each pellet was solubilized with 75 \u00a5\u00ecl RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail through incubation at 4\u00a1\u00c6C for 20 minutes on a rotator. The nuclear lysate was centrifuged at maximum speed at 4\u00a1\u00c6C for 15 minutes, and the supernatant was transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes as nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts were then analyzed for NF-\u00a5\u00eaB (anti-p65) and PARP1 (anti-Parp1) expression. Preparation of cDNA and RT-PCR of mRNA.. Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The purified total RNA preparation was used as a template to generate first-strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScriptII (Invitrogen). Statistics.. Results are mean \u00a1\u00be SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using Student\u00a1\u00afs t test (1-tailed unless otherwise specified; P < 0.05 considered significant) and Mann-Whitney U test (gene expression data). Comparison of survival between different groups was done by the Kaplan-Meier test, and P value was calculated by the log-rank test. In box-and-whisker plots, bounds of the boxes denote 25th and 75th percentiles; lines within the boxes denote the 50th percentile (median); and whiskers denote range. GraphPad Prism (version 4; GraphPad) was used for statistical analysis. Study approval.. Studies using human material were approved by the University of British Columbia?British Columbia Cancer Agency Research Ethics Board (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Written consent was obtained from all subjects. All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada).

                "text": "Multiple Mutations and Bypass Mechanisms Can Contribute to Development of Acquired Resistance to MET Inhibitors\tTherapies targeting receptor tyrosine kinases have shown efficacy in molecularly defined subsets of cancers. Unfortunately, cancers invariably develop resistance, and overcoming or preventing resistance will ultimately be key to unleashing their full therapeutic potential. In this study, we examined how cancers become resistant to MET inhibitors, a class of drugs currently under clinical development. We utilized the highly sensitive gastric carcinoma cell line, SNU638, and two related MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF-2341066. To our surprise, we observed at least two mechanisms of resistance that arose simultaneously. Both resulted in maintenance of downstream PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-AKT and MEK (MAP/ERK kinase)-ERK signaling in the presence of inhibitor. One mechanism, observed by modeling resistance both in vitro and in vivo, involved the acquisition of a mutation in the MET activation loop (Y1230). Structural analysis indicates that this mutation destabilizes the autoinhibitory conformation of MET and abrogates an important aromatic stacking interaction with the inhibitor. The other cause of resistance was activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway due to increased expression of transforming growth factor \u00a5\u00e1. Activation of EGFR bypassed the need for MET signaling to activate downstream signaling in these cells. This resistance could be overcome by combined EGFR and MET inhibition. Thus, therapeutic strategies that combine MET inhibitors capable of inhibiting Y1230 mutant MET in combination with anti-EGFR?based therapies may enhance clinical benefit for patients with MET-addicted cancers. Importantly, these results also underscore the notion that a single cancer can simultaneously develop resistance induced by several mechanisms and highlight the daunting challenges associated with preventing or overcoming resistance. Introduction. The emerging impact of targeted therapies as cancer treatments is promoting a paradigm shift in the field of oncology. Concomitant with the exciting progress in this field is the realization that the benefits associated with many of these therapies, although pronounced, are temporary. The emergence of resistance has limited the effectiveness of these therapies, and this observation has spurred efforts to understand how cancers become resistant to targeted therapies. The understanding of how resistance emerges should enable us to develop strategies to overcome or prevent resistance, thereby unleashing a greater therapeutic benefit for our patients. In the field of acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors, 2 major kinds of resistance mechanisms have begun to emerge: (i) mutations in the target kinase itself that abrogate the inhibitory action of the drug [e.g., T790M in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and T315I in ABL] or (ii) activation of other signaling events that bypass the continued requirement for the original target (reviewed in refs. 1, 2). MET is the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) for hepatocyte growth factors (HGF), also called scatter factors (SF; refs. 3, 4). Although MET has been implicated in the metastases and migration of cancer cells (5, 6), recent studies have revealed that a subset of cancers are \"addicted\" to MET signaling. Such cancers include gastric carcinomas that harbor amplification of the MET oncogenes (7). In these cancers, MET inhibition dramatically reduces cell viability and invariably leads to down-regulation of the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-AKT and MEK (MAP/ERK kinase)-ERK signaling pathways (7, 8). In addition, MET activation, via amplification or with a ligand, has been identified as an acquired resistance mechanism to EGFR inhibitors in EGFR mutant non?small cell lung cancers (8?11). In these cancers, concomitant inhibition of MET and EGFR leads to marked reduction of cell viability both in vitro and in vivo (8?11). These observations have increased enthusiasm for developing MET inhibitors as cancer therapeutics. Although encouraging clinical data with MET are emerging (12, 13), experience with other RTK inhibitors suggests that resistance will develop even in the subset of cancers that initially derive clinical benefit. In addition, there is also the concern that a single cancer may develop multiple, distinct resistance mechanisms simultaneously. For example, in an autopsy of a lung cancer patient who became resistant to EGFR inhibitors, different resistance mechanisms were observed in distinct metastatic sites (8, 9). Indeed, the prevalence of simultaneous heterogeneous resistance mechanisms remains unknown, as does its potential impact on our ability to reinduce remissions. In this study, we have examined how cancers can become resistant to MET inhibitors. We examined resistance with the highly sensitive gastric carcinoma cell line SNU638. Acquired resistance was modeled in vitro and in vivo to 2 related MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF-2341066 (crizotinib). (crizotinib). Surprisingly, we observed that the single cell line, SNU638, simultaneously developed 2 distinct mechanisms to maintain downstream signals for cell survival. Materials and Methods. Cell lines and reagents. The SNU638 cell line was characterized previously (8). The cell lines MKN45 and EBC-1 were provided by Dr. Jeffrey Settleman (Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Both cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine (Cellgro; Mediatech Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 units/mL streptomycin. PHA-665752 and PF-2341066 were obtained from Tocris and ChemieTek, respectively, and PF-00299804 was provided by Pfizer. Stock solutions were prepared in DMSO and stored at ?20\u00a1\u00c6C. Antibodies against ERBB3 and AKT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); p85 and GAB2 (Millipore); GAPDH (Chemicon); and actin (Sigma) were used per manufacturer's directions. All other antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. The human phospho-RTK array kit, human transforming growth factor \u00a5\u00e1 (TGF\u00a5\u00e1) immunoassay, and recombinant human TGF\u00a5\u00e1 were purchased from R&D Systems. ShRNA and lentiviral infection. MET, ERBB3, and scrambled [(scRNA) control] short hairpin RNA (shRNA) contructs were described previously (8). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot. Cells were treated with PHA-667572 for 6 hours and then lysed using lysis buffer (20 mmol/L Tris, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Coimmunoprecipitations with the PI3K regular subunit p85 were carried out as previously described (14). Xenograft studies. Nude mice (nu/nu; 6?8 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories) were carried out in accordance with the standards of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Massachusetts General Hospital. Mice were anesthetized by 2% isofluorane (Baxter) mixed with oxygen and innoculated with 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 SNU638 cells (in 0.2 mL PBS) subcutaneously into the lower left side of quadrant. Once the tumor size was ~500 mm 3, the mice were treated with either PF-2341066 (25 mg/kg/d) or vehicle by oral gavage. Mouse weight and tumor size were measured 3 times per week. Results. Resistant clones maintain PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and TORC1 signaling in the presence of MET inhibitors. SNU638 is a gastric carcinoma cell line that is addicted to MET signaling and thus highly sensitive to MET inhibitors (Fig. 1A; ref. 8). Not surprisingly, it expresses MET to levels comparable with cells harboring MET amplification (e.g., EBC1, HCC827 GR5, H1993; refs. 8, 15; Supplementary Fig. S1). We grew SNU638 cells in increasing concentrations of the PHA-665752 until cells were able to grow in medium containing 1 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L PHA-665752, a dose previously shown to potently inhibit MET signaling and markedly decrease cell viability in cancers addicted to MET signaling but is not toxic to MET-independent lines (7, 8, 11). Subclones (A1, A2, A3, C1, C2, and B1) derived from single cells of the resistant cell line showed marked resistance (Fig. 1A). Clones A1 and C1 were utilized for further analyses. To determine whether the resistant clones had aberrant activation of RTKs, we assessed the activation status of multiple RTKs with human phospho-RTK arrays. In contrast to the parental sensitive cell line, the A1-resistant cells maintained MET and EGFR phosphorylation in the presence of PHA-665752. The C1 cells maintained only EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 1B and C). In addition, unlike the parental sensitive cell line, drug treatment failed to substantially downregulate pAKT, pERK, or pS6 in either of the resistant clones (Fig. 1C). TGF\u00a5\u00e1-dependent activation of EGFR induces resistance. To determine how EGFR was being activated in the C1-resistant cells, we measured the expression levels of the EGFR ligands by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Of all the growth factors tested (including EGF, TGF\u00a5\u00e1, amphiregulin, betacellulin, HB-EGF, and epiregulin), only TGF\u00a5\u00e1 RNA levels were dramatically increased (~13\u00a1\u00bf; Fig. 2A, left, and Supplementary Fig. S2). There was also marked elevation of TGF\u00a5\u00e1 protein in the supernatant of resistant cells (Fig. 2A, right). To determine whether TGF\u00a5\u00e1 is sufficient to promote resistance, we added recombinant TGF\u00a5\u00e1 to parental SNU638 and MKN45 cells (an independent MET-addicted cancer cell line). We observed that exogenous TGF\u00a5\u00e1 was indeed sufficient to promote marked resistance to MET inhibition, but resistance was overcome by combined inhibition of MET and EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Although neither single-agent MET inhibitors nor single-agent EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib or PF-00299804) substantially blocked EGFR phosphorylation in C1 cells, combined EGFR and MET inhibition was more effective (Fig. 2B), suggesting that EGFR phosphorylation is due to both cross-talk with MET and TGF\u00a5\u00e1-induced activation. Interestingly, EGFR inhibitors alone diminished ERK and S6 phosphorylation, but not AKT phosphorylation, in C1 cells, suggesting that these cells undergo a \"rewiring\" in which EGFR signaling is the primary, independent driver of the ERK pathway. These findings were consistent with the observation that exogenous TGF\u00a5\u00e1 maintained phosphorylation of ERK and S6 in SNU638 and MKN45 cells treated with PHA-665752 but had only a modest effect on AKT phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Although EGFR inhibition alone had a moderate impact on C1 cell viability (possibly due to its regulation of ERK; Supplementary Fig. S4), EGFR inhibition potently resensitized the cells to the effects of MET inhibition and overcame resistance (Fig. 2C, top). Somatic MET Y1230H mutation results in drug resistance in A1 cells. Unlike the C1-resistant clone, the A1-resistant clone was not sensitive to combined EGFR and MET inhibition (Fig. 2C, bottom). Furthermore, they were resistant to 2 independent MET inhibitors, PHA-665752 (IC 50 = 1.72 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L vs. 13.2 nmol/L parental cells) and PF-2341066 (IC 50 = 1.66 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L vs. 2.42 nmol/L parental cells; Fig. 3A). Of note, the previous phospho-RTK arrays and Western blots revealed that a small amount of MET tyrosine phosphorylation persisted despite MET inhibitor treatment (Fig. 1B and C). Sequencing of the MET gene revealed the presence of a new mutation in the resistant cells (Fig. 3B). This mutation resulted in a change from a tyrosine to a histidine unit at position 1,230 (Y1230H). This mutation was further confirmed by sequencing individual bacterial colonies transformed with the MET RT-PCR product from the A1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). This mutation was not detectable in cDNA from parental cells (Fig. 3B). These findings suggested that a mutation in MET may have led to resistance, analogous to resistance mutations observed in EGFR and ABL when cancers become resistant to gefitinib/erlotinib and imatinib, respectively. To determine whether the resistant A1 cells still required MET expression for their resistance, we assessed the effects of MET knockdown on cell viability. Knockdown of MET with 2 independent shRNAs effectively reduced viability of the A1 cells in a manner similar to that of the parental cells, showing their continued dependence on MET expression (Supplementary Fig. S6). In contrast, the C1 cells were not sensitive to MET knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S6). This was anticipated, as the C1 cells were resistant to MET inhibitors due to ligand-dependent activation of EGFR signaling. To confirm that the deleterious effects of MET shRNA on the A1 cells were specifically due to MET knockdown, MET expression was rescued with a lentivirus expressing an MET cDNA resistant to the knockdown induced by one of the shRNA constructs [which targets the 3\u00a1\u00c7 untranslated region (UTR) of MET RNA]. As shown in Fig. 3 C and D, MET expression rescued the cells from the effects of MET shRNA. Furthermore, expression of the MET Y1230H mutant was capable of rescuing the parental cells from the effects of MET knockdown. Thus, the A1 cells are resistant to MET inhibitors but are sensitive to MET knockdown, consistent with the notion that resistance is driven by the newly identified MET mutation that results in incomplete inhibition of the MET kinase activity. In addition, the A1 cells were rescued by wild-type (wt) MET because the A1 cells rely on MET signaling for survival and this could be supplied by wt MET. As expected, wt MET was sufficient to rescue viability, as these experiments were not carried out in the presence of the MET inhibitor. The MET Y1230H mutation is sufficient to cause resistance to MET inhibitors. To determine whether the MET Y1230H mutation is sufficient to cause drug resistance, we overexpressed wt MET or MET Y1230H in SNU638 cells (Fig. 4A). Cells expressing MET Y1230H were substantially more resistant to both PHA-665752 and PF-2341066 (Fig. 4B), but the control cells expressing wt MET were still sensitive to MET inhibitors. The cells expressing Y1230H maintained MET phosphorylation as well as downstream signaling in the presence of PHA-665752, indicating that the Y1230H is sufficient to induce resistance to the MET inhibitors. To determine whether MET Y1230H activates PI3K by the same molecular mechanisms as wt MET, we conducted PI3K immunoprecipitations that identify the adaptors leading to PI3K membrane recruitment and activation (8, 14, 16). We found that the parental and MET-overexpressing cells utilized ERBB3 and GAB2, but unlike the control cells and those overexpressing wt MET, the MET Y1230H cells maintained interactions with GAB2 and ERBB3 despite treatment with PHA-665752 (Supplementary Fig. S7A), consistent with the inability of the MET inhibitor to fully inhibit MET and down-regulate PI3K-AKT signaling in these cells (Fig. 4C). Of note, we observed that exogenous expression of the Y1230H mutant was sufficient to induce resistance in two other MET addicted cell lines, EBC1 (non-small cell lung cancer) and MKN45 (gastric; ref. 7; Supplementary Fig. S8). Development of resistant mutations in vivo. We also determined how SNU638 cells developed resistance to MET inhibition in vivo. SNU638 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Once the tumors were ~500 mm 3, PF-2341066 was administered daily by oral gavage. Compared with the control mouse treated with vehicle alone, PF-2341066 resulted in tumor regression for 3 to 4 weeks before resistance developed (Fig. 5A). This resistant tumor was harvested at day 46 of treatment and used for establishing the cell line M1 (Mouse1). We observed that the M1 cells maintained resistance to PHA-665752 and PF-2341066 in vitro (Fig. 5B). MET phosphorylation (as well as intracellular PI3K, ERK, and TORC1 signaling) was maintained in the M1 cells after treatment with 1 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L PHA-665752 (Fig. 5C) similar to the A1 cells described earlier. Furthermore, these cells maintained the association between PI3K and ERBB3 and GAB proteins despite treatment with the MET inhibitor similarly to the cells overexpressing MET Y1230H (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B). Assessment of both the in vivo resistant tumor and the derived M1 cell line identified mutations in Tyr1230 (Fig. 5D) that were not detected in the parental cell line and untreated xenograft tumors. Assessment of single clones of cDNA isolated from the M1 cell lined showed 2 different mutations in Tyr1230 in the resistant cancers Y1230H (TAT \u00a1\u00e6 CAT) and Y1230C (TAT \u00a1\u00e6 TGT). We derived cell lines from single-cell clones from the M1 cell line and assessed 15 of the derived clones. Three clones had no mutations in MET (wt/wt), 9 harbored MET Y1230H mutations, and 3 harbored Y1230C mutations (Fig. 5E). All of the clones harboring mutations in MET maintained resistance to PHA-665752 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S9A). Of interest, clones without mutant MET maintained sensitivity to PHA-665752, suggesting that, in vivo, they may have been resistant via non?cell autonomous mechanisms. Of note, we measured TGF\u00a5\u00e1 by RT-PCR in the resistant xenograft and the derived wt/wt cells, and we did not observe any increase in RNA abundance (Supplementary Fig. S9B and C). However, because most of the cells in the resistant tumor harbored a mutation in Y1230, it is unclear whether substantial increases in TGF\u00a5\u00e1 would be detected in total tumor RNA even if TGF\u00a5\u00e1 were driving resistance in this minor population. Thus, it is possible that stromal interactions may have promoted the viability of those wt/wt cells in vivo. In conclusion, these in vivo studies confirmed that MET Y1230H or Y1230C mutations might be sufficient to cause autonomous drug resistance. Furthermore, these findings show that some of the resistant mechanisms observed in vitro were recapitulated in vivo and that a single cell line has the capacity to give rise to multiple resistance mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. The crystal structure of the MET tyrosine kinase domain bound to PHA-665752 reveals the role of Y1230. A crystal structure of PHA-665752 bound to the kinase domain of MET (PDB entry = 2WKM) was determined. PHA-665752 binds to an autoinhibitory conformation of MET in which the beginning of the kinase activation loop forms a turn that is inserted between \u00a5\u00e1-helix C and the N-terminal domain \u00a5\u00e2-sheet (Fig. 6A). In this conformation, \u00a5\u00e1-helix C is displaced from a catalytically competent orientation and the position of the activation loop prevents the binding of substrates. As bound to MET, the conformation of PHA-665752 is C-shaped, as has been observed for other class I MET inhibitors including PF-2341066 (17, 18). Activation loop residue Tyr1230 makes an aromatic stacking interaction with the dichlorophenyl ring of PHA-665752 (Fig. 6B). Tyr1230 also seems to be an important residue in stabilizing the unique activation loop conformation, as its hydroxyl is involved in a hydrogen-bonding network with Ala1226 and the side chain of Lys1110, which is also positioned to hydrogen bond with Asp1228. One explanation for the diminished inhibitory activity of PHA-665752 toward the Y1230H mutant MET is that the substitution of histidine for tyrosine at residue 1,230 results in decreased binding of PHA-665752 because of a weaker stacking interaction of the smaller histidine imidazole ring (vs. the tyrosine phenol) with the dichlorophenyl ring of PHA-665752 (Fig. 6B). Loss of direct favorable interactions with PHA-665752 and other class I inhibitors may be even greater for the Y1230C mutation than for the Y1230H mutation due to the nonaromaticity and smaller size of the sulfydryl side chain. Another contributing factor to the inhibitor resistance of the Y1230H/C mutations may be that the substitutions at position 1,230 destabilize the autoinhibitory conformation of the activation loop and change the protein conformational equilibrium in the direction of a catalytically active conformation. Modeling of histidine or cysteine at position 1,230 reveal that they would not be able to form the same stabilizing hydrogen bonding network observed with Tyr1230 (Fig. 6B). Loss of this hydrogen bonding network as well as the impact of the smaller side chains not completely filling the space of the tyrosine likely destabilize the autoinhibitory conformation. It is therefore likely that acquired resistance mutations at position 1,230 may also be discovered with other class I MET inhibitors that bind to this autoinhibitory conformation of MET and make a direct interaction with Tyr1230. Discussion. The deflating realization that cancers become resistant to effective targeted therapies has spurred great interest in determining how cancers become resistant so that we can identify more effective strategies to induce more durable remissions. In this study, we examined resistance to MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). To our surprise, using a single cell line, SNU638, we observed multiple mechanisms by which these cells became resistant to MET inhibitors. Some clones became resistant by activating the EGFR through autocrine production of ligand, whereas other clones acquired novel mutations in amino acid 1,230 that conferred resistance. These results were recapitulated by developing resistance models in vivo as well. The finding that a single plate of 1 million cells and a small subcentimeter tumor in vivo can simultaneously develop multiple mechanisms of resistance highlights the notion that patients with cancers consisting of billions to trillions of cells have the capacity to simultaneously develop a wide array of resistance mechanisms. This will continue to challenge our capacity to strategically reinduce remissions. Resistance to other targeted therapies including EGFR and ABL inhibitors has been associated with the development of secondary mutations that abrogate TKI inhibition. The most common mutation that develops after treatment with EGFR kinase inhibitors is EGFR T790M (19, 20), and a common one after treatment with imatinib is ABL T315I (21?23). Both mutations are located in an analogous position in the kinase domain and have been termed \"gatekeeper\" mutations. In this study, we identified mutations in Y1230 as an acquired resistance mechanism to class I MET inhibitors. The occasional existence of MET Y1230 mutations in pretreatment cancers (24) is analogous to the observations that some lung cancers and leukemias harbor EGFR T790M and ABL T315I, respectively, prior to treatment (25, 26). In the case of MET, this is likely related because of increased MET activity conferred by the Y1230 mutation. Indeed, the structural analyses (Fig. 6) suggest that mutation destabilizes the autoinhibitory confirmation. This is supported by the finding that MET Y1230H has increased catalytic activity in vitro (18) and has transforming activity in vivo (27). The MET Y1230H mutation is located in the activation loop of the enzyme. Structural analyses suggest that the substitution of Y1230 with histidine or cysteine has a lower affinity with PF-2341066 and PHA-665752. Indeed, these results are supported by previous in vitro kinase assays showing that these compounds have decreased inhibitory activity toward MET Y1230H as compared with wt MET in enzymatic and cellular assays (18). Although these and other class I MET inhibitors seem to have decreased activity against MET Y1230H (28), there have recently been reports of class II MET inhibitors that can potently inhibit Y1230H (29, 30). Theoretically, such inhibitors will effectively treat these Y1230 mutant resistant cancers. Moreover, these inhibitors might prevent the acquisition of Y1230 mutations as a resistant mechanism. Recent studies suggest that \"pulse dosing\" may permit one to overcome resistance and effectively treat oncogene-addicted cancers with targeted therapies (31). Indeed, we observed that very high levels of PF-2341066 (10 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L) could potently suppress MET in Y1230 mutant cells (Supplementary Fig. S10A). Although this dose was capable of inhibiting growth of SNU638 parental cells after only 1 hour of exposure, the resistant M1 cells required 24 hours of high-dose exposure (Supplementary Fig. S10B). Of note, previous studies found that mice could tolerate 50 mg/kg dosage level and plasma levels achieved concentrations of 2 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L (32). Although it remains unknown if mice, or more important, humans, could tolerate doses required to provide sufficient target inhibition of Y1230 mutants, the marked decrease in potency against the resistant mutant (300- to 1,000-fold) suggests that newer MET inhibitors that can effectively target Y1230H may ultimately be a more effective clinical strategy. In addition, we observed that activation of EGFR induced resistance to MET inhibitors. Of note, we had previously observed the reciprocal finding that MET activation is one mechanism of resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancers treated with EGFR TKIs (8, 11). In this study, we found that SNU638 cells adapt to MET inhibition by overexpressing the EGFR ligand TGF\u00a5\u00e1 to promote resistance. Similarly, another study showed that exogenous addition of other growth factors (EGF and heregulin) rescued MET-driven cells (GTL-16 and MKN45) from MET inhibition (33); however, that report did not identify upregulation of ligand as a naturally occurring resistance mechanism. Both the C1-resistant cells and the cells treated with exogenous TGF\u00a5\u00e1 show that ligand-dependent activation of EGFR strongly maintained ERK signaling, but its effects on PI3K signaling were more modest. Importantly, EGFR inhibition resensitized these cells to MET inhibition. Because tumor stroma can secrete TGF\u00a5\u00e1 in vivo, cancers may acquire resistance by autocrine- or paracrine-derived sources. In addition to SNU638 cell line, we also aimed to determine how other MET-addicted cancer models would develop resistance. We recently developed resistant clones from EBC1 cells in vitro (designated 1A, 7A, and 4B) by the same procedure that generated the SNU638-resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S11A). These resistant clones do not seem to share the same resistance mechanisms identified in the SNU638 cells. Unlike the C1 cells, they were not sensitive to PHA-665752 plus gefitinib combination treatment (Supplementary Fig. S11B). There were also no observed resistant mutations in the kinase domain (Supplementary Fig. S11C), MET phosphorylation was fully suppressed by MET inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S11D), and they were insensitive to MET knockdown by MET shRNA (Supplementary Fig. S11E). Although the mechanism is unknown, these studies do reveal that there will be additional mechanisms of acquired resistance to MET inhibitors. However, the Y1230H/C point mutations identified in the SNU638 cells may ultimately prove to be a highly prevalent resistance mechanism to class I MET inhibitors. Indeed, acquired point mutations in drug targets have been a commonly observed resistance mechanism in other targeted therapy paradigms as well (e.g., EGFR T790M and ABL T315I). In summary, our data suggest that even a single cell line in vitro can develop more than one type of mechanism to become drug resistant. Indeed, we find evidence of both acquired mutations in MET and the upregulation of EGFR ligand to promote resistance. As cancers become resistant to the \"C-shaped\" MET inhibitors in the clinic, it will be important to assess for these resistance mechanisms in patients. Indeed, the therapeutic strategies that combine MET inhibitors capable of inhibiting Y1230 mutant MET in combination with anti-EGFR?based therapies may translate into enhanced clinical benefit for patients.

                "text": "Glutamatergic Pathway Targeting in Melanoma; Single Agent and Combinatorial Therapies\tPurpose. Melanoma is a heterogeneous disease where monotherapies are likely to fail due to variations in genomic signatures. B-RAF inhibitors have been clinically inadequate but response might be augmented with combination therapies targeting multiple signaling pathways. We investigate the pre-clinical efficacy of combining the multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib or mutated B-RAF inhibitor PLX4720 with Riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release that antagonizes GRM1 (metabotropic glutamate receptor1) signaling in melanoma cells. Experimental Design. Melanoma cell lines that express GRM1 and either wild type B-RAF or mutated B-RAF were treated with Riluzole, Sorafenib, PLX4720 or the combination of Riluzole with Sorafenib or with PLX4720. Extra-cellular glutamate levels were determined by glutamate release assays. MTT assays and cell cycle analysis demonstrate effects of the compounds on proliferation, viability and cell cycle profiles. Western immunoblots and immunohistochemical staining showed apoptotic markers. Consequences on MAPK pathway were assessed by western immunoblots. Xenograft tumor models were used to determine the efficacy of the compounds in vivo. Results. The combination of Riluzole with Sorafenib exhibited enhanced anti-tumor activities in GRM1 expressing melanoma cells harboring either wild type or mutated B-RAF. The combination of Riluzole with PLX4720 showed lessened efficacy compared with the Riluzole and Sorafenib combination in suppressing the growth of GRM1 expressing cells harboring the B-RAF V600E mutation. Conclusions. The combination of Riluzole with Sorafenib appears potent in suppressing tumor proliferation in vitro and in vivo in GRM1 expressing melanoma cells regardless of B-RAF genotype and may be a viable therapeutic clinical combination. INTRODUCTION. The incidence of melanoma has risen rapidly in the past three decades and has become a significant health risk in the United States (1). The treatment of early stage melanoma is surgical resection, with over 85% of patients in the early stages of disease experiencing long-term survival. However, when melanoma metastasizes the prognosis is poor, with few patients diagnosed with stage IV disease surviving past five years (2). Standard cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens have failed to alter the outcome in patients with advanced disease (3) and only the use of biological therapies based on interleukin-2 (IL-2) demonstrate any effect in extending long-term survival (4). Over the past decade, our understanding of the genetic alterations that lead to melanomagenesis and melanoma progression has advanced rapidly. Key signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis and progression of melanoma, including the MAPK, PI3K/AKT, Wnt, JNK, TGF-\u00a5\u00e2, NF\u00a5\u00eaB, and others (5?7) suggest a molecularly complex and heterogeneous disease. Our group has added to the understanding of aberrant signaling in melanoma by discovering that the ectopic expression of a G-protein-couple-receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1) in melanocytes was sufficient to induce spontaneous melanoma development in vivo with 100% penetrance (8). We also confirmed ectopic expression of GRM1 in a subset of human melanoma cell lines and biopsies (8). To date, we have examined over 175 human melanoma biopsies as well as 25 human melanoma cell lines and found that 80% of the cell lines and over 60% of the human biopsies test positive for expression of the receptor at the level of both RNA and protein (9), suggesting that GRM1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of a significant subset of human melanomas. Our work has recently been confirmed by a report demonstrating that transgenic mice with conditional expression of GRM1 in melanocytes developed pigmented lesions at 29 weeks after activation of the transgene with the incidence of subsequent melanoma being 100% at 52 weeks (10). We have worked to unravel the causes and consequences of GRM1 signaling in this disease (9) as well as design therapeutic interventions that target GRM1-signaling. Earlier, we reported in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical findings using human melanoma cell lines that are wild type in B-RAF and N-RAS (C8161) or contain an N-RAS Q61R mutation (WM239A). We demonstrated that MAPK signaling is critical in GRM1-mediated oncogenesis (9) and have also shown that activation of the receptor using known GRM1 agonists results in an up-regulation of the activated (phosphorylated) form of ERK (9). In addition, the majority of GRM1-expressing human melanoma cell lines tested exhibited elevated levels of extra-cellular glutamate which promotes growth by activation of a glutamate autocrine loop. Suppression of GRM1 signaling by either GRM1-antagonists or a reduction in the levels of GRM1 ligand, glutamate, with a glutamate release inhibitor Riluzole, resulted in decreased cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo (9). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Riluzole, is a member of the benzothiazole class of compounds and acts as an inhibitor of glutamate release for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The ability of Riluzole to block the release of the ligand (glutamate) for GRM1 allows it to act functionally as a putative antagonist and interfere with intracellular events that follow stimulation of this receptor. With a low toxicity profile (11, 12), Riluzole was deemed an excellent compound to use in preliminary studies on the effects of glutamate signaling inhibition on melanoma cells (9). To date, the reported modes of actions of Riluzole in humans are inhibition of glutamate release, inactivation of voltage-dependent Na + channels, and interference with G-protein dependent signaling (11). In melanoma cells expressing GRM1, Riluzole has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo (9) as well as migration and invasion (13). Recently, a Phase 0 clinical trial of Riluzole in patients with advanced melanoma was conducted with 34% of patients given Riluzole showing measurable clinical responses. Some tumors decreased in size by over 90% and exhibited suppression of MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in post-treatment tumor samples (14). A recently completed Phase II trial showed no RECIST criteria responses, however, 42% of the patients exhibited stable disease suggesting that Riluzole has overall modest anti-tumor activity whose potential could be realized by combination with other anti-cancer agents (15). As we continue with studies that target GRM1 signaling in melanoma, it is important to perform pre-clinical studies using potential therapeutic agents that reflect the genetic diversity of this disease. Mutations in B-RAF have been identified in 8% of all cancers including over 50% of melanomas (16). Most of these mutations are due to the substitution of a single amino acid at residue 600 in the B-RAF kinase domain resulting in constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway (16). The small-molecule, multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib (17) has proven to be ineffective against melanoma as a single agent but its use in combinatorial therapies may prove more effective in the clinic. A recently described specific small molecule inhibitor specific to B-RAF kinase, PLX4720/PLX4032, was shown to have potent anti-melanoma activity in pre-clinical and clinical studies (18?20). However, its effectiveness has been hampered by the acquirement of drug resistance mechanisms including involvement of other RAF isoforms (21?24). Given the high incidences of B-RAF V600E mutations and GRM1 expression in numerous melanomas, we investigate cellular responses for the combination of a RAF inhibitor with Riluzole, the putative antagonist of GRM1 signaling. Here, we provide data that demonstrates that combining inhibitors of RAF and GRM1 results in the suppression of human melanoma cell growth in vitro as well as tumorigenicity in vivo, suggesting that such a combinational therapy may be superior than either modality alone in melanoma patients. The following report describes in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical experiments using GRM1 expressing human melanoma cell lines that harbor the most common mutation B-RAF V600E, found in human melanomas. We demonstrate that the combination of Riluzole with Sorafenib appears potent in suppressing cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo in GRM1 expressing cells regardless of B-RAF status and may be a viable therapeutic clinical combination. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Antibodies and Reagents. Antibodies against activated Caspase 3, Ki67, PARP, phospho- and total ERK, cleaved PARP, and Mcl-1 were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); antibody for \u00a5\u00e1-tubulin, MTT cell viability assay solution 1 (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), iodonitrotetrazolium chloride, Riluzole was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO); Sorafenib (LC labs, Woburn, MA) and PLX4720 was a gift from Plexxikon Inc., Berkeley, CA. Cell Lines. UACC903 and UACC930 cells were provided by Dr. Jeffery Trent (The Translational Genomics Research Center, Phoenix, AZ) and 1205Lu cells were provided by Dr. Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). C8161 cells were provided by Dr. Mary Hendrix (Children\u00a1\u00afsMemorial Research Center, Chicago, IL). SKMEL2, SKMEL 187 and A2058 cells were purchased from ATCC. The cells were maintained in RPMI plus 10% FBS. Human epidermal melanocytes (HEM) were maintained in medium 254 (Invitrogen) supplemented with human melanocyte growth supplement (Invitrogen). Human epithelial kidney cells (HEK) were maintained in DMEM plus 10% FBS. MTT Assays, Cell Cycle Analysis and Glutamate release. MTT cell viability assays were performed as previously described (9). C8161, UACC903, 1205Lu, SKMEL 187 and A2058 melanoma cell lines were used in the MTT assays. Each cell line was cultured in 96 well plates (10 3 cells/well) with the following conditions: no treatment, vehicle alone (DMSO), Riluzole (1\u00a5\u00ecM, 5\u00a5\u00ecM, 10\u00a5\u00ecM, 25\u00a5\u00ecM, or 50\u00a5\u00ecM), Sorafenib (1\u00a5\u00ecM, 3\u00a5\u00ecM, 5\u00a5\u00ecM, or 7\u00a5\u00ecM), or the combination of Riluzole (10\u00a5\u00ecM) and Sorafenib (5\u00a5\u00ecM), PLX4720 (0.01\u00a5\u00ecM, 0.05\u00a5\u00ecM, 0.1\u00a5\u00ecM, or 0.3\u00a5\u00ecM) or the combination of Riluzole (10\u00a5\u00ecM) plus PLX4720 (0.05\u00a5\u00ecM). Viable cells were measured every day for 4 or 7 days. For cell cycle analysis, UACC903, 1205Lu, and A2058 melanoma cell lines were used. Cell cycle analysis was performed at 24 and 48 hours of incubation of the cell lines in monolayer culture with no treatment, vehicle alone (DMSO), or 10\u00a5\u00ecM Riluzole. Cells were harvested at each time point and examined using propidium iodide followed by flow cytometry performed by the Flow Cytometry Facility Core at Rutgers University as previously described (9). Amplex Red Glutamic Acid/Glutamate Oxidase assay kit (Invitrogen) was used to measure levels of glutamate. Three Dimensional Anchorage Independent Assays. We performed three-dimensional colony assays using C8161, UACC903, SKMEL2 and 1205Lu human melanoma cell lines in the presence of vehicle (DMSO), Riluzole (10\u00a5\u00ecM), Sorafenib (5\u00a5\u00ecM), or the combination of Riluzole (10\u00a5\u00ecM) and Sorafenib (5\u00a5\u00ecM). The cells were suspended in 0.35% agar in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and plated on a layer of 0.75% agar in the same medium in 12-well culture plates (1 ? 1.5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 cells/well). Vehicle, Riluzole alone, Sorafenib alone, or Riluzole and Sorafenib, were added in the agar underlay, as well as to the cells suspended in agar on day 1. Every other day, the vehicle, or drug(s) was again added with 250\u00a5\u00ecl of complete medium. After 14 days, the colonies were stained with iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (Sigma) and photographed. The numbers of colonies were counted using Image J software. Quantitation was performed by comparing the total number of colonies from three representative photomicrographs from each experiment. The histograms represent the average of three independent experiments. Western Immunoblots. Protein lysates were prepared as described previously (9). Briefly, media was removed and cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After removal of PBS, the extraction buffer was added directly to the plates and cells were collected with a cell scraper. Cells were incubated on ice for 20 minutes. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 \u00a1\u00bf g at 4\u00a1\u00c6C for 20 minutes and supernatant taken for Western immunoblot analysis. Western Blotting was carried out with anti-PARP, anti-cleaved PARP, anti-phospho ERK, anti-total ERK and anti-\u00a5\u00e1-tubulin antibodies. Xenografts in Immunodeficient Nude Mice. The Institutional Review Board approved all animal studies for the Animal Care and Facilities Committee of Rutgers University. Nude mice were purchased from Taconic (Hudson, NY). Cells were injected into 2 dorsal sites of each mouse at 10 6 cells per site. Tumor size was measured twice a week with a Vernier caliper and calculated as described (9). Once tumor volumes reached 6?10mm 3, mice were divided into no treatment and treatment groups. The treatment groups received either vehicle (DMSO), Riluzole (10mg/kg), Sorafenib (24mg/kg), PLX4720 (20mg/kg), or the combination of Riluzole (5mg/kg) and Sorafenib (12mg/kg) or Riluzole (5mg/kg) and PLX4720 (10mg/kg) by oral gavage daily. The doses of oral Riluzole, Sorafenib, and PLX4720 were based on published reports (11, 12, 20). The experiments were terminated when the xenografts on the no treatment group reached the maximum permitted size. Immunohistochemistry. Tissue Analytical Services at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey performed immunohistochemical staining on excised tumor xenografts to detect changes in the number of apoptotic and proliferating cells (activated Caspase 3 and Ki-67, respectively). RESULTS. The oncogenic transformation of various cell types by ectopic expression of GPCRs is characterized by the development of autocrine and paracrine loops that enhance cellular proliferation (25). Three melanoma cell lines (UACC903, 1205Lu and A2058) containing the activating B-RAF V600E mutation exhibited elevated levels of extra-cellular glutamate similar to that previously described for wild type B-RAF melanoma cells, C8161 and WM239A (9) compared to cells that do not express the receptor or cells that contain a truncated, non-functioning GRM1 receptor, UACC930 melanoma cells (Figure 1A). MTT cell viability assays were performed to rule out that the increase in glutamate observed was not attributable to the cell lysis, establishing that the cells themselves must be excreting glutamate into their surroundings in an attempt to establish autocrine activity (Figure 1B). We next assessed the effects of the glutamate-release inhibitor, Riluzole, on the growth of human melanoma cells in monolayer culture. Standard MTT assays were performed using four GRM1-expressing melanoma cell lines expressing wild type forms of B-RAF and N-RAS (C8161 and SKMEL 187) or B-RAF V600E mutation (UACC903, 1205Lu, and A2058). We found that Riluzole at concentration of 25\u00a5\u00ecM or 50\u00a5\u00ecM significantly decreased the number of viable cells as compared to no treatment or vehicle (DMSO) treated cells (Figure 2A). Melanoma cells harboring a wild type B-RAF (C8161 and SKMEL 187) were found to be much more sensitive to Riluzole than those that contained a mutant copy of B-RAF (1205Lu, UACC903). This is in support of earlier reports that indicated that since both GRM1 and B-RAF V600E stimulate MAPK signaling, one of the key signaling pathways in human melanoma leading to metastasis, abolishing GRM1 signaling alone in cells that bear B-RAF V600E would not abolish over-activated MAPK (9). We next obtained the cell cycle profiles of Riluzole (10\u00a5\u00ecM) treated UACC903, 1205Lu, and A2058 melanoma cells to assess the effects that it had on cell cycle progression over time. All three cell lines yielded very similar results with an example of UACC903 shown. At 24 hours post-treatment about half of the cells were found to accumulate in the G2/M phase. By 48 hours there was a 10?20-fold shift of the cell population to the subG1 phase of the cycle, indicative of apoptotic cell response (Figure 2B). This apoptotic response was confirmed by an increase in the cleaved form of PARP by Western analysis. Control samples showed negligible amounts of cleaved PARP at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 2C). These results were very similar to our previous report demonstrating a similar G2/M cell cycle arrest followed by apoptotic shift in GRM1-expressing human melanoma cell lines harboring wild type B-RAF and N-RAS (C8161) or mutated N-RAS (WM239A) in the presence of Riluzole (9), suggesting that depletion of the ligand (glutamate) to the receptor, GRM1, by Riluzole induces cell cycle arrest and promotes apoptosis in GRM1 positive melanoma cells regardless of B-RAF genotype. To confirm this observation in vivo, we performed xenograft experiments using single agent Riluzole as described (9) (Figure 2D). Briefly, UACC903 cells were injected into the dorsal flanks of nude mice. Tumors were allowed to grow to approximately 6?10mm 3 and mice were divided into groups to obtain relatively constant tumor volumes between each group (12 mice per group). Animals were treated daily with Riluzole or vehicle (DMSO) by oral gavage. At day 18, there was a substantial difference between the tumor sizes of Riluzole-treated animals compared to controls (Figure 2D). Though Riluzole on its own appears effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in melanoma cells harboring activating B-RAF mutations in vivo, it is less effective at doing so than in melanoma xenografts harboring wild type B-RAF (9). Clinically, these observations suggest it is likely that administration of a single agent Riluzole will not be as effective in patients whose melanomas contain a mutated form of B-RAF. Tumors are composed of heterogeneous cell populations. For this reason, we started to explore potential combinatorial therapies that would include Riluzole as one of the components to treat heterogeneous tumor populations in an attempt to slow the progression of this disease. We choose Sorafenib a multi-kinase inhibitor which has been shown to inhibit RAF signaling, and whose toxicity profile is known in vivo (17, 26) and PLX4720, a recently described specific small molecule inhibitor for B-RAF V600E (18?20). We treated three GRM1-expressing human melanoma cell lines (C8161, UACC903 and 1205Lu) with Riluzole, Sorafenib, or a combination of both Riluzole and Sorafenib for seven days and assessed cell proliferation and viability using MTT assays (Figure 3). In the presence of Riluzole alone, C8161 cell line has the highest reduction in the number of viable cells confirming our earlier report (9) (Figure 3A). UACC903 and 1205Lu are also positive for GRM1 expression and harbor a mutated B-RAF (V600E). These cell lines were not as sensitive to Riluzole (Figures 3B and 3C). In the presence of Sorafenib, the opposite responses were observed; UACC903 and 1205Lu displayed a substantial decrease in the number of viable cells in comparison to C8161 cells. A combination of 10\u00a5\u00ecM Riluzole with 5\u00a5\u00ecM Sorafenib led to synergistic, inhibitory effect on the proliferation C8161 cells (Figure 3A), and an additive, inhibitory effect on UACC903 and 1205Lu cells (Figures 3B and 3C) when analyzed as described (27). To assess if combining PLX4720 with Riluzole would also yield the additive effect observed with Sorafenib, we treated UACC903 and C8161 cells with Riluzole, PLX4720 or the combination of both. The IC50 for PLX4720 in UACC903 cells was determined to be 0.1\u00a5\u00ecM (Figure 3B). UACC903 cells treated with a combination of 10uM Riluzole and half the IC50, 0.05uM PLX4720 exhibited additive inhibitory activity when compared to either single agent alone (Figure 3B). As expected wild type B-RAF, GRM1 positive C8161 cells show only slight inhibition in cell proliferation with higher concentrations of PLX4720 (10uM) and no increase in efficacy when combined with Riluzole (data not shown). To further predict the results obtained in two-dimensional assays in a model more closely related to in vivo, we performed three-dimensional, anchorage-independence assays using four GRM1-positive melanoma cell lines: C8161 (wild type B-RAF and N-RAS), UACC903, 1205Lu (mutated B-RAF V600E), and SKMEL2 (mutated N-RAS Q61R). In C8161 cells, we found that Riluzole at 10\u00a5\u00ecM led to a 40% decrease in colony formation while Sorafenib alone had little effect (Figures 4A and 4B). However, the combination of Riluzole and Sorafenib had a substantial consequence resulting in a 70% decrease in colony formation (Figures 4A and 4B). In UACC903 cells, Riluzole alone had very little inhibitory activity while treatment with Sorafenib resulted in a 45% reduction in the number of colonies (Figures 4A and 4B). Furthermore, the combination of Riluzole and Sorafenib led to a drastic 90% decrease in the number of colonies in UACC903 (Figures 4A and 4B). In 1205Lu cells, Riluzole or Sorafenib alone yielded a 30% reduction in colony formation while the combination of both resulted in a 55% decrease in the number of colonies (Figures 4A and 4B). In SKMEL2, Riluzole alone had a modest effect, decreasing colony formation by 18% while Sorafenib was more efficacious at decreasing colony formation. The combination treatment yielded a 62% decrease (Figures 4A and 4B) compared to the control group. These observations further strengthen our hypothesis that a combination of Riluzole and Sorafenib would be able to inhibit tumor cell proliferation more effectively than either agent alone, regardless of the presence or absence of activating mutations in B-RAF or N-RAS in the cells. Given these findings, we performed combinatorial in vivo experiments using C8161, UACC903 and 1205Lu xenografts. In the xenograft studies, all cell lines utilized express GRM1 but differ in B-RAF genotype with C8161 being wild type and UACC903 and 1205Lu containing the activating mutation. In C8161 xenografts, there was a significant decrease in the tumor volumes in animals treated with Riluzole alone confirming our previous report (9). Administration of Sorafenib on its own did not yield a significant decrease in tumor size and the combination of Riluzole with Sorafenib at half the dose used in either one alone yielded a considerable reduction in tumor volume (Figure 5A). In the human melanoma cell lines with mutated B-RAF; UACC903 and 1205Lu, differential responses were detected. UACC903 xenografts demonstrated very similar, statistically relevant responses with Riluzole or Sorafenib alone (Figure 5B). The combination of Riluzole and Sorafenib yielded a higher reduction in tumor volume than either compound alone (Figure 5B). 1205Lu xenografts were found to be more sensitive to Riluzole, Sorafenib or the combination of both reagents when compared to UACC903 xenografts (Figure 5C). It was noted that 1205Lu xenografts were more responsive to the combination therapy than UACC903 xenografts in spite of their common B-RAF V600E genotype indicating that other mutations persistent in these cells must influence their response. Additionally, immunohistochemical analyses were performed on excised xenografts using antibodies against the cleaved form of Caspase 3 to detect apoptotic cell death and Ki-67 to detect changes in cell proliferation. An example of excised UACC903 xenograft tumors is shown. Single agent Riluzole, Sorafenib or the combination of both compounds treated samples showed a substantial increase in the number of positive Caspase 3 cells in comparison to the controls (Figure 5E). Conversely, the number of Ki-67 positive cells was reduced in either single agent or combined treatments (Figure 5F). It is equally important to point out that Riluzole had a more potent effect on C8161 and 1205Lu cell lines despite the disparity in B-RAF status than UACC903. A combination of Riluzole and Sorafenib, though at half the concentration when used alone was effective against all three xenografts (Figures 5A, 5B and 5C). In vivo xenograft studies were also performed to evaluate the efficacy of Riluzole and PLX4720 combination in UACC903 cells. Surprisingly, PLX4720 alone was not as potent as Riluzole (Figure 5D), furthermore, when we combined half the doses of Riluzole and PLX4720 we did not detect further suppression of tumor progression as we observed with similar dosing with Riluzole and Sorafenib combination (compare Figure 5B with Figure 5D). Efficacy of combination Riluzole and PLX4720 against the wild type B-RAF melanoma cell line C8161 was not evaluated with PLX4720 in vivo as it has been shown by others to be ineffective in inducing apoptosis in vitro and in vivo (20) and has also been shown to promote cell growth through activation of the MAPK pathway in a C-RAF dependent manner (28). Pre-clinical and clinical trials performed with Sorafenib, PLX4720 and Riluzole demonstrated a reduction in levels of activated ERK supporting the notion that MAPK is a target for all three compounds (14, 17, 20). We performed Western immunoblots with protein lysates prepared from in vitro cultured cells or excised in vivo xenografts treated with Sorafenib, PLX4720 and Riluzole either alone or in combination as described above. Riluzole inhibits the MAPK pathway as measured by a decrease in levels of ERK phosphorylation in a cell line dependent manner (Figures 6A and 6B). Sorafenib was found to highly suppress ERK phosphorylation in UACC903 and 1205Lu cells than in C8161. The combination was however capable in suppressing ERK phosphorylation in all three cell lines. PLX4720 was only found to suppress ERK activity in the B-RAF V600E cell line UACC903 as a single agent or in combination but not in the C8161 cell line (Figure 6B). Protein lysates obtained with harvested xenografts showed similar results (data not shown). The effect of the combinational drugs on the pro-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, which has been shown to be down-regulated by Sorafenib (29, 30) was investigated as a possible target for additive and synergistic inhibition in tumor growth. A reduction in Mcl-1 levels was detected in Sorafenib treated UACC903 and 1205 LU cells while the combination of Riluzole and Sorafenib led to a reduction in Mcl-1 in all three cells lines (Figure 6C). PLX4720, however, does not down regulate the levels of Mcl-1 either by itself or in combination with Riluzole (Figure 6C). DISCUSSION. Several groups have proposed the concept that the glutamatergic system may play a role in tumor biology and intriguing links between neurodegenerative diseases and cancer have been put forth by several investigators (31, 32). For instance, the incidence of melanoma among patients with ALS or Parkinson\u00a1\u00afs disease is 2?3 times higher than that of the general population in multicenter studies in Australia and North America (33). These observations are in line with earlier reports that elevated levels of extracellular glutamate have been detected in several human disorders including gliomas, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u00a1\u00afs disease, Parkinson and ALS (34, 35), suggesting that the common root of many of these diseases may be glutamate. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (GRMs) are members of the seven-transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family (36). GRMs are divided into three groups based on sequence homology, agonist selectivity, and effecter coupling with all GRMs having glutamate as their natural ligand. GRM1 and GRM5 comprise Group I GRMs and are mainly involved in excitatory responses induced by strong presynaptic stimulation. Group I GRMs are coupled to a G\u00a5\u00e1q-like protein and stimulate phospholipase C beta (PLC\u00a5\u00e2) (37). It has been reported that in melanoma cells GRM1 stimulation results in the activation of PLC\u00a5\u00e2, which in turn converts phosphatidylinositol to two second messengers, inositol triphosphate (IP 3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), which could stimulate both MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways (38, 39). Activation of these two major signaling cascades is central for transformed cell survival, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and angiogenesis (40). Our group described a heretofore-unknown component of melanoma pathogenesis. A transgenic murine model of melanoma was constructed by the ectopic expression of GRM1 in melanocytes (8). These mice spontaneously develop melanocytic lesions very similar to human melanoma. We have expanded these original studies and have now shown that over 60% of human melanomas express the human form of this receptor and that activation of this receptor results in activation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways in a B-RAF and N-RAS-independent fashion (9). The functionality of GRM1 in GRM1-expressing human melanoma cells was demonstrated by the responsiveness of these cells to stimuli and inhibitors of GRM1 (9). Studies by others showed that wild type GPCRs can become tumorigenic when exposed to an excess of locally produced or circulating ligands and agonists (41, 42) while other GPCRs harboring mutations in key conserved residues can have transforming activity even in the absence of their ligands (43). It has also been found that the level of expression of GPCRs is not as important to oncogenesis as the fact that the receptor is expressed (44). Based on these earlier results we assessed levels of GRM1-ligand, glutamate, and we detected elevated glutamate levels in all GRM1-expressing human melanoma cell lines (9). Depletion of glutamate in human melanoma cells was performed using an inhibitor of glutamate release, Riluzole, led to reduced extracellular glutamate level and inhibited the proliferation of GRM1 positive cells, presumably as a result of interfering with autocrine loops through which glutamate exerts its growth promoting abilities. Riluzole, being FDA approved for the treatment of ALS was deemed an excellent compound to use in preliminary studies that could be translated clinically on the effects of glutamate signaling inhibition on melanoma cells (9). The Phase 0 and Phase II clinical trials with Riluzole, which functionally as a putative antagonist of GRM1 signaling has modest anti-tumor activity as a single agent (14, 15). It is possible that activating mutations in B-RAF, or other unidentified genetic factors, affect how GRM1 expressing tumor cells respond to Riluzole therapy since GRM1 signals through other pathways, such as Wnt-\u00a5\u00e2-catenin (45), in addition to the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways (9, 39, 46, 47). We therefore extended our pre-clinical studies to include melanoma cells carrying the most commonly known mutations in B-RAF, (V600E). We found that melanoma cells, which harbor the B-RAF V600E mutation, were less sensitive to the single agent Riluzole in both in vitro MTT cell viability cell proliferation and anchorage independent colony assays. We began to examine different combinations of Riluzole and other inhibitors of downstream targets. We utilized Sorafenib, a small molecule inhibitor originally identified as a RAF kinase inhibitor that also inhibits several receptor tyrosine kinases involved in tumor progression and tumor angiogenesis (17). We also investigated PLX4720, a specific B-RAF V600E inhibitor (20). Sorafenib is FDA approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and is also a second line agent in renal cell carcinoma. Recent reports stressing the importance of C-RAF in B-RAF wild type melanomas has revived interest in the use of Sorafenib, in combination with other agents, for the treatment of melanoma. We now report that the combination of Riluzole and Sorafenib has an additive or synergistic effect in both B-RAF mutant and B-RAF wild type melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition to B-RAF inhibition, Sorafenib is a well-documented multi-kinase inhibitor of VEGF and other receptor tyrosine kinases (17). PLX4720/PLX4032 demonstrated remarkable preclinical results in in vitro and in vivo studies in suppressing melanoma cell growth. However, patients from these clinical trials were shown to become resistant to treatment with recurrence of melanoma occurring 5?9 months after start of their treatment. This stresses the need to re-examine the options in targeting melanoma effectively (48). In cultured cell studies, Sorafenib was not very effective in suppressing C8161 cell growth while it was effective in reducing the number of viable cells in both UACC903 and 1205Lu melanoma cell lines with mutated B-RAF. Surprisingly, the combinatorial in vitro studies in C8161 cells using Riluzole and Sorafenib showed a synergistic reduction in the number of viable cells while exerting an additive effect detected in UACC903 and 1205Lu cell lines under similar conditions. These results were again observed in in vivo xenograft studies where the combination of Riluzole and Sorafenib again led to a considerable reduction in tumor progression as evident by the decrease in tumor volumes over time in all three cell lines compared to controls. It is thus possible that Sorafenib enhances the cytotoxic effects of Riluzole through suppression of downstream targets of GRM1 signaling including the MAPK pathway. Stimulation of GRM1 was shown to modulate MAPK via the ERK mediated signaling pathway in GRM1-expressing human melanoma cells. We postulate that Riluzole decreases the levels of glutamate released from the cells disrupting the autocrine loops while Sorafenib also mediates its activities through inhibition of MAPK signaling resulting in a more profound inhibition in tumor cell growth and progression than with either agent alone in GRM1-expressing melanoma cells. It is however important to point out that Riluzole appears to suppress the MAPK pathway in a cell line dependent manner suggesting it is not the main pathway suppressing proliferation with Riluzole treatment. Recently, an alternative mode of action of Riluzole has been described with Riluzole serving as an enhancer of the Wnt-\u00a5\u00e2-catenin signaling pathway which induces melanoma cells to revert to a more normal melanocytic phenotype promoting hyper-pigmentation and reducing their proliferation and metastasis (45). PLX4720 displayed remarkable clinical responses as a single agent. Surprisingly when combined with Riluzole we did not detect further reduction in tumor cell growth in MTT or xenograft studies. This is in variance with the remarkable results observed with the combination of Riluzole and Sorafenib in vivo. We hypothesize that the encouraging results observed with the Sorafenib and Riluzole combination is likely due to Sorafenib\u00a1\u00afs role as a chemo-sensitizer by elimination of the pro-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1 resulting in enhanced cytotoxic response to Riluzole which has modest efficacy as a single agent. Elimination of Mcl-1 by Sorafenib has been shown to be through translational inhibition in a variety of cancer cell lines (29, 49). In melanoma, depletion of Mcl-1 enhances melanoma cell death by therapeutic compounds such as temozolomide and melphalan (30), sensitizes apoptosis resistance melanoma cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis (50) and renders melanoma cells susceptible to anoikis (51). Similar to other reports, we detected reduced levels of Mcl-1 only in Sorafenib treated B-RAF V600E human melanoma cells. Surprisingly, in C8161 melanoma cells with wild type BRAF, a decrease in Mcl-1 was also detected in the presence of Riluzole and Sorafenib suggesting that the reduced tumorigenicity observed in vivo may be mediated via a decline in Mcl-1. In light of these results, it is not surprising that Sorafenib but not PLX4720 sensitize the cells to Riluzole. Considering that the majority of human melanomas harbor B-RAF mutations, agents used to treat melanoma in the clinic need to function in the presence of these mutations. Our findings suggest that the combination of Riluzole and Sorafenib would be a reasonable, combinatorial therapy for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma and is currently undergoing clinical testing in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced melanomas. Translational Relevance. Recently, the potent inhibitor of B-RAF V600E, PLX4720/PLX4032, was reported to induce regression of melanocytic lesions in late-stage melanoma patients. However, a significant number of these patients became refractory to the treatment, experiencing recurrence in less than one year. Previously, we identified aberrantly expressed metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1) in ~65% of human melanoma biopsies and cell lines, suggesting the potential of developing GRM1 targeted therapies. A Phase II trial with Riluzole, an FDA approved inhibitor of glutamate release, showed mixed clinical responses with 42% of the patients exhibiting stable disease. Here, we show that Riluzole plus Sorafenib reduces the growth of wild type or B-RAF V600E human melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. The PLX4720 and Riluzole combination has additive effects in suppressing growth of B-RAF V600E melanoma cells but less so than the Sorafenib combination in the same cells in vitro and in vivo. These results propose a therapeutic regimen using Riluzole and Sorafenib to circumvent the drug resistance arising with the use of PLX4032 in melanoma patients. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Synergistic effect between erlotinib and MEK inhibitors in KRAS wildtype human pancreatic cancer cells\tPurpose. The combination of gemcitabine plus erlotinib has shown a small but statistically significant survival advantage when compared to gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. However, the overall survival rate with the erlotinib and gemcitabine combination is still low. In this study we sought to identify gene targets that, when inhibited, would enhance the activity of EGFR-targeted therapies in pancreatic cancer cells. Experimental Design. A high-throughput RNAi screen was carried out to identify candidate genes. Selected gene hits were further confirmed and mechanisms of action were further investigated using various assays. Results. Six gene hits from siRNA screening were confirmed to significantly sensitize BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells to erlotinib. One of the hits, MAPK1, was selected for further mechanistic studies. Combination treatments of erlotinib plus two MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors, RDEA119 and AZD6244, showed significant synergistic effect for both combinations (RDEA119-erlotinib and AZD6244-erlotinib) compared to the corresponding single drug treatments in pancreatic cancer cell lines with wild-type KRAS (BxPC-3 and Hs 700T) but not in cell lines with mutant KRAS (MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1). The enhanced antitumor activity of the combination treatment was further verified in the BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 mouse xenograft model. Examination of the MAPK signaling pathway by Western blotting indicated effective inhibition of the EGFR signaling by the drug combination in KRAS wildtype cells but not in KRAS mutant cells. Conclusions. Overall, our results suggest that combination therapy of an EGFR and MEK inhibitors may have enhanced efficacy in patients with pancreatic cancer. Introduction. With a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%, pancreatic cancer remains the most deadly of all major cancer types (1, 2). Gemcitabine has been the standard first line therapy for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer since 1996. Since then, multiple clinical trials combining gemcitabine with other chemotherapeutics have failed to show improvement in overall survival compared to gemcitabine alone (3-5). Until recently in 2005, the FDA approved the regimen of gemcitabine plus erlotinib (Tarceva\u00a2\u00e7), an EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitor based upon increased survival. The EGFR tyrosine kinase signaling pathway has been implicated in several cellular processes pertinent to cancer progression including cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Dysregulation of EGFR signaling occurs in as much as one-half of all pancreatic cancers (6). Erlotinib is a small molecular weight inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase that has shown clinical activity in patients with advanced non-small cell lung or pancreatic cancer. Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with the combination of erlotinib plus gemcitabine have shown statistical significant survival advantage over patients treated with gemcitabine alone. However, the overall response and survival rate with the erlotinib plus gemcitabine combination is still low with the survival rate at one year increased from 17% to 23% with the combination (7). The RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is one of the downstream effector pathways of the EGFR tyrosine kinase signaling. It is constitutively activated in multiple human tumors due to gain-of-function mutations in RAS or RAF. Of the RAS family, KRAS is more often mutated with approximately 20% of all human tumors possessing an activating mutation in codon 12, 13, and more rarely 61 (8). KRAS mutations are the most prevalent in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (70-90%) (9-11), followed by colorectal adenocarcinomas (35%) and lung carcinomas (17%) (12). Of the RAF family, mutations only in BRAF have been reported, but are mutually exclusive from a KRAS mutation. It is a rare exception that a tumor possesses both KRAS and BRAF mutations (13). Downstream of RAS and RAF is MEK1/2, which is critical to transmitting signals to ERK and has become an attractive pharmaceutical target in tumors harboring aberrant signaling in the MAPK pathway. AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) and RDEA119 (BAY 869766) are two potent MEK1/2 inhibitors that are currently in clinical development. AZD6244 is a selective ATP-uncompetitive inhibitor of MEK1/2, which has been reported to inhibit cellular growth and induce apoptosis in vitro and reduce tumor growth in the BxPC-3 and HT-29 xenograft models (14). RDEA119 is an allosteric, selective inhibitor of MEK1/2, which has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation in vitro and reduce tumor growth in various in vivo models (15). Clinically, RDEA119 is currently being evaluated in at least three studies: a Phase I dose-escalation study, a Phase I monotherapy in Japanese patients, and a Phase 1/2 study in combination with sorafenib in advanced cancer patients (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). In this study, we employed high throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screening approach to identify targets that would enhance the activity of erlotinib in pancreatic cancer cells. We determined that the combination of a MEK inhibitor and erlotinib has significant anti-tumor activity in a subset of pancreatic cancer cells that harbor wildtype KRAS in in vitro and in vivo models. Materials and Methods. Cell Line Culture. The pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3, Hs 700T, MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). Cells were cultivated in a humidified incubator at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and 5% CO2. Cells were harvested with 0.05% trypsin at 70-80% cell density. Cell line identities were verified by STR profiling (16) using the AmpFISTR Identifiler PCR amplification kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). This method simultaneously amplifies 15 STR loci and Amelogenin in a single tube, using 5 dyes, 6-FAM\u00a2\u00e2, JOE\u00a2\u00e2, NED\u00a2\u00e2, PET\u00a2\u00e2, and LIZ\u00a2\u00e2 which are then separated on a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). GeneMapper ID v3.2 software was used for analysis (Applied Biosystems). AmpFISTR control DNA and the AmpFISTR allelic ladder were run concurrently. Results were compared to published STR sequences from the ATCC. The STR profiling is repeated once a cell line has been passaged more than 6 months after previous STR profiling. siRNA library screening and hit selection. An RNAi screen using a library of short interfering (siRNA) duplex oligonucleotides targeting 588 known human kinase genes (2 siRNAs/gene, Qiagen, Germantown, MD) was performed to identify sensitizing targets for erlotinib using a reverse transfection protocol as described previously (17). Two non-silencing siRNAs were used as negative controls, while the AllStars Hs Cell Death Control (Qiagen) was used as a positive control. The siRNAs were first arrayed into 384-well plates for a final assay concentration of 20 nM in duplicates. The arrayed siRNAs was then incubated with 20 \u00a5\u00ecl serum-free RPMI 1640 cell culture media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 0.04 \u00a5\u00ecl siLentfect lipid reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at room temperature for 30 minutes. Next, BxPC-3 cells were plated to the siRNA-transfection reagent mix at 1,200 cells/well and serum-supplemented at a final concentration of 5%. The plates were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 24 hours. Afterwards, a serial dilution of erlotinib (6 concentrations between 0-100 \u00a5\u00ecM) was added to the wells and incubated for 96 hours. Cell viability was determined by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) and the luminescence was recorded with the Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The percent cell survival of the siRNA-erlotinib combination was normalized to the percent cell survival of corresponding siRNA alone control. The IC 50 values for each siRNA-erlotinib treatment were calculated by fitting the data to a sigmoid dose-response model using nonlinear regression with the Matlab software (2007a, The MathWorks Inc). Each siRNA was evaluated and ranked by the following qualifiers as potential hits: i.) the R 2 for the sigmoid fitting curve was greater than 0.9, ii.) the effect on cell viability of the siRNA itself was less than 50%, and iii.) two-fold or higher decrease in the IC 50 value compared to the Neg siRNA control. To further validate the positive gene hits, an additional 2 siRNA sequences (4 total) were obtained for each gene and subjected to a confirmation screen with 8 erlotinib concentrations using the same procedures described above. Genes that have at least 2 out of 4 siRNA sequences showing 2-fold or higher reduction in erlotinib IC 50 value compared to the Neg siRNA control were selected as confirmed hits. Verification of siRNA mediated mRNA and protein expression knock-down using RT-PCR and Western blotting. To evaluate the gene specific knock-down of mRNA expression by siRNA, cancer cells (250,000 cells/well) were reverse transfected with 20 nM of the MAPK1 siRNAs (Qiagen) for 72 hours in 6-well plates. The cells were then washed with DPBS twice and harvested with trypsinization. For RNA extraction, the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) was utilized following the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs recommended protocol. One microgram of total RNA was used in a 20 \u00a5\u00ecl cDNA synthesis reaction (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD). One microliter of the cDNA reaction mix, 10 \u00a5\u00ecl of FastStart SYBR Green Master mix (Roche), and 4 \u00a5\u00ecl of MAPK1 primer mix (5\u00a1\u00c7-TCATCCTCGGAAAACAGACC-3 \u00a1\u00c7 and 5 \u00a1\u00c7-TCAATGCTGTGTGGACCTTC-3\u00a1\u00c7, final concentration 0.4 \u00a5\u00ecM each) were combined. A separate reaction for GAPDH was included as a control, and the primers used were 5\u00a1\u00c7-ATTGCCCTCAACGACCACTT-3\u00a1\u00c7 and 5\u00a1\u00c7-GGTCCACCACCCTGTTGC-3\u00a1\u00c7. The real-time qPCR was performed using the MyIQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The cycling program used was 95\u00a1\u00c6C for 10 min, 95\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 sec, 58\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 sec, and 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 sec for 30 cycles. Each sample was run in duplicates, normalized to GADPH, and analyzed by the comparative C T method (18). For protein expression, the cells were washed with DPBS twice and subsequently lysed with RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) supplemented with Complete Mini protease cocktail and PhoSTOP (Roche). The lysates were incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). A total of 30 \u00a5\u00ecg of protein/lane was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane blots. The membranes were blocked for 1 hr with 5% fat-free milk at room temperature and then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal p42 MAP Kinase (Erk2) antibody (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling) overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. The blots were washed with Tris Buffered Saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) buffer for 3 times and then exposed to anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody (1:4000 dilution, Cell Signaling) at room temperature for 1 hour. The protein bands were visualized using the chemilumeniscence detection method (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Drug combination treatment and immunoblotting analysis. Erlotinib, AZD6244, and RDEA119 were purchased from ChemieTek (Indianapolis, IN) and dissolved in DMSO to make 50 mM (erlotinib) or 20 mM (AZD6244 and RDEA119) stock solutions. Cells were seeded into 384-well plates at 1,200 cells/well, allowed to grow for 24 hours, and then treated with drugs for another 96 hours. Ten concentrations of AZD6244 and RDEA119 were made in 1:3 serial dilutions in serum-free medium. Three drug concentrations of erlotinib were added in combination to the MEK inhibitors at 1:1 ratio concurrently. At the end of treatment, cell viability was determined by the CellTiter-Glo assay. The percent cell survival of erlotinib alone at the indicated drug concentration was normalized to the percent cell survival of the respective drug combination. The growth curves were plotted in the GraphPad Prism \u00a2\u00e7 v5 software and the IC 50 was determined by the software using the nonlinear regression (curve fit) analysis. For Western blot analysis, 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells were seeded in T25 flasks for overnight growth. The cells were treated with drugs in serum conditions similar to the 384-well assays. The drugs at concentrations indicated in the figure legends were added directly to the medium for incubation at hours indicated. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously. The cell lysates (30 \u00a5\u00ecg per lane, except 15 \u00a5\u00ecg for AKT) were separated on NuPAGE protein pre-cast gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) and then probed with specific antibodies using manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs recommended dilutions. The antibodies, phospho-MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) (pMAPK), MAPK, phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068) (pEGFR), EGFR, phospho-AKT (Ser473) (pAKT), AKT, BIM, PARP, cyclin D1, p27, and \u00a5\u00e2-actin were purchased from Cell Signaling. Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis. Apoptosis analysis was performed using the Annexin V: FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) following the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded and treated with the drugs as described previously for the immunoblotting studies. Afterwards, the cells were washed twice with DPBS and 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 1x Annexin V Binding Buffer. Cells undergoing apoptotic cell death was analyzed by counting the cells that stained positive for Annexin V FITC and negative for propidium iodide, and late stage of apoptosis, necrosis, or already dead as Annexin V FITC and propidium iodide positive using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Differences of the drug combination group compared to the single drug group was confirmed using an independent two-tailed t-Test, and considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. For cell cycle analysis, cells were treated with erlotinib (3 \u00a5\u00ecM and 12.5 \u00a5\u00ecM) and RDEA119 (100nM) alone or in combination as described above and harvested by trypsinization. The cells were resuspended and stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in a modified Krishan buffer (19) for one hour at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. The propidium iodide stained samples were then analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Immunocytometry systems, San Jose, CA). Histograms were analyzed for cell cycle compartments and the percentage of cells at each phase of the cell cycle was calculated using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc, Ashland, OR) analysis software. In vivo studies. Animal studies were performed at the Translational Genomics Research Institute Drug Development Services (TD2) under IACUC approved protocols. Female ICR-SCID mice (IcrTac: ICR-Prkdc scid) (Taconic, Hudson, NY) were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 0.1 ml of a 50% RPMI/50% Matrigel\u00a2\u00e2 (BD Biosciences) mixture containing a suspension of BxPC-3 (1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 7 cells/mouse) or MIA PaCa-2 (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells/mouse) tumor cells. Four days following inoculation, tumors were measured using calipers and tumor weight was calculated using the Study Director V.1.6.80a software (20). Tumor bearing mice were pair-matched into the six groups (8 mice/group) by random equilibration using Study Director (Day 1). Body weights were recorded when the mice were pair-matched and were taken twice weekly thereafter in conjunction with tumor measurements. On Day 1, RDEA119 (6 mg/kg), vehicle control (0.4% CMC), and erlotinib (50 mg/kg) were administered orally, while gemcitabine (BxPC-3, 40 mg/kg; MIAPaCa-2, 20 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection. RDEA119 and vehicle control were administered twice daily for eleven days. Erlotinib was dosed daily for 21 days. Gemcitabine was dosed three times per day for four days. The study was terminated when tumor burden exceeded 1000 mg in the Vehicle control group. Mean tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated utilizing the following formula, with X as the mean tumor weight: All statistical analyses in the xenograft study were performed with GraphPad Prism v4 software. Differences in final tumor weights were confirmed using an independent one-tailed t-Test, and considered statistically significant when p<0.05. Results. Inhibition of MAPK1 expression by siRNA sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to erlotinib. To identify gene targets that, when inhibited, sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to the treatment of erlotinib, we performed siRNA screening in the presence of a serial dilution of erlotinib in BxPC-3 cells using a kinase-focused siRNA library (See Material and Methods). A total of six genes were confirmed (Table 1). Of the six genes, the siRNA silencing of GCK and MAPK1 (ERK2) had the highest sensitizing effects on erlotinib (6-16 and 6-8 fold reduction in IC 50, respectively) (Fig. S1A and S1B), whereas BMPR2, BRAF, FLT3, and PRKAB2 had moderate effects (ranging from 2- to 7-fold reduction in IC 50) (Fig. S1C-F). Due to the high sensitizing effect of its siRNAs and its well known involvement in cancer, MAPK1 was selected for further validation. The specific knock-down of MAPK1 expression by the siRNAs was evaluated by qPCR and Western blotting analysis. Two MAPK1 siRNA sequences (MAPK1_1 and MAPK1_2) were able to achieve more than 80% efficiency in reducing mRNA transcript expression (data not shown) and protein expression levels at 72 hrs in all four cell lines (Fig. 1A and S3). The MAPK1 siRNA and erlotinib treatment in BxPC-3 cells were further repeated with 10 serial dilutions of erlotinib, mock-transfected control (Neg siRNA), and a drug alone control. The MAPK1 siRNA-erlotinib combinations yielded an IC 50 of a 6 fold-difference compared to both controls (Fig. 1B). The siRNA and erlotinib treatment was repeated in additional well-characterized pancreatic cancer cell lines, Hs 700T, MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1, to determine if the sensitizing effects of MAPK1 siRNA was cell-line specific. Of the three cell lines, Hs 700T had an IC 50 fold difference of 2.3 and 1.4 compared to the Neg siRNA control (Fig. S2A), while MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 exhibited no sensitizing effects in either MAPK1 siRNA (Fig. S2B-C). It is interesting to note that BxPC-3 and Hs 700T have previously been reported to have wildtype KRAS whereas MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 harbor a mutation at codon 12 (21). Sequencing of the KRAS open reading frame (ORF) of the 4 cell lines used in this study confirms the mutational status (data not shown). We therefore hypothesized that the sensitizing effect of MAPK1 siRNA might be specific to cells harboring wildtype KRAS. MEK inhibitors synergize with erlotinib to inhibit the proliferation of KRAS wildtype pancreatic cells. Since MAP kinase kinase (MEK) proteins phosphorylate and activate MAPK1, we postulated that small molecular weight inhibitors of MEK1/2 might be able to sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to the treatment of erlotinib. We obtained two MEK inhibitors, RDEA119 and AZD6244 and evaluated their synergism with erlotinib in multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines. The synergistic effect of the combination of RDEA119 and erlotinib was evaluated in the same four pancreatic cancer cell lines used in siRNA studies. It is noted that BxPC-3 and Hs 700T are moderately sensitive to erlotinib, while MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 are relatively less sensitive, which is consistent to other studies (Fig. S4) (22). As to RDEA119, PANC-1 is the least sensitive with an IC 50 of 1.5 \u00a5\u00ecM, BxPC-3 and Hs 700T are moderately sensitive at with IC 50s ranging between 300-700 nM, and MIA PaCa-2 is exquisitely sensitive with an IC 50 of 50 nM (15). Similar sensitivity profiles were observed for AZD6244 in these pancreatic cancer cell lines (data not shown). When fixed concentrations of erlotinib (12.5, 3.0, or 0.8 \u00a5\u00ecM) were added to a dose response curve of RDEA119, a significant synergistic effect was observed in BxPC-3 and Hs 700T cells (Fig. 2A-B). As the concentration of erlotinib decreased from 12.5 \u00a5\u00ecM to 0.8 \u00a5\u00ecM, the level of synergy (left shift of the dose response curves) decreased as well, indicating that the level of synergy was dose dependent between erlotinib and RDEA119. The synergistic effect is much more dramatic in BxPC-3 cell line (764-fold at 12.5 \u00a5\u00ecM of erlotinib) than in Hs 700T (14-fold at 12.5 \u00a5\u00ecM of erlotinib) (Table 2). No significant synergy was observed in MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells at the same drug concentrations (Fig. 2C-D). Higher concentrations of erlotinib (up to 50 \u00a5\u00ecM) did not show any significant synergy with RDEA119 (data not shown) in these two cell lines. Table 2 lists the IC 50 values of RDEA119 alone and RDEA119 plus erlotinib as well as the fold reduction when compared to RDEA119 alone in the four pancreatic cancer cell lines. Other pancreatic cancer cell lines, such as AsPC-1, CFPAC-1, and L3.6pl, are similar in sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors as BxPC-3 and Hs 700T, yet contain mutant KRAS (23, 24). No significant synergy was observed in these KRAS mutant cell lines at the same drug combination concentrations (Fig. S5A-C). Similar to RDEA119, AZD6244 showed a significant synergistic effect with erlotinib in BxPC-3 and Hs 700T (Fig. S6A-B). The synergism between AZD6244 and erlotinib is also dose dependent, although it is more apparent in Hs 700T than in BxPC-3. Interestingly, the synergistic effect between AZD6244 and erlotinib is more dramatic in Hs 700T cells than in BxCP-3 cells (64 fold vs. 15 fold at 12.5 \u00a5\u00ecM of erlotinib) (Table S1). There was no significant synergy between the two drugs in MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells (Fig. S6C-D). Based upon our current observations, we hypothesized that the efficacy of the EGFR and MEK inhibitor combination was limited to cells with wildtype KRAS. To determine if mutant KRAS was the determining factor for the lack of synergy, siRNA targeting the specific KRAS mutation in MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 (25) was transfected in combination with the treatment of erlotinib and RDEA119. In MIA PaCa-2, the inhibition of mutant KRAS yielded a synergistic effect between RDEA119 and 50 \u00a5\u00ecM of erlotinib (2.4 fold compared to erlotinib plus RDEA119) (Fig. S7A). As the dose of erlotinib was reducted to 25 \u00a5\u00ecM (Fig. S7B), the synergistic effect was lost. In PANC-1, sensitivity with the KRAS mutatnt specific siRNA plus drug combination was restored to by 1.5 fold compared RDEA119 in combination with erlotinib at 50 \u00a5\u00ecM (Fig S7C), but no difference at 25 \u00a5\u00ecM (Fig. S7D). Together, these results indicate that the synergism between erlotinib and the MEK inhibitors is restricted to pancreatic cancer cell lines with wildtype KRAS, further supporting the hypothesis that inhibition of MAPK1 function specifically sensitizes KRAS wildtype pancreatic cancer cells to the treatment of erlotinib. The erlotinib plus MEK inhibitor combination disrupts a negative feedback loop of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathways. Based on the observed synergistic effect of the erlotinib-RDEA119 combination in inhibiting cell proliferation, we assessed the phosphorylation activities within the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway. The MAPK signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation and survival, and we hypothesized that the synergy observed in the KRAS wildtype cells were, at least in part, due to the increased inhibition of the MAPK signaling. To examine the effect of drug treatment on MAPK signaling, both BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were treated with 12.5 \u00a5\u00ecM of erlotinib, 100 nM of RDEA119, or the combination for a time course of 8, 24, and 48 hr. The erlotinib concentration used in our experiments (12.5 \u00a5\u00ecM) is comparable to the pharmacokinetic variables documented in patients, which showed the trough, peak plasma, and average steady-state plasma concentrations of 9.6, 15.1, and 11.0 \u00a5\u00ecM, respectively (26-28). The 100 nM concentration of the MEK inhibitor is below pharmacokinetic plasma concentrations obtained in recent clinical studies (29, 30). In BxPC-3, erlotinib significantly decreased the pMAPK level over the time course while in MIA PaCa-2 there was little effect (Fig. 3), which is expected based on their KRAS mutational status. With the treatment of RDEA119 alone, the pMAPK level was effectively suppressed at 8 hr in both BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2. As time progressed the phosphorylation of MAPK was recovered in both cell lines but at a higher level in BxPC-3 to near basal levels by 48 hr. In the combination treatment, BxPC-3 showed sustained ablation of pMAPK activity throughout the time course, while MIA PaCa-2 recovered activity similar to RDEA119 alone by 48 hr. In addition, MEK inhibition led to a marked increase in pEGFR in BxPC-3 cells indicating a feedback between MEK inhibition and EGFR activation (Fig. 3A). This was most apparent at 48 hrs of RDEA119 treatment in BxPC-3, when the level of pEGFR dramatically increased compared to basal levels whereas the total EGFR levels remain the same. This observation was previously also reported in breast and lung cancer cell lines when treated with another MEK inhibitor, AZD6244 (31). The level of pEGFR was not changed in MIA PaCa-2 in any of the treatments. With the increased activation of EGFR by MEK inhibitors, the rationale of the combination of erlotinib and RDEA119 is evident in BxPC-3 as it inhibits both the activity from the receptor tyrosine kinase and its signaling cascade to MAPK. It has been noted in the literature that disruption of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway can shift signaling to AKT as a mode to maintain cell survival (32-34). In either of the drug treatments in MIA PaCa-2, pAKT levels did increase when compared to basal levels of the cells only control, yet the levels were not differentially affected in each respective group as time progressed (Fig. 3B). For BxPC-3, the combination increased pAKT levels at 8 hrs of treatment by 20% above the basal control, but as time progressed to 48 hrs, the combination reduced pAKT levels by 20% compared to basal control levels. RDEA119 alone increased pAKT in BxPC-3, while the erlotinib treatment slightly reduced it (Fig. 3A). The exquisite sensitivity of MIA PaCa-2 to the MEK inhibitors in our study is comparable to previous reports (35, 36). Results from a recent study reported that sensitivity to MEK inhibition was inversely correlated with the basal level of pAKT (37). In MIA PaCa-2, the basal level of pAKT was comparably lower than BxPC-3 (Fig. 3). Despite its sensitivity, the combination of MEK inhibition and erlotinib was not synergistic in MIA PaCa-2. Overall, these results showed that the synergy of the drug combination observed in BxPC-3 is likely due to the complete repression of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway and reduction of pAKT activity, whereas the lack of synergy in MIA PaCa-2 may be attributed to the residual activity of pMAPK and the increased levels of pAKT. Dual EGFR and MEK inhibition cooperatively induces apoptotic cell death. To further understand the mechanism of the synergism between EGFR and MEK inhibitions, we evaluated the degree of apoptosis with FITC Annexin V flow cytometric analysis and the expression of BIM and PARP in cells treated with erlotinib, RDEA119, or the combination. As shown in Figure 4A, the percentage of cells that were undergoing apoptosis (Annexin V positive/ PI negative) in BxPC-3 were significantly higher in the combination (28%) than the respective single drug treatments (erlotinib, 14% and RDEA119, 12%). The combination of erlotinib and RDEA119 cooperatively induces and enhances apoptotic cell death more than the single agents. The percentage of BxPC-3 cells in late-apoptosis or already dead (Annexin V positive/PI positive) was consistent with 26% with erlotinib, 21% with RDEA119, and 41% with the combination treatment (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in MIA PaCa-2, the erlotinib treatment elicited 12% of the cell population to undergo apoptosis, while RDEA119 was 24% and the combination was 26%. Similarly, the percentage of late-apoptosis was 19% with erlotinib, 58% with RDEA119, and 58% with combination treatment. Comparing RDEA119 and the combination, the level of apoptosis observed in the combination treatment in MIA PaCa-2 is due to mostly the effect of RDEA119 alone. Erlotinib does not synergistically nor additively enhance apoptosis in the combination in MIA PaCa-2. It has been reported that MAPK can inhibit the activity of several pro-apoptotic proteins by promoting its ubiquitination for proteasome-dependent degradation, more notably the BIM protein (38-40). Several studies have reported that BIM is a major target of MAPK-dependent survival signaling, and the up-regulation of BIM was required for committed apoptosis (41, 42). As single agents, erlotinib and RDEA119 had different effects on the pro-apoptotic BIM protein levels (Fig. 4C). In the cell lines treated with the inhibitors, BIM EL was the predominant isoform expressed. BIM EL expression moderately increased in BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells treated with either erlotinib or RDEA119, yet the drug combination induced the dephosporylated, stabilized, active form at 48 hrs more so in BxPC-3 than in MIA PaCa-2. Erlotinib or RDEA119 induced comparable levels of BIM expression and moderate apoptosis, but the combination is necessary to potently inhibit the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway in BxPC-3 and dramatically increase apoptotic cell death. The magnitude and duration of pMAPK inhibition committed BxPC-3 to pro-apoptotic signaling as seen by the up-regulation of BIM expression. Next, the analysis of cells undergoing apoptosis was evaluated by PARP cleavage. In MIA PaCa-2, there exists a basal level of PARP cleavage in the cells only control, but there was not a significant differential change in PARP cleavage with either drug treatments (Fig. 4C). The basal level of PARP cleavage in MIA PaCa-2 was similar in a previous study examining the in vitro activity of AZD6244 plus rapamycin (43). It is of note that the study used a high dose of AZD6244 at 1 \u00a5\u00ecM to induce PARP cleavage in both BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2. In this study, we used 100 nM of RDEA119, which increased PARP cleavage slightly in MIA PaCa-2 compared to those in the cells only control, erlotinib, and the combination. In contrast, PARP cleavage was observed only in the drug combination in BxPC-3, which is consistent with the results from the FITC Annexin V analysis. Finally, the effects of erlotinib and RDEA119 on the cell cycle distribution were examined. Consistent with the apoptotic immunoblot profiles, a substantial increase in the sub-G1 population was only observed in BxPC-3 in the combination treatment (Table S2). As the concentration of erlotinib was reduced from 12.5 \u00a5\u00ecM to 3 \u00a5\u00ecM, the differential affect on cell cycle was not significant. In MIA PaCa-2, the sub-G1 population was minimal in all of the drug treatments, but did exhibit some cell cycle arrest with an increase of G0/G1 population (Table S3). Accordingly, cyclin D1 levels were down-regulated with an increase of p27 (Fig. S8). The combination of erlotinib and RDEA119 demonstrates antitumor efficacy in vivo. The antitumor efficacy of the erlotinib plus RDEA119 combination was evaluated in BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 mouse xenografts. Consistent with in vitro observations, a significant effect of tumor growth suppression was seen in BxPC-3 in the combination treatment of erlotinib at 50 mg/kg and RDEA119 at 6 mg/kg with a TGI of 67% when compared to vehicle (p<0.001), and single drug dose controls of erlotinib had a TGI of 42% (p<0.05) and RDEA119 of 52% (p<0.01) by Day 24 (Fig. 5A). Similar antitumor effects were observed for a second dosing regimen (erlotinib at 50 mg/kg and RDEA119 at 12 mg/kg) (Data not shown). In MIA PaCa-2, no significant effect of tumor growth suppression was observed in the drug combination compared to vehicle (p=0.18) and RDEA119 (p=0.2) (Fig. 5B). Since the combination of erlotinib plus gemcitabine has shown small yet statistically significant survival advantage over patients treated with gemcitabine alone, we evaluated if the addition of gemcitabine to the erlotinib and RDEA119 combination treatment would enhance tumor growth suppression. The addition of gemcitabine significantly reduced tumor growth in BxPC-3 when compared to the combination treatment (p<0.01) (Fig. S9A). In MIA PaCa-2, gemcitabine did not enhance tumor suppression in addition to the erlotinib and RDEA119 combination treatment (p=0.13) (Fig. S9B). The effects of drug treatment did not notably affect the body weight of the mice during the treatment course. All treatment regiments were well tolerated with minimal weight losses (<10%) that are similar to that of vehicle control (Fig. 5C-D and S9C-D). Discussion. There have been multiple investigations of chemotherapeutics that target EGFR, and thereby inhibiting the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway in solid tumors. However, response rates for single agent remain relatively modest unless the EGFR-targeted therapy is combined with other chemotherapeutics or radiation (44). The use of high-throughput siRNA (HT-siRNA) screening is a powerful method in the development of therapeutic compounds, from target discovery to validation and elucidating mechanisms of action (45). In this study, we presented evidence of how efficacious the HT-siRNA screen was in discovering a rational drug combination to erlotinib in pancreatic cancer cells. Results from the screen identified several gene targets, that when inhibited, would enhance the cytotoxic activity of erlotinib. The targets identified in the screen may also present potential use molecular targets and provide interesting insight into molecular interactions of EGFR signaling inhibition in pancreatic cancer. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and its receptors BMPR1 and BMPR2 are overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells. The aberrant activation of BMP-2 and its receptors have been linked to significantly activate MAPK1 in pancreatic cancer cell lines, and treatment of a MAPK inhibitor blocks the BMP-2 mitogenic effects (46). Recently, in BRAF wildtype cells, RAF inhibitors can increase CRAF activity resulting in an increase of MEK/ERK phosphorylation and enhanced growth (47). The identification of the inhibition of BMPR2 and BRAF as enhancers to erlotinib further highlights how the activation of alternative protein kinases in the EGFR-MAPK pathway enables cancer cells to maintain the oncogenic potential when EGFR is inhibited. Sunitinib, a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, FLT3 among them (48), has been reported to sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to ionizing radiation by attenuating pAKT and pERK levels (49). GCK phosphorylates glucose to provide glucose-6-phosphate for the synthesis of glycogen and preferentially expresses in hepatocytes and pancreatic beta cells. PRKAB2 is a regulatory subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase, which regulates the intercellular metabolism of fatty acids and glycogen. Although both GCK and PRKAB2 have not been studied in the context of pancreatic cancer, both genes have been associated to diabetes (50-52). The use of MEK inhibitors to perturb the activity of MAPK has been reported to have efficacy in pancreatic models (36, 53). Other groups have reported on the synergistic effect of EGFR and MEK inhibition. Jimeno et al reported on the efficacy of the combined EGFR and MAPK inhibitors in biliary and pancreatic cancer. Their discovery was based upon global analysis of gene expression profiles on biliary cancer cell lines that were resistant to EGFR-targeted therapeutics, gefitinib and erlotinib, and then confirmed the activity in vivo in human pancreatic cancer xenografts with minimal mechanistic studies to explain the synergy in their pancreatic cancer model (54). In EGFR-dependent lung cancer cell lines, Balko et al observed synergistic cytotoxicity with the combination of EGFR and MEK inhibitors only in cells with wildtype KRAS (55). Yoon et al recently reported the synergistic effect between gefitinib and AZD6244 in gastric and lung cancer cells (56, 57). The authors found that the combination treatment repressed AKT and ERK activation and consequently enhanced apoptosis. The occurrence of somatic KRAS mutations is a highly predictive marker of resistance to anti-EGFR chemotherapies. In colorectal cancer, KRAS mutations were associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapies (cetuximab and panitumumab) in patients with metastatic disease, while KRAS wildtype predicted efficacy in terms of tumor response and patient survival (58-60). In non-small cell lung cancer, KRAS mutations are attributed to the poor response to erlotinib and gefitinib (61). In pancreatic cancer, the combination of gemcitabine and erlotinib exhibited modest (6.24 vs. 5.91 months) but statistically significant improvement in overall survival (7). As KRAS mutations are reported so prevalently in pancreatic cancer, our study does raise the issue of the status of KRAS for patients that may benefit from the treatment of erlotinib plus a MEK inhibitor. In summary, we have shown a synergistic effect between erlotinib and two clinically relevant MEK inhibitors, RDEA119 and AZD6244, in a subset of KRAS wildtype pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results provide a clear biological rationale for the investigation of erlotinib in combination with a MEK inhibitor in KRAS wildtype pancreatic cancer. Statement of Translational Relevance. With a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%, pancreatic cancer is among the most lethal types of human cancers. Current therapies are mostly ineffective and new therapies are desperately needed. This manuscript describes the synergistic effect between erlotinib and MEK inhibitors in pancreatic cancer cells and animal models. We demonstrate that the combination of erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, and several MEK inhibitors have enhanced efficacy in pancreatic cancer cells with wildtype KRAS. This work is highly translational since further evaluation of the combination treatment may result in new and improved treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. Supplementary Material. 1.

                "text": "A recombinant immunotoxin engineered for increased stability by adding a disulfide bond has decreased immunogenicity\tRecombinant immunotoxins (RITs) are anti-cancer agents that combine the Fv of an antibody against cancer cells with a protein toxin from bacteria or plants. Since RITs contain a non-human protein, immunogenicity can be an obstacle in their development. In this study, we have explored the hypothesis that increasing stability can reduce the immunogenicity of a RIT using HA22-LR, which is composed of an anti-CD22 Fv fused to domain III of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. We introduced a disulfide bond into domain III by identifying and mutating two structurally adjacent residues to cysteines at sites suggested by computer modeling. This RIT, HA22-LR-DB, displays a remarkable increase in thermal stability and an enhanced resistance to trypsin degradation. In addition, HA22-LR-DB retains cytotoxic and anti-tumor activity, while exhibiting significantly lower immunogenicity in mice. This study demonstrates that it is possible to design mutations in a protein molecule that will increase the stability of the protein and thereby reduce its immunogenicity. Introduction. The human immune system is essential to protect the body against disease, but can be detrimental under certain circumstances. The therapeutic use of exogenous proteins to treat human disease is one such situation. Many potentially beneficial proteins are recognized as foreign by the human immune system, eliciting the formation of neutralizing antibodies that limit clinical efficacy. Due to increasing interest in the use of proteins as clinical therapeutics, the issue of immunogenicity has become significant. During the development of a therapeutic protein, it is essential to evaluate the protein's immunogenicity and take steps to reduce or eliminate it if necessary (Presta, 2006). Recombinant immunotoxins (RITs) are protein therapeutics that combine a fragment of an antibody to a tumor-associated antigen with a protein toxin in order to specifically target and kill cancer cells. Several cancer-specific antigens are being used as targets for cancer therapy with RITs. These include CD22, CD25, mesothelin and the IL-3 receptor (Hall et al., 1999; Kreitman et al., 2000a; Su et al., 2009; Prince et al., 2010). Immunotoxins now in clinical trials contain portions of diphtheria toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) or ricin (Pastan et al., 2006, 2007). In our laboratory, we have developed RITs based on PE in which the variable fragment (Fv) of an antibody is fused to a 38-kDa truncated portion of PE, called PE38 (Fig.?1A). Several of these RITs are in clinical trials (Kreitman et al., 2000b, 2001, 2005; Hassan et al., 2007). The RIT moxetumomab pasudotox (MP), previously known as HA22 or CAT-8015, is being evaluated in the treatment of various B cell malignancies. It contains an affinity-optimized Fv reactive with CD22 fused to PE38. MP has produced complete remissions in \u00a1\u00ad40% of patients with hairy cell leukemia and complete or partial remissions in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Kreitman et al., 2001; Wayne et al., 2010). Native PE is a 613-residue (66-kDa) protein made up of three major domains. Domain Ia is located at the N-terminus of the protein and binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, which is present on many cell types. In RITs, domain Ia is deleted and replaced with an Fv targeting cancer cells (Hwang et al., 1987). Domain II is proposed to assist in the translocation of PE from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol, but does not seem to be universally required for activity (Weldon et al., 2009). Domain III is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose moiety from NAD + to elongation factor 2 (EF-2), arresting protein synthesis and ultimately leading to cell death (Pastan et al., 2007). HA22-LR (Fig.?1A) is a new RIT that contains deletions removing protease sites in domain II (Weldon et al., 2009). HA22-LR is resistant to degradation by lysosomal enzymes, and is also less immunogenic than HA22 (Hansen et al., 2010). We have recently reported that we have introduced eight mutations into HA22-LR to make HA22-LR-8M, which does not induce antibodies in mice when injected repeatedly by the intravenous route (Onda et al., 2008). Although this approach appears promising, we are still interested in exploring other approaches that could be used to decrease immunogenicity of immunotoxins and other proteins. In the current study, we have sought to reduce the immunogenicity of HA22-LR further by introducing a disulfide bond into domain III. We predicted that a disulfide bond would increase the thermal stability and protease resistance of HA22-LR, leading to less efficient processing and presentation to the immune system. We used molecular modeling to choose a location for the new disulfide bond and produced the new immunotoxin (HA22-LR-DB) in Escherichia coli. We show here that HA22-LR-DB retains high cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, is resistant to heat denaturation and proteolysis by trypsin, and is less immunogenic than HA22-LR in mice. Materials and Methods. Construction, expression and purification. We used computer modeling to choose the positions for a disulfide bond by examining the crystal structure of PE domain III (PDB ID code 1AER) (Li et al., 1996). The residues Arg 513 and Tyr 600 in domain III were selected and mutated to cysteines using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing (BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit; Applied Biosystems). HA22-LR-DB was expressed in E.coli BL21 (\u00a5\u00ebDE3) in a T7-based expression system and purified by the established protocol (Pastan et al., 2004). Assays for accessible thiols were performed as previously described to determine the presence of free cysteines in HA22-LR-DB (Ellman and Lysko, 1979; Beer et al., 2004). Activity assays in vitro. CD22-positive human Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (CA46, Raji, Daudi and Ramos) and ALL cell lines (KOPN-8 and WSU) were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of RITs. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine (Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin (Invitrogen) and 100 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5000 cells in 100 \u00a5\u00ecl per well containing various concentrations of immunotoxin. Viable cell concentrations were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo, Japan). After 3 days of culture, 10 \u00a5\u00ecl of CCK-8 per well was added and incubated for 3 h at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a CO 2 incubator. Wells without immunotoxin were used as positive controls for cell viability. A cell-free assay to examine the inactivation of EF-2 was performed as described previously (Pastrana and FitzGerald, 2006) using the TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) and a high-sensitivity \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase assay kit (Stratagene). Anti-tumor activity in vivo. A CA46 xenograft tumor model using female severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice was used to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of RITs in vivo as described previously (Kreitman et al., 1999). Animals were handled according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Cancer Institute. Tumor sizes were measured by caliper and calculated using the formula: tumor volume (mm 3) = length \u00a1\u00bf (width) 2 \u00a1\u00bf 0.4. When an average tumor size of \u00a1\u00ad110 mm 3 was reached 6 days after tumor implantation, mice were treated on Days 6, 8 and 10 with intravenous (i.v.) injections of vehicle (200 \u00a5\u00ecl of 0.2% human serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) or either of the RITs HA22-LR or HA22-LR-DB (2.0 mg/kg in 200 \u00a5\u00ecl vehicle). Each treatment group consisted of five mice. Immunization studies. The immunogenicity of HA22-LR-DB was evaluated in Balb/C mice (n= 10) as previously described (Onda et al., 2008). An immune complex-captured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ICC-ELISA) was performed to measure the titer of antibody (Friguet et al., 1985; Onda et al., 2006). Thermal stability. RITs (20 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml) were heated to various temperatures ranging from 45 to 90\u00a1\u00c6C for 15 min using a thermal cycler. Samples were placed on ice immediately after heat treatment and evaluated for activity. Trypsin digestion. RITs (0.3 mg/ml) were treated with 0.2 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml trypsin (Roche) in 100 mM Tris, 1 mM CaCl 2, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.5. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for various times between 0 and 8 h before the addition of tris-glycine sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer immediately followed by incubation at 85\u00a1\u00c6C for 5 min. Samples were analyzed on an 18% acrylamide gel by tris-glycine SDS?polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS?PAGE) (Invitrogen) and Microwave Blue Coomassie blue protein stain (Protiga, Frederick, MD, USA). Results. Design and preparation of mutant immunotoxin. To determine the best location for a disulfide bond in domain III, we obtained the coordinates of atoms in the crystal structure of domain III from the Protein Databank (PDB ID 1AER) and searched for residue pairs >20 residues apart in the primary sequence in which the alpha carbon (C \u00a5\u00e1) to C \u00a5\u00e1 distance was 3.8?7.0 A and the beta carbon (C \u00a5\u00e2) to C \u00a5\u00e2 distance was 3.4?4.7 A. Thirty different pairs of residues were located. We then visually examined each of the 30 possible pairs and rejected all but six, typically because they were located in or close to the active site or because their side chains were oriented in a manner unfavorable for disulfide bond formation. Here we report the properties of a protein in which one of these pairs, Arg 513 and Tyr 600, was used to generate a disulfide bond in the construct HA22-LR (Weldon et al., 2009) (Fig.?1A and B). After constructing, expressing and purifying this new mutant, HA22-LR-DB, we analyzed it by SDS?PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig.?2). The protein was over 95% pure. An assay for free thiol groups showed that there was 0.15 mol of free-thiol per mol of HA22-LR, and 0.25 mol of free-thiol per mol of HA22-LR-DB (data not shown). The difference in free thiol concentration is minimal, and we conclude that a new disulfide bond was generally well-formed, formed between residues 513 and 600. Cytotoxicity activity. We evaluated the cytotoxicity of HA22-LR-DB on several CD22-positive human B cell lines (CA46, Raji, Daudi, Ramos, KOPN-8 and WSU). Cells were incubated with a series of concentrations of HA22-LR or HA22-LR-DB for 3 days, and cell viability was measured by a WST-8 assay. Representative data for CA46 (Fig.?3A) and Raji (Fig.?3B) are shown, and IC 50 values for all experiments are presented in Table?I. Compared with HA22-LR, HA22-LR-DB was 2?4-fold less active on most cell lines tested, but retained cytotoxic activity on all cell lines and was slightly more active on Ramos cells. Notably, the IC 50 of HA22-LR-DB was well below the 500?1000 ng/ml level reached in patients currently receiving MP (Kreitman et al., 2001). To determine the ability of the mutant immunotoxin to catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of EF-2, we used a cell-free protein synthesis assay in which the EF-2-dependent synthesis of \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase is measured to assess the activity of PE (Pastrana and FitzGerald, 2006). As shown in Fig.?3C, HA22-LR-DB and HA22-LR had similar abilities to inhibit the synthesis of \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase (HA22-LR IC 50 = 89.4 ng/ml; HA22-LR-DB IC 50 = 78.2 ng/ml). Anti-tumor activity in mice. The anti-tumor activities of HA22-LR and HA22-LR-DB were evaluated using a CA46 mouse xenograft tumor model (Kreitman et al., 1999). SCID mice with CA46 tumors were treated intravenously with 2 mg/kg of HA22-LR or HA22-LR-DB on Days 6, 8 and 10 post-implantation. The RITs had similar anti-tumor activities, causing complete regressions of all tumors that lasted \u00a1\u00ad1 week (Fig.?3D). Immunogenicity studies. To evaluate the relative immunogenicity of HA22-LR-DB and HA22-LR, Balb/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 \u00a5\u00ecg of HA22-LR-DB or HA22-LR every 7 days for four treatment cycles and bled 7 days after each injection. Serum levels of antibody against the RITs were measured using ICC-ELISA (Onda et al., 2008), in which the antigen?antibody interaction takes place in solution before being captured on a plate for detection. As shown in Figure?4, the sera from the first and second bleeds of mice treated with either RITs showed no difference from the phosphate-buffered saline control. The antibody titers of both RITs in the third and fourth bleeds were increased, but significantly lower in mice treated with HA22-LR-DB compared with mice treated with HA22-LR (P< 0.01 for the third bleed and P< 0.05 for the fourth bleed). This result suggests that the addition of a disulfide bond to HA22-LR decreases its immunogenicity. Thermal stability. Having shown that HA22-LR-DB retained enzymatic and cell-killing activity, we next examined its thermal stability. Samples of HA22-LR-DB and HA22-LR were heated for 15 min at various temperatures and assessed using a cytotoxicity assay on CA46 cells (Fig.?5). HA22-LR lost significant cytotoxic activity when incubated at 55\u00a1\u00c6C and was completely inactivated at 75\u00a1\u00c6C. In marked contrast, HA22-LR-DB showed a much higher thermal stability, being totally resistant to inactivation at 70\u00a1\u00c6C. Only when heated to 80\u00a1\u00c6C did HA22-LR-DB lose activity. These results demonstrate a significant increase in thermal stability by introducing a disulfide bond into HA22-LR-DB. Stability to trypsin degradation. We evaluated the resistance of HA22-LR-DB to proteolytic digestion using trypsin, a serine protease that preferentially cleaves polypeptide chains after arginine or lysine residues (Olsen et al., 2004). The temporal cleavage pattern of trypsin-treated aliquots of HA22-LR and HA22-LR-DB, incubated for up to 8 h, was analyzed by reducing SDS?PAGE (Fig.?6). At the 0 time point both RITs show two bands corresponding to the light chain Fv polypeptide (V L) (12 kDa) and heavy chain Fv polypeptide (V H)-PE (39 kDa) portions of the disulfide-bonded fragments of the full-length protein. Fragments of both proteins were generated as the reaction proceeded, but there was a clear delay in the digestion of the 25-kDa domain III fragment of HA22-LR-DB following its anticipated release from the V H fragment by trypsin cleavage of the protease-sensitive linker (Weldon et al., 2009). The data show that the 25-kDa fragment from the HA22-LR-DB was still present after 4 h of digestion in the HA22-LR-DB sample, whereas it was not detected after 2 h treatment of HA22-LR. These results show that the addition of a disulfide bond into domain III of HA22-LR increases its resistance to trypsin degradation. Discussion. We describe here the production and characterization of a new RI T, HA22-LR-DB. We introduced a disulfide bond into domain III of PE, the domain that catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of EF-2. The presence of the new disulfide bond in the mutant protein was verified using an assay to detect free thiol. The mutant protein retains cytotoxic activity on several CD22+ B cell tumor lines and shows potent anti-tumor activity in mice bearing CA46 xenograft tumors. Its immunogenicity has been decreased and its stability has been increased. We found a large enhancement in thermal stability and increased resistance to trypsin degradation for HA22-LR-DB when compared with its parental molecule, HA22-LR. Although HA22-LR-DB exhibited the same activity as HA22-LR in a cell-free assay measuring the inhibition of protein synthesis, its activity varied on cell lines. It was generally 2-3-fold less active than HA22-LR on cell lines except for Ramos, where it was more active. We suspect that this difference may be due to the disulfide bond preventing the efficient translocation of PE into the cytosol by decreasing its conformational flexibility. The thermodynamic consequences of the introduction of a disulfide bond have been well studied (Pace et al., 1988; Pace, 1990; Wedemeyer et al., 2000), but the addition of a disulfide bond does not always lead to protein stabilization. Pace et al. analyzed thermodynamic data of ribonuclease T1 to show that one disulfide bond can contribute 3.4 kcal/mol and two disulfide bonds contribute 7.2?9.3 kcal/mol of stabilizing energy (Pace, 1990). Pecher et al., however, has reported that only two out of six variants of ribonuclease A with an additional disulfide bond demonstrated enhanced protein stability (Pecher and Arnold, 2009). This result suggests that the position of the disulfide bond is key to increasing protein stability. We used computer-aided rational design to choose the positions for the additional disulfide bond (Reina et al., 2002; Mandell and Kortemme, 2009), and determined that Arg 513 and Tyr 600 were excellent candidates. The thermal stability of HA22-LR-DB (R513C and Y600C) was remarkably increased over HA22-LR. HA22-LR-DB retained cytotoxicity after heating to 70\u00a1\u00c6C, whereas HA22-LR showed a dramatic loss of activity after heating to 55\u00a1\u00c6C (Fig.?5). Consistent with increased thermal stability, HA22-LR-DB also demonstrated enhanced resistance to proteolytic degradation. We found that the 25-kDa major degradation fragment of HA22-LR-DB remained visible after a 4 h digestion with trypsin, whereas the same fragment derived from HA22-LR had disappeared by the 2 h digestion point (Fig.?6). We propose that the resistance of HA22-LR-DB to trypsin degradation is due to a conformational stabilization in domain III of PE, caused by the additional disulfide bond, which limits the accessibility of HA22-LR-DB to trypsin. We are planning to use lysosomal extracts from cells in vitro or measuring RIT degradation in cells to study the effect on this process. In addition to the enhanced stability, HA22-LR-DB demonstrates significantly lower immunogenicity than HA22-LR in mice, although immunogenicity was not eliminated. The effect of disulfide bond incorporation into the immunotoxin was found to alter the kinetics of antibody formation in mice (Fig.?4), where a pronounced lag was observed compared with its parent molecule HA22-LR. Subsequently, the slopes of the two curves appear more or less parallel. Therefore, the effects of disulfide bond incorporation affect the early stage of antibody formation, and do not necessarily translate into lower steady-state levels once the titers plateau. In clinical studies, we have observed a correlation between the number of treatment cycles and favorable clinical responses. The results of our clinical trials in hairy cell leukemia showed that most patients need to get 1?4 cycles of the treatment to achieve complete responses (Kreitman et al., 2005). Based on these clinical data, the delayed onset of an immune response to HA22-LR-DB could allow patients to receive more cycles. We believe that the disulfide-enhanced stability may reduce the efficiency of the protein degradation that must precede presentation to T lymphocytes, and subsequent activation of the humoral immune response. However, it is possible that mutations at R513C and Y600C affected the epitope recognition by CD4T cells and consequently reduced the immunogenicity of the RIT. Another possibility is that the disulfide bond introduction changed the conformation of HA22-LR-DB, which may affect the B cell immune response. Further studies are needed for clarifying these points. A previous report by Delamarre et al. describes a parallel relationship between protease resistance and immunogenicity for ribonuclease-A and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Delamarre et al., 2006). Protease-resistant forms of ribonuclease and HRP were more immunogenic, which is in apparent conflict with our finding that a more stable protein is less immunogenic. In contrast to our study, Delamarre et al. did not attempt to enhance protein stability, but instead created destabilized variants of the two proteins using different mechanisms. Native ribonuclease-A was compared with a less stable variant in which native residues 1?20 were non-covalently bound to a truncated variant missing those residues. HRP was compared with apo-HRP, in which the calcium and heme groups were removed to decrease stability. Here, we used point mutations to generate a disulfide bond that enhanced the stability of a PE-based RIT. Further experiments are needed to understand how the mechanism of stabilization or destabilization contributes to immunogenicity. In summary, the aim of this study was to decrease the immunogenicity of PE-based RITs used in clinical therapy. We introduced a disulfide bond into the RIT HA22-LR and produced the molecule HA22-LR-DB, which demonstrated enhanced stability to heat and proteolytic degradation. HA22-LR-DB retains good biological activity, and exhibits significantly lower immunogenicity in mice relative to its parent molecule. We believe that a strategy of using disulfide bonds to stabilize proteins can be exploited to reduce the immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins, resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy and potency.

Bioassays were used to determine whether mutation reduced potency, and ELISA studies were performed to determine whether anti-toxin antibodies were reduced. A genetically altered luciferase MIA PaCa-2 xenograft model was used to image in real time and determine affects on systemic malignant human cancer. BLTs targeting B cells were used as specificity controls. Results. dEGF4KDEL was significantly effective following systemic injection against established orthotopic MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer and selectively prevented metastasis. Mutagenesis significantly reduced anti-toxin levels in vivo with no apparent activity loss in vitro. The drug was effective against three human pancreatic cancer lines in vitro, MIA PaCa-2, SW1990, and S2VP10. Conclusions. Despite the metastatic nature of the MIA PaCa-2 orthotopic tumor xenografted in nude mice, high percentages of tumors responded to extended dEGFKDEL treatment resulting in significant anti-cancer effects and disease-free survivors. Introduction. Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis and surgery is effective in only 10?15% of the cases. Thousands die each year because of rapid growth and metastasis (1, 2). Despite drug therapy, the median survival time is measured in months (3, 4). Pancreatic tumors are known to overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane signaling protein from the erbB family (5, 6). Studies have revealed a link between EGFR signaling pathways and malignancy (7). Therefore, fusion toxins targeting EGFR show promise for pancreatic cancer therapy (8?11). In some of the earlier work, targeted toxins directed by transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) exerted growth inhibitory effects on cells bearing a high number of EGF receptors (12). Interleukin 4 receptor (IL-4R) is another putative pancreatic cancer target and is expressed on pancreatic tumors. For example, investigators showed that 6 of 6 pancreatic cancer cell lines examined expressed IL-4R (13) and that IL-4R is internalized at high levels after binding to IL-4 (14, 15). IL-4R-directed fusion toxins have also been shown to kill pancreatic tumor cells (14). IL-4R is an excellent target because its normal expression is mostly limited to hematopoietic cells. In this study, we examined a novel single-chain recombinant bispecific ligand directed toxin (BLT) by linking human EGF and genetically altered IL-4 to a fragment of deimmunized Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38). PE catalyzes ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2) leading to irreversible inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death at very low concentrations (16). One major shortcoming of this class of drugs is the immunogenicity of the toxin (17?19). Multiple treatments with drug are necessary to cause tumor regressions and this results in the generation of anti-toxin antibodies that block drug efficacy. Onda and Pastan recently mapped seven major immunodominant epitopes in PE38 that can be mutated without loss of toxin activity (18,19). Thus, we used this advancement to produce a new deimmunized anti-pancreatic cancer biological drug. In this study, deimmunized EGF4KDEL (dEGF4KDEL) was bioengineered and compared to its monospecific counterparts in vitro. The superior anti-proliferative activity against the human pancreatic cell line MIA PaCa-2 translated into a potent in vivo anti-pancreatic cancer effect in a systemic, orthotopic, pancreatic cancer xenograft model in which tumor growth could be monitored in real time. The fact that this agent is deimmunized allowing for multiple treatments renders it an improvement over our earlier attempts at BLT development. Material and Methods. Construction of EGF4KDEL and dEGF4KDEL. DNA shuffling and PCR assembly techniques were used to assemble the genes encoding the single chain bispecific immunotoxin EGF4KDEL. The fully assembled fusion gene (from 5\u00a1\u00c7 end to 3\u00a1\u00c7 end) consisted of an Nco1 restriction site, an ATG initiation codon, the genes for human EGF and circularly permutated human IL-4 linked by a 20 amino-acid segment of human muscle aldolase (HMA), the 7 amino-acid EASGGPE linker, the first 362 amino acids of the PE molecule with KDEL replacing the REDLK at the c-terminus, and a Not I restriction site at the 3\u00a1\u00c7 end of the construct (Figure 1). The HMA segment was incorporated into the molecule as a flexible, non-immunogenic linker (20). The gene-encoding circularly permuted IL-4 was generously provided by Dr. R.J. Kreitman and Dr. I Pastan (NIH, Bethesda MD, USA). The resultant 1752 bp NcoI/NotI fragment gene was spliced into the pET21d bacteria expression vector under control of an isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible T7 promoter. The gene was cloned and verified by sequencing (Biomedical Genomics Center, University of Minnesota). The monospecific agents, EGFKDEL and IL4KDEL were created using the same techniques. To create a deimmunized EGF4KDEL, eight amino acids representing the seven major epitopes on PE38 (18) were mutated using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene. La Jolla CA, USA). The following amino acids were altered and verified: R490A, R513A, R467A, E548S, K590S, R432G, Q332S, R313A. Additional BLTs targeting hematological malignancies were assembled and used as negative controls in this study. CD3CD3KDEL, a negative control, consisting of two repeating scFvs targeting human CD3 was made by replacing the DT390 portion of the DTCD3CD3 molecule described previously (21), with PE38KDEL. Deimmunized 2219ARLKDEL, a negative control recognizing human B cells, was produced by joining two scFvs specific for human anti-CD22 and anti-CD19 to the same deimmunized PE38KDEL used in dEGF4KDEL (22). Isolation of inclusion bodies, refolding and purification. Proteins were produced as described previously (23) with some minor modifications to improve yield and purity. Then, 10 mg/ml of dithiothreitol was included in refolding buffer to decrease protein aggregation. In addition, refolded protein was directly diluted instead of being dialyzed before loading onto an ion exchange column. Finally, the purity of protein isolated from the ion exchange column was further enhanced using an FPLC and Superdex 200 HiLoad 26/60 size exclusion column (Sigma, Ronconcoma, NY, USA). This modified protocol resulted in a yield of 5 ? 10 mg of protein per liter of culture and a final product with 95% purity. Cell culture. The human malignant pancreatic cell lines MIA PaCa-2, S2VP10, SW1990 (24) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). Cell lines were maintained in DMEM (MIA PaCa-2) or RPMI-1640 (S2VP10, SW1990) (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/LL-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Cell cultures were incubated in a humidified 37\u00a1\u00c6C atmosphere containing 5% CO2. When adherent cells were 80?90% confluent they were passaged using trypsin-EDTA for detachment. Only cells with viability >95%, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, were used for experiments. For in vivo experiments, MIA PaCa-2 cells were stably transfected with dual vectors containing both the firefly luciferase (luc) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) genes, as well as a Blastocidin resistance gene (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA, USA). Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and stable clones were established using a FACS Diva flow cytometer (University of Minnesota Flow Cytometry Core Facility of the Masonic Cancer Center) to seed individual GFP-positive cells in a 96-well plate. MIA PaCa-2-luc retained identical morphological and biological properties to the specific parental cell line and was maintained with additional 10 \u00a5\u00ecg of Blastocidin (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). Bioassays to measure in vitro protein synthesis inhibition. To determine the effect of EGF4KDEL and dEGF4KDEL on pancreatic cancer cell lines, a proliferation assay measuring 3H-thymidine incorporation was used. Cells (10 4 per well) were added to a 96-well flat-bottomed plate and incubated overnight at 37\u00a1\u00c6C with 5% CO 2 to allow cells to adhere. The BLTs in varying concentrations were added to wells in triplicate. Incubation at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and 5% CO 2 continued for 72 hours. [Methyl- 3H]-thymidine (GE Healthcare, UK) was added (1 \u00a5\u00ecCi per well) for the final 8 hours of incubation. Plates were frozen to detach cells and cells were then harvested onto a glass fiber filter, washed, dried, and counted using standard scintillation methods. Data are reported as a percentage of control counts. For blocking studies, increasing concentrations of EGF4 were mixed with 1 nM EGF4KDEL. Subsequent mixtures were added to wells containing MIA PaCa-2 cells. All other aspects of blocking assays were identical to the procedure listed above for proliferation assays. In some cases, bioactivity was similarly assessed using 3H-leucine incorporation assay (22). The procedure was identical with the thymidine proliferation assay except leucine-free media (Caisson Labs, North Logan, UT, USA) was used and the incubation period after 3H-leucine (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK) addition (1 \u00a5\u00ecCi per well) was longer (24 hrs). Data collection and analysis proceeded as described above. CD3CD3KDEL, a recombinant bispecific scFv targeting T cells was used as a negative control to establish selectivity. Determining immunogenicity of EGF4KDEL and dEGF4KDEL in BALB/c mice. Mouse immunization studies were used to determine whether mutated dEGF4KDEL elicited less of an immune response than non-mutated parental EGF4KDEL. Female BALB/c mice (n=5/group) were injected intraperitoneally once weekly with 0.25 \u00a5\u00ecg of either EGF4KDEL or dEGF4KDEL for 63 days. Each week, five days after injection, the mice were bled (facial vein collection) to obtain serum. Serum from each mouse was isolated using centrifugation and frozen. Levels of anti-PE38KDEL IgG in each serum sample was measured using ELISA. Briefly, 5 \u00a5\u00ecg of purified recombinant PE38KDEL was added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and adhered overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. Unbound protein was washed away with PBS-T and blocking was performed for 1 h with 5% milk/PBS-T. Serum samples were diluted in 1:10,000 and 100 \u00a5\u00ecl of each was added to appropriate wells in triplicate. Following 3 hrs incubation, each well was washed 3 times with PBS-T. Peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was added to each well for 2 hrs room-temperature incubation. After washing, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate was added to each well. After 30 min, the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a microplate reader. Quantification of actual anti-PE38KDEL IgG present in each sample was determined by comparing the absorbance values in each well to a standard curve prepared using M40-1 monoclonal anti-PE38KDEL antibody from Dr. Robert Kreitman (NIH, Bethesda, MD). In vivo efficacy of EGF4KDEL and dEGF4KDEL against orthotopic pancreatic cancer xenograft model. Male nu/nu mice or normal mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Animal Production Area and housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited specific pathogen-free facility under the care of the Department of Research Animal Resources, University of Minnesota. Animal research protocols were approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All animals were housed in microisolator cages to minimize horizontal pathogen contamination. For orthotopic inoculation of MIA PaCa-2-luc cells, mice were anesthetized with 14 \u00a5\u00ecl/g of ketamine/xylazine cocktail (ketamine 6.5 mg/ml, xylazine 0.44 mg/ml). A small 0.5 cm incision was made in the left abdomen and 4 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells were injected orthotopically into the exposed pancreas (1:1 mixture cell:matrigel (BD bioscience, San Jose, CA)) using a 29 gauge needle and a Hamilton syringe. In some experiments, dye was injected with cells in extra mice to confirm that cells were not leaking from the injection site. The peritoneum was then closed with dissolvable suture and the skin incision closed with wound clips (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL). The effect of dEGF4KDEL against the MIA PaCa-2-luc orthotopic tumors was measured using bioluminescent imaging in real time. Mice were imaged every week to monitor the level of luciferase activity and tumor progression. Images were captured using the Xenogen IVIS 100 imaging system and analyzed with Living Image 2.5 software (Xenogen Corporation, Hopkington, MA). During imaging, mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane gas. All mice received 100\u00a5\u00ecl of a 30 mg/ml D-luciferin aqueous solution (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis MO) IP 10 minutes before imaging to provide a substrate for the luciferase enzyme. All images represent 5 minutes exposure time and all regions of interest (ROI) are expressed in units of photons/sec/cm 2/sr. For in vivo studies, athymic nude mice were injected orthotopically (OT) with 4 million MIA PaCa-2-luc cells on day 0 to initiate tumors and given 3?4 ug of dEGF4KDEL/ IP injection. For Experiment 1, a single course of treatment was one injection given every other day (MWF). Treatment began on day 5 and mice were given 9 weekly courses of dEGF4KDEL IP of about 4 \u00a5\u00ecg/injection. In experiment 2, mice were treated using a different schedule. A single course of drug treatment was 2 injections given every day (MTWTh). Treatment began on day 3 and mice were given 3ug/injection with 7 courses. In experiment 3, a single course of treatment was 1 injection given every day (MTWTh). Treatment began on day 5 and mice were given 4 ug/injection for 7 weekly courses. Bioluminescent images were carried out to monitor the response to treatment every week. If weight loss was detected, an injection was occasionally reduced or skipped. Histology. Mice from in vivo experiments were sacrificed after bioluminescent imaging for histologic evaluation. For histology, myocardial perfusion was performed. Following this, tissues were removed and embedded in OCT compound (Miles, Elkhark, IN), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at ?80\u00a1\u00c6C until sectioned. Sections were cut, thawed, and mounted on glass slides and fixed for 5 minutes in acetone. Slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E). Statistical analyses. All statistical analysis was performed using Prism 4 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Groupwise comparisons of single data points were made by Student\u00a1\u00afs t-test. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. Results. Potency and specificity of EGF4KDEL and dEGF4KDEL. EGF4KDEL was column purified to a purity of 95% (not shown) and then tested against the EGFR+IL-4R+ human pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2. The MIA PaCa-2 cell line was chosen because it grows well in nude mice and orthotopic injection always results in pancreatic cancer and liver metastasis. Figure 2 shows that bispecific EGF4KDEL (with an IC 50 of 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 ?7 nM) was at least 2 logs more effective in inhibiting the proliferation of MIA PaCa-2 in vitro than its monospecific counterparts. Also, EGF4KDEL was at least 2 logs more effective than an equimolar mixture of monospecific EGFKDEL and cpIL4KDEL indicating that the superior effect was dependent on positioning both ligands on the same single chain molecule. In order to determine whether EGF and IL-4 ligands bound to EGFR+ IL4R+ target cells, recombinant EGF4 devoid of toxin was synthesized and added to wells containing 1 nM of EGF4KDEL and MIA PaCa-2 target cells (Figure 3). The addition of EGF4 blocked the ability of EGF4KDEL to kill target cells. In other studies, both anti-EGF and anti-IL-4 antibodies blocked EGF4KDEL activity indicating that both ligands were individually active (25, 26). In Figure 4A, dEGF4KDEL was tested against EGFR+IL-4R+ SW1990 human pancreatic cancer cells in proliferation assays. dEGF4KDEL was highly inhibitory with an IC 50 of 10 ?5 nM, while irrelevant control targeted toxin CD3CD3KDEL had minimal effect. In Figure 4B, deimmunized EGF4KDEL was compared to non-mutated parental EGF4KDEL against another pancreatic cancer S2VP10 cell line. The mutated drug displayed an IC50 of 10 ?9 nM and the activity of the two drugs was identical. Activities were similar when mutated and non-mutated drug were also compared against the MIA PaCa-2 and SW1990 cell lines (not shown). Together, these data indicate the drugs were potent and highly selective against pancreatic carcinoma cells. Also, mutation of toxin did not have any effect on activity of the drug. Efficacy in an aggressive orthotopic pancreatic cancer model. To determine whether deimmunized drug could mediate a systemic anti-pancreatic cancer effect, a model was developed in which MIA PaCa-2 cells transfected with a luciferase reporter gene were surgically injected into the pancreas of nude mice. In all three experiments shown in Figure 5, animals received the same number of MIA PaCa-2 cells by OT injection. All drug treatments were 3?4 \u00a5\u00ecg/injection by IP injection. In Figure 5, Experiment 1, animals were treated with a single course of drug at 4ug/injection given every other day (MWF) beginning on day 5. Mice were given a total of 9 weekly courses of treatment. The individual data from all animals M8?M11 show a marked reduction of tumor over time in 4 of 5 treated mice as determined by a reduction in total bioluminescence activity. These animals survived long-term (172 days) and animals M8 and M10 were tumor-free survivors. Tissues were examined for the presence of metastatic cancer using standard histology techniques and tumor cells could not be detected. In contrast, untreated controls (M1?M7) mostly progressed. In Figure 5, Experiment 2, tumor-bearing mice were treated with deimmunized drug using a different schedule. A single course of drug treatment was two 3 ug injections given every day (MTWTh) beginning on day 3. Mice were given a total of 7 weekly courses. The results were similar with regressions in 4 of 6 treated mice. Mice M34?M37 were still tumor free after 67 days as determined by histology analysis. The experiment was repeated in Figure 5, Experiment 3. This time animals were treated on MTWTh with a single IP injection of drug (4 ug/injection) beginning on day 5. Again mice were treated with 7 weekly courses. In four of 5 treated animals tumors regressed, but all animals relapsed by day 54. Figure 6 shows the average tumour-associated luciferase activity from animals in each group of the mice in Experiment 1, measured by plotting total bioluminescent activity over time. The data are plotted for the 4 animals that responded to drug. A group of 3 mice were given deimmunized 2219ARLKDEL as a control since it only recognizes B cells. Tumor growth paralleled that observed in the untreated controls. Taken together, these data show that deimmunized drug is highly effective and selective against systemic human pancreatic cancer and the best results were observed with extended treatment with drug. Because imaging indicated that mice M8?M11 that were treated with dEGF4KDEL were tumor-free on day 172, histology studies of liver, kidney, spleen, and pancreas were performed. M8 was studied for histology on day 201 and was tumor free (data not shown). For Experiment 2, mice M35 and M37 were tumor free three weeks after the completion of the experiment by the image results. Despite the extended treatment, the M35 histology panel in Figure 5 reveals a normal hepatic lobule and no inflammation around the portal vein signifying a healthy liver. The M37 histology panel figure shows a healthy pancreas including a healthy lobular exocrine duct (right) and islet of Langerhans (left). Histology studies were also performed on mice with OT tumors that were not treated. The histology panel of mouse M25 pancreas revealed a small area of inflammatory infiltrate containing tumor cells. The histology panel of mouse M26 showed advanced pancreatic infiltration by the tumor cells and deterioration of the pancreatic architecture. This correlated with the imaging data which showed a focus of bioluminescent activity. \u00a1\u00b0Reduced immunogenicity\u00a1\u00b1 of dEGF4KDEL. To decrease the immunogenicity of EGF4KDEL, B-cell epitopes on the PE38(KDEL) portion were mutated. Immunization studies with immunocompetent BALB/c mice were conducted to compare the immunogenicity of deimmunized EGF4KDEL to the parental EGF4KDEL molecule. Mice (n=5/group) were immunized weekly for a total of 9 weeks. Serum samples from each animal were analyzed using ELISA to detect anti-PE38(KDEL) IgG. Figure 7 shows that mice injected with the original EGF4KDEL agent showed a steady increase in anti-toxin levels as more injections were given. The levels of anti-toxin antibody also rose for dEGF4KDEL, but at a reduced rate. Despite multiple immunizations, levels of anti-toxin were significantly reduced with the administration of deimmunized drug (p<0.05). Discussion. The original contribution of this paper is that a BLT called dEGF4KDEL simultaneously targeting EGFR and IL-4R had striking effects against systemic human pancreatic cancer in an orthotopic nude mouse model. Despite the metastatic nature of the MIA PaCa-2 orthotopic tumor xenografted in nude mice, high percentages of the tumors responded resulting in a significant anti-cancer effect and disease free survivors. Multiple injections of dEGF4KDEL were tolerated and a therapeutic window exists despite the reactivity of human EGF with the native receptors in the mouse. Different regimens were tested and all showed some degree of efficacy, but we were unable to conclude that one regimen was better than another. However, our data in total does indicate that deimmunized drug is highly effective and selective against orthotopic pancreatic cancer and extending treatment is important in obtaining long-term survivors. The BLT had greater activity than its monospecific forms and studies with mixtures of the monomeric forms, EGFKDEL and IL4KDEL, showed that the enhanced activity was dependent on having both ligands on the same single chain molecule. Activity was selective because negative controls did not cause an anti-cancer effect. The drug was highly effective against three different pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. The relevancy of targeted toxins has been rightfully criticized because of their diminished potency, immunogenicity, and toxicity. However, genetic engineering shows great potential to address all of these issues. To enhance potency, our laboratory used a drug framework permitting simultaneous delivery of targeted toxin with dual ligands. Our first constructs used anti-B cell scFVs and were based on the work of Herrera (27) that showed advantages of combining anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 based drugs to promote activity. Our studies showed that BLTs were superior to the monospecific forms and to mixtures of these monospecific drugs indicating the importance of positioning both ligands on the same single chain molecule as the toxin. In subsequent studies, we found that cytokine ligands could be substituted for scFV ligands to target carcinomas and that EGF and IL-4 ligands showed enhance potency in targeting aggressive carcinomas including breast and lung cancer (25, 26). To address the issue of toxin immunogenicity, the toxin moiety was \u00a1\u00b0deimmunized\u00a1\u00b1 without compromising its activity. The clinical efficacy of treatment with targeted toxins against solid tumors hinges on the ability to give multiple treatments (25). Anti-toxin responses will be generated that significantly reduce drug efficacy over time causing problems in two ways. 1) Neutralizing antibodies block drug efficacy (28) and 2) Non-neutralizing antibodies bind to drug and accelerate clearance, negatively impacting its pharmacokinetics (29, 30). Onda and Pastan used a library of anti-PE monoclonal antibodies to epitope map prominent molecular region, which elicited the strongest antibody response from immunized B cells (18). PE was mapped into seven epitope regions. We constructed our PE-based BLT and mutated key amino acids in these 7 regions without compromising toxin activity. The anti-toxin response was significantly reduced in a validated mouse model (25). We are continuing to search for additional immunogenic amino acids that will further reduce immunogenicity. A key question is: Is the mouse an acceptable model to study the immunogenicity of PE? To address this, investigators asked whether treatment with PE immunotoxins induces human antibody responses to the same immunogenic epitopes recognized by mice. Sera was taken from 8 patients in phase 1 trials with pancreatic, colon cancer, or mesothelioma treated with two different PE immunotoxins LMB-9 (anti-CD25 PE) (31) or SS1P (anti-mesothelin PE) (32). These patients had developed neutralizing antibodies that prevented further drug administration. Serum samples were analyzed in a published assay and most patients with solid tumors produced neutralizing Abs after one cycle of immunotoxin treatment (33). Competition analysis of paired serum samples showed that before treatment, the sera contained almost no specific Ab to any of the PE38 epitopes. In contrast, the sera obtained after immunotoxin treatment contained anti-PE38 Abs to every epitope recognized by the mouse antisera as shown by their ability to inhibit the binding of the corresponding mAbs to each epitope (17). These results show that human immunotoxin treatment induces human Abs against the same 7 immunogenic epitopes identified by the mouse mAb panel. Toxicity is still a major concern. Clinically, other targeted toxins were limited by renal or hepatic toxicity (34, 35). Although we have observed dermatological effects of EGFR-containing BLT in nude mice (23), a finding in agreement with the known reactivity of EGF with EGFR in the skin (36), human IL-4 does not bind to murine IL-4R. Thus, mouse is not the best model for predicting toxicity in humans. Studies are underway to evaluate toxicity in an \u00a1\u00b0ontarget\u00a1\u00b1 macaque model. Toxicity may be reduced in macaques by the higher molecular weight of the bispecific drug that might prevent kidney filtration and extend serum half-life. Regarding the issue of whether genetic engineering can be used to reduce toxicity, a study was recently undertaken using this same orthotopipc pancreatic cancer model in which the objective was to determine whether a method could be developed to block normal receptors while still targeting receptors over-expressed on cancer cells thereby decreasing toxicity while maintaining efficacy (37). A large bolus IP dose of genetically engineered EGF13 (devoid of toxin) was administered to mice about 15?20 minutes prior to DTEGF13, also given IP. Thus, the MTD was exceeded by 10?15 fold while still maintaining efficacy against systemic orthotopic pancreatic cancer in nude mice. Such an approach might be useful in this model as well. Generally, the potency of BLTs is elevated over monospecific forms. However, sometimes EGF4KDEL is 1000 fold more active than either single ligand toxin EGFKDEL or IL4KDEL (25), and sometimes it is only marginally more active than a single ligand toxin (26). We believe the explanation is complex and influenced by more than one variable including the recognition and binding of two sets of receptors by the BLT, variances in receptor expression by the target cell, and differences in internalization by BLT versus single ligand toxins. Finally, it is well established that different targeted toxins compartmentalize differently within cells. For example, it is known that some are more prone to enter lysosomes and undergo degradation and some arrive rapidly to the cytosolic compartment to inhibit protein synthesis (38). In conclusion, dEGF4KDEL represents a new anti-pancreatic cancer agent. Its bispecific construction is based on molecules that react with well-studied and established cancer targets, IL-4R and EGFR. In vitro studies show conclusive proof that the presence of both ligands on the same molecule is responsible for its superior activity. Possibly, the broader bispecific reactivity and lack of immunogenicity will be an advantage over earlier monospecific targeted toxins designed for use in pancreatic cancer (12). Our animal studies indicate that dEGF4KDEL is highly effective in checking aggressive tumor progression and reasonably well tolerated. Deimmunized EGF4KDEL may be a useful alternative therapy for pancreatic cancer and other types of EGFR+ carcinomas as well. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "K-Ras mutation-mediated IGF-1-induced feedback ERK activation contributes to the rapalog resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas\tMammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is frequently activated in human cancers; however, clinical trials of rapalog (the mTORC1 inhibitors) have shown that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) resist to the treatment. Rapalog treatment activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in K-Ras mt PDAC cells. K-Ras knockdown abolished the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-induced ERK pathway in the K-Ras mt PDAC cells and enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of everolimus in treating K-Ras mt PDAC cells-derived mouse xenografts. The results indicate that targeting of K-Ras mutation may lead to the development of therapies that overcome rapalog resistance in PDAC. 1. Introduction. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related protein kinase family [1] has recently emerged as a cancer therapeutic target [2]. mTOR exists in two distinct functional complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 controls protein translation through phosphorylation and activation of its substrates, p70S6 ribosomal kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein (4E-BP1) [3]. Once phosphorylated, 4E-BP1 dissociates from eIF4E whereas p70S6K phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6, thus promoting mRNA translation [3]. The defining component of mTORC1 is the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (RAPTOR) that regulates mTORC1 assembly and recruitment of its kinase substrates [4]. Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic that can remove RAPTOR from mTORC1 and thus inhibits mTORC1 phosphorylation of its substrates [5]. This mTORC1 pathway is activated in many cancers and drives cancer progression [6]. The rapamycin analogs everolimus (RAD001), temsirolimus (CCI-779) and ridaforolimus (AP23573) have therefore been developed as cancer therapeutic agents [7; 8]. In phase III trials, single-agent everolimus and temsirolimus prolonged overall survival of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma [9; 10], mantle cell lymphoma [11] and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor [12]. In phase II trials, however, the single-agent therapies have had limited clinical activity against glioblastomas [13], advanced melanomas [14], breast cancers [15; 16] and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) [17; 18]. The molecular basis of rapalog resistance in these cancers is currently under intensive investigation. mTORC1 acts as a central integrator for upstream inputs from growth factors, nutrients and stress [19]. Growth factors such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) can activate mTORC1 through their cognate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated phosphorylation and activation of PI3K and Akt [19]. Akt phosphorylates its substrates tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) and proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa (PRAS40), thus releasing their inhibition of mTORC1 [20; 21]. The growth factors can also signal mTORC1 through Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway [22]. The Ras-ERK pathway consists of Ras GTPase and the protein kinases Raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase (MEK) and ERK. RTK-mediated activation of the Ras GTPase leads to the activation of these kinases through phosphorylation loops: Raf activates MEK, MEK activates ERK and ERK activates p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) [22]. Both ERK and RSK phosphorylate the mTORC1 inhibitor TSC2 [23; 24] and ERK phosphorylates RAPTOR [25], thus promoting the activation of mTORC1. This growth factor-mTORC1 pathway is regulated through two negative feedback loops: mTORC1-S6K-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) [26; 27] and mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (Grb10) [28]. Through these negative feedback loops, rapalogs inhibit mTORC1 and activate PI3K [18; 29; 30; 31] and ERK in cancers [32], resulting in cancer resistance to the treatment. Ras GTPases are coded by the human H-Ras, K-Ras and N-Ras genes. K-Ras, but not H-Ras or N-Ras, is frequently mutated in nearly 95% human PDACs [33]. Mutant (mt) K-Ras proteins exhibit constitutive GTPase activity [34] and thus contribute to the development and progression of PDAC [35]. Here, we show that K-Ras mutations play a critical role in the rapalog resistance in PDAC. K-Ras mutations contribute to the rapalog-induced feedback activation of IGF-1-Ras-Raf-ERK pathway and inhibition of the mt K-Ras abolishes the feedback ERK signal, reduces the rapalog resistance and thus enhance inhibitory effect of rapalog on the growth of K-Ras mt PDAC cells-derived mouse xenografts. 2. Materials and Methods. 2.1. Human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, tissues and normal pancreatic tissues. Human PDAC cell lines, BxPC-3, Capan-2, Hs 766T, and PANC-1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). BxPC-3 was grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); Capan-2 in McCoy 5\u00a5\u00e1 medium (Invitrogen); and Hs 766T and PANC-1 were in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). Human PDAC and normal pancreatic tissue samples were collected in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of the First Hospital of Jilin University. These tissues were surgically removed from patients diagnosed with PDAC, snap-frozen and stored at ? 80\u00a1\u00c6C. 2.2. Reagents and antibodies. Everolimus (RAD001) and sorafenib from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 20 mM and stored in aliquots at ?80\u00a1\u00c6C. NVP-AEW541 (hydrochloride) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI) and dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 10mM and stored in aliquots at ?80\u00a1\u00c6C. Recombinant human IGF-1 (rhIGF-1) was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). From Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) were the antibodies to 4E-BP1, phospho-4EBP1 (p-4E-BP1; Ser37/46), Akt, p-Akt (Ser473), p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), green fluorescent protein (GFP), p-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221), mTOR, p-mTOR (Ser2448), p70S6K, p-p70S6K (Thr389), ribosomal protein S6 (S6), p-S6 (Ser235/236), and p-RSK (Ser380). Actin and K-Ras antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Jackson IR Laboratories (West Grove, USA). 2.3. PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen tissues and cell cultures by using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. cDNA was synthesized using 2\u00a5\u00ecg of total RNA with SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis using oligo (dT) primer System following the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). Aliquots of the reaction mixture were used for the subsequent PCR amplification. The primer sequences for KRAS amplification were: sense: 5'-GACTGAATATAAACTTGTGGTAGTTGGACCT-3' and antisense: 5'-TCCTCTTGACCTGCTGTGTCG-3'. The sense primer was designed to introduce a base substitution that created a BstNI recognition site for the WT codon 12 (GGT), but not for codon 12 with the KRAS mutation. PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00a1\u00c6C for 5 m; 30 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 s, annealing at 58\u00a1\u00c6C for 60 s and extension at 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 s; followed by final extension at 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 10 m. PCR products were digested with BstNI (New EnglandBiolabs) at 60\u00a1\u00c6C for 2 h, and were visualized using a 2% agarose gel documentation system (Bio-Rad). 2.4. Cell viability assay. Cells were seeded and grown in 96-well plates at 8\u00a1\u00bf10 3 cells per well in 100\u00a5\u00ecl of growth medium for 24 h based on the protocol [36]. Cells were then treated or untreated for 48 h with everolimus and sorafenib, alone or in combination. Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline and 100 \u00a5\u00ecl buffer containing 0.2 M sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 20 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added to each of the well. The plates were incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 1.5 h and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 \u00a5\u00ecl 1M NaOH to each well and the color developed was measured at 405 nm by a microplate reader (BioRad). 2.5. Colony formation assay. Cells in single-cell suspension were plated and grown in 6-well plates at a density of 1000 cells per well for 24 h. Cells were then treated or untreated with everolimus and sorafenib, alone or combination. The medium was replaced every 3 d with fresh medium containing the corresponding agents. After 12 day treatment, the medium was removed and cell colonies were stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution. 2.6. Flow cytometric analysis and BrdU labeling. Cells were synchronized by serum starvation by growing cells in medium without serum for 2 days and then released into the cell cycle by adding 10% fetal bovine serum to the medium. The cells were untreated or treated with 10nM everolimus for 20 h, harvested, fixed with 70% ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide. The data were acquired using a flow cytometry (FACSCanto II Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NY, USA) and were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). BrdU pulse labeling was performed by synchronizing cells as described above. After release, the cells were exposed to BrdU (10\u00a5\u00ecM) for 20 h using a FITC BrdU Flow Kit based on the manufacturers' protocol (BD Pharmingen), then fixed and permeabilized by paraformaldehyde and saponin. After DNA was denatured using DNase, BrdU labeling was detected using a FITC conjugated antibody to BrdU. 2.7. RNA interference. For a vector-based RNA interference, double-stranded short hairpin RNA (shRNA) clones specifically targeting of K-Ras gene were purchased from the Mission TRC 1.0 Library (Sigma): TRCN0000010369, TRCN0000040148, TRCN0000040149, TRCN0000040152, and TRCN0000018337. MISSION vector non-target shRNA (SHC002) was used as an empty vector control. To produce shRNA lentivirus, each of the shRNA plasmids and Lentiviral Packaging Mix (Sigma, SHP001) were co-transfected into 293T cells using Fugene (Roche). After 3 day incubation, viral supernatants were isolated and passed through a 0.45-\u00a5\u00ecm cellulose acetate filter. For determination of knockdown efficiency, cells were transduced and selected for 10 days in 1 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL puromycin (Sigma) and the total protein were extracted for western blot. Two shRNA clones with the best knockdown efficiency were selected for further experiments. The K-Ras knockdown PANC-1 cells were then transiently transfected either with 2 \u00a5\u00ecg of p-EGFP control vector or p-EGFP/K-Ras G12D using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After 24 h, the efficiency of transfection was tested by fluorescent microscopy of GFP. The transfected cells were examined for the expression of K-Ras G12D in western blot using GFP antibody and used for experiments. 2.8. Western blot and immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes; the membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C with the primary antibodies, at room temperature for 1 h with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed by chemiluminescence. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were collected using 1% triton x-100 buffer and were incubated overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C in a rotator with 5\u00a5\u00ecl of c-Raf antibody or rabbit IgG as a negative control. Then 40 \u00a5\u00ecl of protein G agarose (Invitrogen) was added and incubated with constant shaking at 4\u00a1\u00c6C for another 4 hr. The beads were then gently spun down and fully washed three times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 2\u00a1\u00bf loading buffer, then boiled and separated the protein from the beads and analyzed by western blot. 2.9. Mouse subcutaneous xenografts and treatments. The animal studies were approved by Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The empty vector and K-RAS shRNA expressing PANC-1 cells (7 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6) were injected subcutaneously into the flank region of four to six-week old (about 20 g of body weight) female athymic (nu/nu) mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY). The mice were allowed to develop subcutaneous xenografts and tumor volumes were measured using calliper measurements. When tumors reached 150?200 mm 3, mice were assigned randomly to two experimental groups (n = 6/group) and treated either with saline (control) or everolimus (4 mg/kg/day, via oral gavages). Tumor volumes were measured once every 3 days and calculated based on the formula: V =4/3 \u00a1\u00bf \u00a5\u00f0 \u00a1\u00bf (length / 2 \u00a1\u00bf (width / 2) 2). After a 21-day treatment, the mice were sacrificed. The tumors were then removed and weighed. Some of the tumors were submerged in 10% neutrally buffered formalin for immunohistochemistry and others were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein extraction. 2.10. Immunohistochemistry. Five-micron thick paraffin sections were deparaffinised and rehydrated in deionized water. The sections were exposed to 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 minutes before incubation anti-p-ERK and p-S6 antibody at 1:50 overnight, following the approach as earlier reported [37]. The slides were then stained with secondary antibody using the R.T.U. Vectastain kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The slides were then exposed to 3,3'-diaminobenzidine chromogen for 5 minutes, and hematoxylin counter staining for 5 minutes. 2.11. Statistical analysis. All data were presented as means \u00a1\u00be SE. Statistical analyses were done by using GraphPad Prism version 5.01 software programs for Windows (GraphPad Software). The difference in means between two groups were analysed with two-tailed unpaired Student's t ?test. Results were considered to be statistically significant at P <0.05. 3. Results. 3.1. K-Ras mt PDAC cells are resistant to everolimus treatment. K-Ras mutations [33] and mTORC1 activation [37] has been shown in PDAC tissues. In exploring the correlation between K-Ras mutations and mTORC1 activation, we examined these in PDAC tissues surgically removed from patients. The most common K-Ras mutation occurs at codon 12 in PDAC tissues [33] and we confirmed this mutation in four of five PDAC tissues by PCR-RFLP analysis (Fig. 1A). In examining mTORC1 activation, we extracted total proteins from the tissues and analyzed the extracts by western blotting using antibodies against S6 and p-S6, one of the substrates of mTORC1 downstream p70S6K [3]. The expression of S6 protein was consistent in PDAC and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues tested. In contrast, western blotting revealed an increase of p-S6 protein in PDAC as compared to normal pancreatic tissues (Fig. 1B). The expression of p-S6 protein was detected in both K-Ras wild type (wt) and mt PDAC tissues. Immunohistochemistry further confirmed the presence of p-S6 protein in both K-Ras wt and mt PDAC tissues (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate mTORC1 activation in PDAC tissues without correlation with K-Ras mutation in the tissues. To examine the role of K-Ras mutation in PDAC resistance to rapalog, we selected PDAC cell lines that carry wt (BxPC-3, Hs776T) or mt K-Ras (Capan-2, PANC-1). K-Ras mutation in codon 12 was confirmed in Capan-2 and PANC-1 by PCR-RFLP analysis (Fig. 2A). Each of the cell lines was treated with everolimus in a series of dilutions for 48 h and cell viability assay showed that the K-Ras mt cell lines, Capan-2 and PANC-1, were resistant to the everolimus treatment as compared to the K-Ras wt BxPC-3 and Hs776T cell lines (Fig. 2B). Cell lines were then treated with 10 nM everolimus for 20 h and examined by flow cytometry to assess cell cycle (Fig. 2C). The treated cells were also examined by colony formation assay (Fig. 2D). The results showed that the everolimus treatment led to a significant increase in G1 phase in the K-Ras wt BxPC-3 and Hs776T but not the K-Ras mt Capan-2 and PANC-1 lines (Fig. 2E). Colony formation assay further revealed that the everolimus treatment significantly reduced the number of K-Ras wt cell lines, but not mt cell lines (Fig. 2F). The results suggest that everolimus treatment inhibits the cell cycle progression in K-Ras wt PDAC cells. In contrast, K-Ras mt PDAC cells are resistant to the treatment. 3.2. Everolimus treatment activates Ras-ERK pathway in K-Ras mt PDAC cells. To define the molecular basis of the everolimus resistance in K-Ras mt PDAC cells, we first examined whether everolimus treatment inhibited mTORC1 pathways in K-Ras mt PDAC cell lines as compared to K-Ras wt PDAC cell lines. Both K-Ras wt and mt PDAC cell lines were treated or untreated with 10 nM everolimus for 1 h. The cells were then lysed and examined by western blotting for the presence of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated proteins that are known to be part of the mTORC1 pathway. The everolimus treatment significantly reduced the levels of the phosphorylated proteins in mTORC1 pathway: p-mTOR, p-p70S6K and p-S6 in both the K-Ras wt BxPC-3 and Hs776T and K-Ras mt Capan-2 and PANC-1 cell lines (Fig. 3A). The results indicate that the inhibition of mTORC1 by everolimus shuts down the phosphorylation loops of mTORC1 and downstream kinases in K-Ras wt and mt PDAC cells. Of the two downstream kinases, S6 and 4E-BP1, the everolimus treatment inhibited S6, but not 4EBP1 in the PDAC cell lines, consistent with the reports that rapalogs differentially inhibit S6K and 4E-BP1 in the different types of cells [38; 39]. Next, we determined whether everolimus treatment activates Ras-Raf-ERK pathway in K-Ras mt PDAC cell lines. The everolimus treated or untreated PDAC cell lines were examined by western blotting for the presence of the phosphorylated proteins that are known to be in the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway, in which Ras interacts with c-Raf/Raf-1 and thus activates the phosphorylation loops [22]. The results showed that the everolimus treatment led to an increase in the levels of the phosphorylated proteins of Ras-Raf-ERK pathway: p-c-Raf, p-MEK, p-ERK and p-RSK in the K-Ras mt Capan-2 and PANC-1 but not K-Ras wt BxPC-3 and Hs766T cell lines (Fig. 3B), which correlates everolimus-induced Ras-Raf-ERK activation with K-Ras mutation in PDAC cells. To confirm this, we treated the K-Ras wt BxPC-3 and mt PANC-1 cell lines with everolimus in a series of dilutions for 1 h. Western blotting revealed that the everolimus treatment led to the increase of p-c-Raf, p-MEK, p-ERK and p-RSK proteins in a dose dependent manner in the K-Ras mt PANC-1 but not K-Ras wt BxPC-3 cell line (Fig. 4A). Next, we determined whether everolimus treatment enhances the interaction of mt K-Ras and c-Raf for the Ras-Raf-ERK activation. The everolimus treated and untreated K-Ras mt PANC-1 cells were immunoprecipitated using c-Raf antibody and western blotting using K-Ras antibody revealed the increased interaction of mt K-Ras and c-Raf protein in the everolimus treated PANC-1 cells (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results suggest that everolimus treatment inhibits mTORC1 but activates Ras-Raf-ERK pathway in K-Ras mt PDAC cells. Rapalog treatment activates PI3K/Akt pathway in human cancers and thus leads to treatment resistance [29; 40]. We sought to determine whether the rapalog-activated PI3K/Akt contributed to the rapalog resistance in K-Ras mt PDAC cells. The everolimus treated K-Ras wt and mt PDAC cell lines were examined by western blotting and the results revealed an increase in the levels of p-Akt proteins in both K-Ras wt and mt PDAC cell lines (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the everolimus-induced PI3K/Akt feedback loop does not contribute directly to the rapalog resistance in K-Ras mt PDAC cells. 3.3. Sorafenib reduces the rapalog resistance in K-Ras mt PDAC cells. Sorafenib is an multi-kinase inhibitor of c-Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, 2, 3 (VEGFR-1,2,3), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u00a5\u00e2 (PDGFR-\u00a5\u00e2), c-kit and Flt-3 and it has been approved for clinical treatment of renal and hepatocellular carcinomas [41]. The Rasraf-ERK pathway is activated in K-Ras mt PDAC cells and, thus, we sought to determine whether, by inhibiting c-Raf-ERK pathway, sorafenib could release the rapalog resistance in K-Ras mt PDAC cells. K-Ras wt and mt PDAC cell lines were treated for 1 h with 10 nM everolimus and 3 \u00a5\u00ecM sorafenib, alone or in combination. The sorafenib treatment inhibited the ERK pathway in both the K-Ras wt BxPC-3 and mt PANC-1 cell lines as evidenced by the decrease of p-MEK, p-ERK and p-RSK in the cell lines in western blot analysis (Fig 5A). In the combination with everolimus, sorafenib eliminated everolimus-induced ERK pathways in the K-Ras mt PANC-1 cells. In addition, western blotting showed that everolimus inhibited mTORC1 pathway, alone or in combination with sorafenib in the K-Ras mt PANC-1 cells (Fig. 5A). The cell lines were then treated with the same doses of sorafenib and everolimus, alone or in combination, for 48 h and cell viability assay showed that the sorafenib treatment alone did not inhibit the growth of either the K-Ras wt BxPC-3 or K-Ras mt PANC-1 cells; however, in the combination, sorafenib significantly reduced the resistance of the K-Ras mt PANC-1 cells to the everolimus treatment (Fig. 5B). The cell lines were then treated with sorafenib and everolimus for 10 days and colony formation assay showed that the combination treatment of sorafenib and everolimus significantly reduced the size and number of the K-Ras mt PANC-1 cells (Fig. 5C,D). These results suggest that the combination of sorafenib and everolimus synergistically inhibits the growth of K-Ras mt PDAC cells through the simultaneous inhibition of mTORC1 pathway and everolimus-induced ERK pathway. 3.4. K-Ras mutation contributes to the everolimus-induced ERK signaling. Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits c-Raf and other RTKs [41]. To specifically define the role of mt K-Ras, we took a knockdown approach using two K-Ras specific shRNA sequences. The shRNA sequences and empty vector as control were introduced, respectively into PDAC cell lines through lentiviral infection. Western blotting revealed the knockdown of both wt and mt K-Ras protein in the K-Ras wt BxPC-3 and K-Ras mt PANC-1 cell lines (Fig. 6A). The K-Ras shRNA expressing PDAC cell lines were treated with everolimus and cell viability assay showed that the knockdown of wt K-Ras did not affect the response of the K-Ras wt BxPC-3 cells to everolimus treatment (Fig. 6B). In contrast, however, knockdown of mt K-Ras significantly reduced the resistance of the K-Ras mt PANC-1 cells to everolimus (Fig. 6C). The shRNA and empty vector expressing cells were synchronized for 2 days in the FBS-free culture conditions. The cells were then released from the synchronization by adding 10% FBS in the culture medium and exposed to 10 nM everolimus and 10 \u00a5\u00ecM BrdU for 20 h. Examination of the BrdU incorporation revealed that K-Ras knockdown significantly inhibited the BrdU labelling in the everolimus-treated K-Ras mt PANC-1 cells (Fig. 6D) but no such a effect was seen in the everolimus-treated K-Ras wt BxPC-3 cells (Fig. 6E). Finally, K-Ras shRNA-expressing cells were treated with 10 nM everolimus for 1 h and examined by western blotting. The results showed that K-Ras knockdown significantly reduced the everolimus-induced ERK activation, as evidenced by the decrease of p-c-Raf, p-MEK and p-ERK in the K-Ras mt PANC-1 cell line (Fig. 6F). K-Ras shRNA knocks down both wt and mt K-Ras and, therefore, to confirm the role of mt K-Ras, the K-Ras shRNA knockdown PANC-1 cells were transfected with GFP tagged p-EGFP/K-Ras G12D. The expression of mt K-Ras G12D was confirmed by western blot using a GFP antibody, resulting in the restoration of the everolimus-induced ERK activation (Fig. 6G). Taken together, these results indicate that one mechanisms by which K-Ras mutation contributes to the rapalog resistance is through its activation of ERK pathway in PDAC cells. Targeting of mt K-Ras blocks the everolimus-induced ERK negative feedback loop and thus enhances everolimus inhibition of cell cycle progression of K-Ras mt PDAC cells. 3.5. IGF-1 mediates everolimus-induced EKR activation through mt K-Ras. K-Ras oncoproteins couple the RTKs of growth factors to the Raf-ERK pathway [42]. To further examine the role of mt K-Ras in this pathway, we grew K-Ras mt PANC-1 cell line in serum-free culture conditions supplemented with growth factors, an experimental approach that allows to examine growth factor-RKT pathway [28]. The cells grown in the serum-free culture conditions were treated or untreated first with 10 nM everolimus for 1 h and then 100 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), IGF-1 or 10% FBS as control for 15 min. The cells were examined by western blotting and the results showed that everolimus treatment inhibited the mTORC1 pathway in the cells grown under all of these culture conditions (Fig. 7A). In addition, everolimus treatment enhanced the ERK activation in the presence of 10% FBS and IGF-1 but not EGF, FGF2, or HGF (Fig. 7A); the results suggest that everolimus-induced ERK feedback loop occurs through IGF-1 signaling pathway. Very recently, Ebi et al. have reported that K-Ras is an activator of the ERK pathway and RKTs are the regulators of the PI3K pathway in K-Ras mt colorectal carcinoma cell lines under serum culture condition [43]. To confirm the role of IGF-1, K-Ras mt PANC-1 cells were treated with NVP-AEW541, the IGF-1 receptor inhibitor, alone or in combination with everolimus for 8 h under our no serum culture conditions. The results showed that the treatment of NVP-AEW541 significantly reduced the IGF-1-mediated feedback activation of ERK and Akt (Fig. 7B). To further examine the role of mt K-Ras, the experiment was repeated in the K-Ras shRNA and empty vector-expressing K-Ras mt PANC-1 cells. Everolimus treatment activated ERK pathway in the empty vector-expressing PNAC-1 cells in the presence of IGF-1 (Fig. 7C left) and stimulated the cells growth (Fig. 7D, left). In contrast, everolimus treatment inhibited mTORC1 without the ERK activation in the K-Ras shRNA expressing PANC-1 cells (Fig. 7C, right) and thus inhibited the cell growth (Fig. 7D, right). These results suggest that mt K-Ras is required for the everolimus-induced feedback loop of IGF-1-induced ERK pathway. Targeting of mt K-Ras eliminates the feedback loop and thus enhances the inhibitory effect of everolimus on the growth of K-Ras mt PDAC cells. 3.6. Everolimus inhibits the growth of mt K-Ras knockdown PDAC cells-derived xenografts. The in vitro experiments above have proved the principle that mt K-Ras contributes to the rapalog resistance through the activation of IGF-1-ERK feedback loop in K-Ras mt PDAC cells. To examine this in vivo, we generated mouse subcutaneous xenografts from the K-Ras shRNA and empty vector expressing K-Ras mt PANC-1 cells. Once the subcutaneous xenografts formed, mice were randomized and treated either with everolimus (4 mg/kg/day) through oral gavages in the experimental group or saline in the control group every day for twenty-one days. The size of subcutaneous xenografts were measured every three days and the results showed that everolimus treatment significantly reduced the volumes of the xenografts derived from the K-Ras shRNA expressing PANC-1 as compared with the empty vector-expressing PANC-1 cells (Fig. 8A, B). The xenografts were removed and total protein was extracted. Western blotting confirmed the K-Ras knockdown and the inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway in the everolimus treated xenografts of the K-Ras shRNA expressing PANC-1 cells (Fig. 8C). The xenografts were also embedded in paraffin blocks and paraffin sections were examined for ERK activation using antibody to p-ERK. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of p-ERK protein in the xenografts derived from the empty vector but not shRNA expressing PANC-1 cells (Fig. 8D), indicating that knockdown of mt K-Ras inhibits the ERK activation in the xenografts. In contrast, the everolimus treatment enhanced p-ERK activation in the xenografts derived from empty vector but not in shRNA expressing PANC-1 cell lines. Taken together, these results indicate that targeting of mt K-Ras can eliminate the everolimus-induced ERK feedback loop and thus enhances the therapeutic efficacy of everolimus in treating K-Ras mt PDACs through its inhibition of mTORC1 pathway. 4. Discussion. PDAC is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Surgical resection of primary PDAC remains the only potential cure; unfortunately, however, the majority of PDACs are presented at advanced states. Current standard gemcitabine therapy and radiotherapy improve survival of patients with advanced PDAC only for up to a few months [44; 45]. In the last decade, novel therapeutic agents have been developed targeting cancer core pathways. mTORC1 pathway is activated in human cancers [1] and thus rapalogs have been developed to target the pathway for cancer therapies [2]. The mTORC1 activation has been reported in PDAC tissues [37]; however, clinical trials have failed to show antitumor activity of rapalogs in treating PDAC patients [17; 18]. By examining K-Ras wt and mt PDAC cells in culture and xenografts, we show here that rapalog treatment activates IGF-1-mediated Ras-Raf-ERK pathway through mt K-Ras, resulting in the rapalog resistance in K-Ras mt PDAC cells. Ras-ERK pathway is commonly dysregulated in PDACs and targeting of this pathway may lead to the cure of the cancers [35]. Ras activation requires the post-translational modification of its C-terminal with a farnesyl isoprenoid lipid catalyzed by farnesyl transferase (FTase) [42]. Phase II or III trials, however, have shown a limited anti-PDAC activity of tipifarnib, a FTase inhibitor [46; 47] and sorafenib, a Raf inhibitor [48; 49], alone or in combination of gemcitabine. In accordance with these clinical findings, we show here that the treatment of sorafenib alone inhibits ERK but not mTORC1 pathway and the inhibition of ERK pathway alone fails to control the growth of both K-Ras wt and mt PDAC cells. K-Ras mt PDAC cells resist everolimus treatment. However, by inhibiting the Ras-Raf-ERK feedback loop, sorafenib treatment can reduce rapalog resistance in mt K-Ras PDAC cells and thus enhance the inhibition effect of rapalog on cell growth. The study suggests that the combination of sorafenib and everolimus may provide potential therapy in treating PDAC where K-Ras mutation is nearly universal [35]. The results presented here show that mTORC1 pathway is activated in both K-Ras wt and mt PDAC tissues and cell lines. K-Ras wt PDAC cells respond moderately to rapalog treatment. In contrast, K-Ras mt PDAC cells are resistant to this treatment. These findings suggest the role of mt K-Ras in rapalog resistance, consistent with observations in clinical trials of rapalog treatment of human PDACs that harbour K-Ras mutation [17; 18] and studies of K-Ras G12D engineered mouse ovarian and colonic cancers [50; 51]. Recent studies have identified two negative feedback loops in the mTORC1 signaling pathway and suggest these feedback loops may be responsible for rapalog resistance. The mTORC1 pathway is negatively regulated by mTORC1-S6K-IRS [26; 27] and mTORC1-Grb10 feedback loops [28]. By inhibiting mTORC1, rapalogs shut down these two negative feedback loops and thus activate PI3K/Akt pathway in normal and cancer cells [29; 30; 31]. Genetic ablation of mt K-Ras in cancer cells restores the cell response to the rapalog treatment through inhibition of rapalog-induced feedback activation of PI3K pathway [31]. In addition, prolonged rapamycin treatment seems to inhibit mTORC2 assembly and the Akt pathway [52]. These studies are therefore in accordance with the recent report that the dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 inhibits the xenograft growth of primary pancreatic cancers [53]. Examination of the tumor samples from patients treated with everolimus has shown ERK activation for the first time [32]. In this study, we further show that the rapalog treatment activates ERK pathway in K-Ras mt PDAC cells. Knockdown of mt K-Ras blocks the rapalog-induced ERK signal, reduces the rapalog resistance, and thus enhances the therapeutic efficacy of rapalog in treating the mouse xenografts generated from K-Ras mt PDAC cells. IGF-1 activates mTORC1 through its RTK-mediated ERK phosphorylation and ERK-mediated inhibition of the mTORC1 inhibitors, TSC2 and RAPTOR in normal cells [22]. Recently, IGF-1 axis gene polymorphisms [54] and protein expressions [55] have been associated with the PDAC risk and aggressiveness. The results presented here further show that rapalog-induced ERK activation occurs through the IGF-1 signaling pathway and mt K-Ras is required for the rapalog-induced IGF-1-ERK activation and thus contributes to the rapalog resistance in K-Ras mt PDAC. In conclusion, the findings presented here provide the rationale for a combination of K-Ras and mTORC1 inhibitors in the treatment of PDAC where K-Ras mutations are nearly universal. K-Ras mutations contribute to rapalog-induced feedback activation of IGF-1-ERK pathway and thus targeting of mt K-Ras blocks the feedback ERK signal, reduced rapalog resistance and thus enhances therapeutic efficacy of rapalogs in treating human PDAC. New cancer therapeutic agents are indeed currently under development for the combination therapies that simultaneously target the multiple core pathways in cancers [8]. Acknowledgments.

Using the NCI anticancer drug screen data, we identified two compounds from the thiosemicarbazone family that manifest increased growth inhibitory activity in mutant p53 cells, particularly for the p53 R175 mutant. Mechanistic studies reveal that NSC319726 restores WT structure and function to the p53 R175 mutant. This compound kills p53 R172H knock-in mice with extensive apoptosis and inhibits xenograft tumor growth in a 175-allele specific mutant p53 dependent manner. This activity depends upon the zinc ion chelating properties of the compound as well as redox changes. These data identify NSC319726 as a p53 R175 mutant reactivator and as a lead compound for p53 targeted drug development. INTRODUCTION. TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer with mutation frequencies ranging from 38?50% in some reports to as high as 75% and 96% in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and high grade serous ovarian carcinomas respectively (Hingorani et al., 2005; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; Petitjean et al., 2007). The majority of mutations are mis-sense mutations that occur most frequently in six \u00a1\u00b0hotspot\u00a1\u00b1 codons within the DNA binding domain (Olivier et al., 2010). These mutant proteins are classified as either DNA contact mutants (e.g. p53 R273H) when the mutation occurs in a DNA binding residue, or conformational mutants (e.g. p53 R175H) when a conformational change causes a loss of WT p53 DNA binding. Mutant p53 proteins are found at high concentrations in tumor cells relative to WT p53 mostly due to a loss of WT p53 transcription of the MDM2 gene that negatively regulates p53, as well as other tumor specific alterations such as loss of p16 INK4a (Haupt et al., 1997; Midgley and Lane, 1997; Terzian et al., 2008). The concept that these mutant proteins are functional and regulate important processes relevant to tumor biology is referred to as the mutant p53 gain-of-function (GOF) phenotype (Sigal and Rotter, 2000). Properties attributed to mutant p53 GOF include enhanced tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis (Adorno et al., 2009; Dittmer et al., 1993; Liu et al., 2000; Muller et al., 2009). Taken together, these properties make mutant p53 an attractive target for drug development. The NCI anticancer drug screen has reported growth inhibition IC50s on 48,129 compounds tested on a panel of sixty human tumor cell lines (NCI60 screen). Given that the p53 status (WT, null, mutant) of these cell lines is known (Ikediobi et al., 2006; Shoemaker, 2006), we hypothesized this screen could be used to uncover drugs targeting p53 mutant tumors. Thus we developed a methodology to identify compounds with increased activity in a panel of tumor cell lines with p53 mutations, relative to p53 WT controls. In this study, we attempted to validate this methodology using two compounds that belong to the thiosemicarbzone family of metal ion chelators. We further investigated one of the compounds with particular toxicity to cell lines containing a p53 R175 mis-sense mutation; identifying the mechanism of this toxicity and the properties of the compound that are relevant to this mechanism. RESULTS. Identification of thiosemicarbazones with activity in cell lines expressing mutant p53. Our methodology deals with the intrinsic heterogeneities of the NCI60 screen (Figure 1A and Supplementary Methods). This takes as input IC50 data, applies data normalization to obtain a working definition of a good response; and then ranks compounds manifesting a good response using a scoring function. This score function identifies those compounds with an enrichment of good responders in the case group (mutant p53), while simultaneously having a depletion of good responders in the control group (wild-type p53). To reduce the heterogeneity in the mutant p53 group, we focused on mutations in hotspot codons 175, 248 and 273 (11 cell lines), while the control group was composed of sixteen p53 wild-type cell lines. Applying this methodology, we observed three of the highest scoring compounds belonged to the thiosemicarbazone family (NSC319725, NSC319726, and NSC328784) that preferentially inhibited p53 mutant cell lines (Figure 1B). When comparing the IC50\u00a1\u00afs of these compounds by p53 mutational status, we see the low IC50s are enriched of cells with a p53 mutation (Figure 1B, red), while the majority of p53 wild-type cells exhibit high IC50s (Figure 1B, blue). In contrast, two reported mutant p53 reactivators (PRIMA-1, MIRA-1) as well as an additional thiosemicarbazone currently in clinical trials (Triapine) scored poorly using this methodology in comparison to NSC319726 (Figure S1A?D). We validated two of our screened compounds (NSC319725, NSC319726) using a mouse fibroblast cell line containing no functional TP53 gene (10(3)) from which several stable CMV-driven mutant p53 transfectants (175, 248, 273) were derived (Dittmer et al., 1993). Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts were used as a p53 WT control as this is the same background as the 10(3) and its derived cell lines. Both compounds exhibited growth inhibition at markedly lower concentrations in cells expressing mutant p53 as compared to the WT control, particularly in the 175 allele (Figure 1C). The IC50 for the NSC319725 treated 175 mutant was \u00a1\u00c3100 fold lower than the WT. For NSC319726, the effect was even greater as the IC50 for the 175 mutant was 8 nM while the IC50 of the WT was not reached. Similar to the Balb/c 3T3, these two compounds were remarkably nontoxic to WI38 human fibroblasts (p53 WT), as an IC50 for both compounds was not obtained (Figure 1D). Furthermore, NSC319726 did not induce WT p53 protein levels or transcriptional activity as common cytotoxic agents such as etoposide do in vitro (Figure S1E). We further validated NSC319726 employing additional p53 mutant cell line systems. In a set of isogenic MEF cell lines from p53 +/+, p53 ?/? and p53 R172H/R172H mice, we found that NSC319726 exhibited a much higher sensitivity for the MEF-p53 R172H/R172H cell line as compared to the p53 +/+ and p53 ?/? controls (Figure 1E). We compared the sensitivities across human tumor cell lines with different p53 \u00a1\u00b0hot spot\u00a1\u00b1 mutations (175, 248, 273). With the exception of one p53 R175 cell line (RXF393), the 175 cells exhibited similar IC50\u00a1\u00afs that were approximately 10-fold and in some instances 100-fold lower than the other hotspot mutants indicating a 175 allele preference of growth inhibition by NSC319726 (Figure 1F). It is important to emphasize that the results of these assays depend to a significant degree on a number of factors including the method of assaying cell viability, the proliferation rates of the cells, the confluency at the time of drug exposure as well as differences in redox in tumor cells. To diminish intra-assay variability we used the Guava-ViaCount assay to compare the effects of NSC319726 across tumor cell lines that varied by p53 status given the heterogeneity of these cell lines. In both the MTS and Guava-ViaCount assay we found it to be important to have the cells at 50?60% confluency at the time of drug exposure. Cell growth inhibition assays carried out under different conditions can and do give different IC50\u00a1\u00afs. Induction of p53 R175-dependent apoptosis by NSC319726. To determine if the inhibition of cell growth was mediated by apoptosis, we performed Annexin-V staining of different cell lines treated with NSC319726. We observed an increase in the number of Annexin-V stained cells with a maximum increase in the 175 mutant (Figure 2A). Similarly, treatment of three different ovarian carcinoma cell lines (TOV112D (p53 R175H), OVCAR3 (p53 R248W) and SKOV3 (p53 ?/?)) with NSC319726 resulted in an induction of apoptosis in the p53 R175 mutant more than 2-fold higher than the other two mutant cell lines (Figure 2B). When we silenced expression of the p53 R175 mutant protein by si-RNA, we observed a marked reduction in sensitivity to cell growth inhibition, demonstrating that the NSC319726 mechanism is at least partially dependent on the p53 R175 mutant protein (Figure 2C). NSC319726 induction of a \u00a1\u00b0WT-like\u00a1\u00b1 conformational change in the p53 R175 mutant protein. Because NSC319726 induced a p53 apoptotic function in p53 R175 cells, we investigated if NSC319726 restored WT conformation to the mutant p53 R175 protein. Using conformation specific antibodies by immunoflourescence, we observed that NSC319726 induced a conformation change in the p53 R175 mutant to a structure that was recognized by the WT specific antibody (PAB1620) and was no longer recognized by the mutant specific antibody (PAB240) (Figure 3A). Quantification of the fluoresence intensity for PAB240 was reduced by five-fold, while that of PAB1620 was increased by two-fold (Figure 3B). We confirmed this conformation change by PAB240 immunoprecipitation of NSC319726 treated TOV112D lysates indicating a more than 85% decrease in PAB240 immunoreactivity (Figure 3C). Next we sought to confirm this conformation change in an additional cell line. NSC319726 treatment of a MEF cell line derived from p53 R172H/R172H mice resulted in a loss of PAB240 immunoflouresence staining (Figure 3D). The PAB1620 antibody staining is not shown as this antibody is human specific. This demonstrates that the conformation change induced by NSC319726 occurs in both human (p53 R175) and mouse (p53 R172) proteins. Restoration of p53 transactivational function through the \u00a1\u00b0WT-like\u00a1\u00b1 conformational change induced by NSC319726. To determine if the conformation change observed with the p53 R175 mutant resulted in restoration of p53 transcriptional function, we examined p21 protein levels after NSC319726 treatment in TOV112D and SKOV3 cells. We found that NSC319726 induced p21 in the TOV112D cell line but not in the SKOV3 (Figure 4A). Treatment of the TOV112D cells with the DNA damaging agent etoposide failed to induce p21 (Figure 4A). This suggests that the p21 induction in NSC319726 treated TOV112D cells was p53 R175 mutant dependent. We note NSC319726 caused a reduction in the levels of the mutant protein (Figure 4A). We examined this further by measuring the mutant protein levels at different time points over a 24 hour period. Treatment of TOV112D cells with NSC319726 decreased the stabilization of the mutant protein with the lowest levels seen at six hours with a return to pre-treatment levels by 24 hours. This p53 mutant protein destabilization was not seen when we treated two cell lines containing the p53 DNA contact mutants R248 (OVCAR3), and R273 (SW620) with NSC319726. This indicates an allele specificity to the NSC319726 mediated effect on p53 mutant protein levels. We hypothesized that the decrease in p53 R175 protein stability was due to restoration of Mdm2 negative regulation of the \u00a1\u00b0WT-like\u00a1\u00b1 p53 R175 mutant. To test this, we performed this experiment in the presence of Nutlin-3 (small molecule antagonist of Mdm2) and found that Nutlin-3 abrogated the decrease in stability of the p53-175 mutant induced by NSC319726 (Figure 4B). This restoration of Mdm2 negative regulation is the result of transactivation of the MDM2 promoter by the \u00a1\u00b0WT\u00a1\u00b1 like p53 R175 mutant (Figure 4C and 4D). We confirmed the ability of NSC319726 to restore DNA binding properties to the p53 R175 mutant protein by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Using the p53 antibody, DO-1, ChIP analysis of NSC319726 treated TOV112D cells revealed the restoration of site-specific DNA binding of p53 R175 mutant to the promoters of p21, PUMA and MDM2 (Figure 4C). HCT116 cells treated with etoposide as well as RNA polymerase II binding of the GAPDH promoter were used as controls (Figure 4C). We compared the mRNA levels of several p53 targets (p21, PUMA, MDM2) in the TOV112D (p53 R175H), OVCAR3 (p53 R248W) and SKOV3 (p53 ?/?) cells upon treatment and found that NSC319726 increased the levels of all three p53 target genes in TOV112D cells, particularly the apoptotic gene PUMA (Figure 4D). To provide further evidence that NSC319726 restored site-specific p53 transactivational function we transfected the TOV112D cells with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing 20 base pairs of the p53 response element in the p21 promoter. NSC319726 treatment induced a 2.5 fold increase in luciferase activity that was not seen in MEF cells expressing the 248 and 273 alleles, indicating that the restoration of transcriptional function is allele specific (Figure 4E). We next utilized gene expression microarrays to examine the transcriptional activity of a larger cohort of p53 targets in TOV112D cells. NSC319726 treatment produced a p53 target expression signature remarkably different from the untreated controls, confirming that the conformation change of the p53 R175 mutant results in a transcriptionally active protein (Figure 4F). Table S1 reports the average expression log 2-ratios between cells treated with NSC319726 and untreated controls, focusing on probes that map to p53 target genes. The list of p53 targets were selected from a literature review, providing a comprehensive list of experimentally verified targets of p53 (Riley et al., 2008). In vivo allele-specific p53 R175H mutant reactivation by NSC319726. To investigate the p53 mutant reactivation in vivo we performed toxicity assays in p53 +/+, p53 ?/? and p53 R172H knock-in mice (Lang et al., 2004). We hypothesized that p53 R172H mice would experience greater toxicity for a given dose of NSC319726 as compared to p53 +/+ mice. By day 3 of treatment (10 mg/kg/day), all seven of the p53 R172H/R172H mice had died while only 1/9 p53 +/+ mice had died. By day 4, the survival of the p53 +/+ mice was 70% while the survival of p53 +/R172H was 30%, suggesting a clear dosage effect that is dependent on the TP53R175 genotype (Figure 5A). Next we lowered the dose to 5mg/kg and found that by day seven, the p53 +/+ and p53 ?/? mice exhibited a 100% survival compared to only 30% of the p53 R172H/R172H mice (Figure 5A). We examined the tissues of p53 +/+ and p53 R172H/R172H mice after treatment for evidence of apoptosis as well as gene expression of a panel of p53 targets. We detected abundantly more apoptotic cells in the sections of the spleen and thymus of p53 R172H/R172H mice as compared with the p53 +/+ controls (Figure 5B). We also detected elevated mRNA levels of a number of p53 targets in a tissue specific fashion in the p53 R172H/R172H mice as compared with the p53 +/+ controls, most notably in the lung, spleen, thymus and small intestine (Figure 5C). We tested the ability of NSC319726 to inhibit the growth of xenograft mouse tumors derived from human tumor cell lines carrying different p53 alleles. At a dose of 1mg/kg, tumor growth of the H460 (p53 +/+) and MDAMB468 (p53 R273W) xenografts was not inhibited relative to the vehicle control whereas tumor growth was significantly inhibited in the TOV112D (p53 R175H) xenografts (Figure 5D). When we lowered the dose ten-fold to 0.1 mg/kg in the TOV112D mice, we observed only a small difference in tumor growth inhibition demonstrating both a dosage effect of the drug and a larger therapeutic window. Taken together, these findings provide in vivo evidence for allele specific p53 mutant reactivation. Zinc ion chelation and redox changes are important for the NSC319726 mediated p53 R175 reactivation mechanism. Thiosemicarbazones are metal ion chelators with strong affinity for iron, copper, and zinc (Yu et al., 2009). They have been investigated as anticancer agents and have been shown to inhibit DNA synthesis by inhibiting the iron dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RR), but at much higher concentrations than are employed to inhibit the growth of p53 R175 mutant cells. To determine if the metal ion chelating property of NSC319726 is important to its p53 R175 mutant activity we added NSC319726 to TOV112D cells in the presence of various concentrations of FeSO 4. We found that FeSO 4 at concentrations above 15 \u00a5\u00ecM completely abrogated the activity of NSC319726. At concentrations below 15 \u00a5\u00ecM, the activity of NSC319726 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6A). We suspected iron was not the relevant metal ion as iron is not associated with the p53 protein and the treatment of the TOV112D cells with another iron chelator, desferrioxamine (DFO), had no apoptotic effect (Figure S2A). However, zinc is required for proper folding of WT p53, and the 175 mutant is classified as a non-zinc binding mutant because it fails to coordinate zinc (Butler and Loh, 2003; Joerger and Fersht, 2007). When we added NSC319726 to TOV112D cells in the presence of different concentrations of ZnCl 2, we found that there was an optimal zinc concentration range (5?15 \u00a5\u00ecM) in which the activity of NSC319726 increased 2-fold (Figure 6B). We did not test higher concentrations over 100 \u00a5\u00ecM of ZnCl 2 in combination with NSC319726 because we found that concentrations above 100 \u00a5\u00ecM of ZnCl 2 (by itself) were toxic to cells. This toxicity was independent of p53 status (Figure S2B?C). Another property of thiosemicarbazones is their effect on the redox state of the cell. Thiosemicarbazone:Fe complexes cause oxidative stress by the creation of hydroxyl radicals through Fenton chemistry (Kalinowski and Richardson, 2007; Richardson et al., 2009; Richardson et al., 2006). This is relevant to the mechanism of NSC319726 as redox changes have been reported to influence WT p53 folding (Hainaut and Milner, 1993a). In support of this, we observed a statistically significant decrease in the levels of the cellular reductant glutathione upon NSC319726 treatment of TOV112D cells at 1, 3 and 24 hours (Figure 6C). To determine the importance of these redox changes to the activity of NSC319726 we treated TOV112D cells in the presence of the reducing agent N-acteyl-cysteine (NAC) and the oxidizing agent diamide. We found that 5mM NAC inhibited the apoptotic activity of NSC319726 while diamide (100 \u00a5\u00ecM) enhanced it (Figure 6D). These data suggest that ROS changes are important for the apoptotic mechanism of NSC319726 on p53 R175 mutant cells. DISCUSSION. The reactivation of p53 in mouse tumor models has been shown to be a highly effective therapeutic strategy (Martins et al., 2006; Ventura et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2007). Several small molecules have been claimed to reactivate mutant p53, including CP-31398, WR-1065, PRIMA- 1 and MIRA-1 (Bykov et al., 2002; Bykov et al., 2005; Foster et al., 1999; North et al., 2002). With the exception of one compound, WR1065, all have been identified using traditional chemical screens (Bykov et al., 2002; Bykov et al., 2005). Traditional chemical screens favor the use of matched case/control cell lines derived from the same parental cell line, engineered such that the case cell line carries the molecular alteration under consideration. This can be a fundamental caveat, since cancers are known to be heterogeneous in nature. Here we demonstrate our methodology to screen for compounds manifesting increased sensitivity in a panel of cell lines carrying p53 mutations independently of their diverse genetic backgrounds and cell type specificity, which is a more realistic model of what is observed in the clinic. Applying this methodology to the NCI60 screen we identified three compounds from the thiosemicarbazone family. Follow up experiments with two of these compounds (NSC319725 and NSC319726) corroborated the predicted p53 mutant specific growth inhibitory properties. It is possible that this methodology could be used to identify compounds with increased sensitivity in tumor cell lines carrying mutations in other major oncogene/tumor suppressor pathways. It is important to note that cell viability assays in Figure 1C and the apoptosis assays in Figure 2A indicate that there is an apoptotic mechanism that is independent of p53 mutational status (null, mis-sense mutant). What initiates this apoptosis is unclear but may be related to either an increase in ROS levels or ribonucleotide reductase (RR) inhibition, two reported mechanisms of action for thiosemicarbazones. Non-tumor cell lines with a WT p53 gene (Balb/c 3T3, WI38) showed relatively little to no growth inhibition by NSC319726 at these same doses, which would argue against the inhibition of RR as the explanation. If increased ROS levels are the reason, we speculate that this apoptosis may be due to the inability to compensate for these oxidative changes in a cell lacking a functional p53 transcription factor. In distinction, the mechanism of apoptosis in a p53 R175 mutant cell is dependent on the mutant p53 R175 mutant protein. NSC319726 treatment induces a WT-like conformational change in the p53 R175 mutant protein that restores sequence-specific p53 transcription. This is best observed in the in vivo experiments employing both knock-in p53 mutant mice and xenografts. We have demonstrated that the metal ion chelating properties of NSC319726 are required for the mutant p53 mediated apoptotic activity. Interestingly, metal ion chelation has been shown to induce p53 conformational changes (Hainaut and Milner, 1993b; Yu et al., 2009). The fact that the 175 mutant fails to bind zinc and that zinc chloride at low concentrations (5?15 \u00a5\u00ecM) enhances the activity, leads us to hypothesize that NSC319726 may serve as a source of zinc to allow the 175 mutant to refold. Such a metallochaperone function was demonstrated for another zinc chelator, Nitriloacetate, which facilitated refolding of the p53 WT DNA binding domain (that was previously unfolded by removing the zinc) (Butler and Loh, 2007). Further biophysical studies are needed to confirm this. Structural studies of the p53 DNA binding domain indicate that the zinc ion is coordinated by four amino acids (C176, H179, C238 and C242) (Cho et al., 1994; Joerger et al., 2005; Wong et al., 1999). Mutations in any of these residues result in the inability to coordinate zinc. In contrast, the R175H mutant is not directly involved in zinc binding. It is generally believed that a histidine residue at this location induces structural distortions in the protein that prevent it from binding zinc (Joerger and Fersht, 2007). If the metallochaperone hypothesis is correct then it is plausible that NSC319726 may reactivate other zinc binding mutants. The question of what activates mutant p53 to become a better transcription factor and induce an apoptotic mechanism after a WT conformational change is an important one. Most likely this is due to the elevated oxidative state in the mutant p53 cell. This oxidative state is the result of the combination of NSC319726 treatment and elevated ROS levels in p53 mutant cells (due to loss of p53 mediated regulation of the redox state) (Sablina et al., 2005). In support of this is the observation that an oxidizing agent, diamide, enhances the apoptotic activity of NSC319726, while NAC inhibits it. While inhibition of RR activity is a known mechanism of action of thiosemicarbazones, we feel this is unlikely involved in the p53 R175 reactivation mechanism because 1) the drug is completely nontoxic to human fibroblasts at the IC90 for p53 R175 mutant cells and 2) the dose that inhibited p53 R175 mutant xenograft tumor growth was completely nontoxic to mice. The doses we used in our mouse toxicity experiments were considerably higher however, and RR inhibition may explain some of the toxicity observed in WT mice. NSC319726 is an attractive lead compound for drug development for three reasons: 1) in vivo p53 R175 mutant reactivation can be observed at doses that are nontoxic to WT animals, 2) the compound exhibits a wide therapeutic window when given intravenously and 3) the target (p53 mutant protein) is found at high levels in cells. The pool of potential patients for such a drug would be fairly large given the fact that the 175 mutant is the third most commonly found p53 mis-sense mutant, making up an estimated 5.5% of all mis-sense mutants (Olivier et al., 2010). Using the IARC TP53 database (http://www-p53.iarc.fr/), we estimate the annual incidence in the United States of cancer patients carrying the TP53 R175 allele to be more than 32,000. Our findings support the growing trend in Developmental Therapeutics in which the efficacy of future cancer drugs will depend upon the knowledge of the patient\u00a1\u00afs tumor genotype.

The list of p53 targets were selected from a literature review, providing a comprehensive list of experimentally verified targets of p53 (Riley et al., 2008). Measurement of level of Glutathione. The levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) are measured using the GSH-Glo Glutathione Assay, according to the manufacture\u00a1\u00afs instruction (Promega). Mouse experiments. Mice are housed and treated according to guidelines and all the mouse experiments are done with the approval of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. The mice with p53 R172H/+ are a gift of Dr. Lozano (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas). The nude mice NCR nu/nu are purchased from Taconic. For the toxicity assays, 6?10 week old mice are of the following genotypes, p53 R172H/R172H (n=8), p53 R172H/+ (n=8), p53 +/+ (n=9) and p53 ?/? (n=3). Mice are treated with either NSC319726 at 10mg/kg or 5mg/kg or vehicle control (DMSO) by intraperitoneal injection daily for up to 7 days, followed by harvesting the mouse tissues. Xenografts tumor assays are derived from the human tumor cell lines, TOV112D, H460 and MDAMB468 (6\u00a1\u00bf10 6 cells/mouse). Tumor dimensions are measured every other day and their volumes are calculated by length (L) and width (W) by using the formula: volume = L\u00a1\u00bfW 2\u00a1\u00bf\u00a5\u00f0/6. Tumors are allowed to grow to 60 mm 3 prior to daily intravenous administration of NSC319726 at 1 mg/kg or 0.1mg/kg (TOV112D only). The following number of animals were used, H460 (Control-5, Treatment-5), MDAMB468 (Control-9, Treatment-8), TOV112D (Control-7, Treatment 1mg/kg-7, 0.1 mg/kg-7). The experiment was repeated two to three times with similar results. Highlights. Significance. The next generation of anticancer drugs will be defined by compounds that selectively kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells undisturbed. We developed an in-silico screening methodology that identified such a compound that selectively kills cancer cells with a p53 R175 mutation. The mechanism of action restores WT structure and function to the p53 R175 protein using its zinc-chelating and redox properties. This unique mechanism may allow medicinal chemistry to design other compounds that renature other p53 mutants that fail to coordinate zinc. TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer, and the p53 R175 mutant is the third most frequently found mis-sense mutant. The potential pool of patients in the United States for this drug would approximate 32,000 annually. Supplementary Material. 01. 02. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

                "text": "Aggressiveness of human melanoma xenograft models is promoted by aneuploidy-driven gene expression deregulation\tMelanoma is a devastating skin cancer characterized by distinct biological subtypes. Besides frequent mutations in growth- and survival-promoting genes like BRAF and NRAS, melanomas additionally harbor complex non-random genomic alterations. Using an integrative approach, we have analysed genomic and gene expression changes in human melanoma cell lines (N=32) derived from primary tumors and various metastatic sites and investigated the relation to local growth aggressiveness as xenografts in immuno-compromised mice (N=22). Although the vast majority (>90%) of melanoma models harbored mutations in either BRAF or NRAS, significant differences in subcutaneous growth aggressiveness became obvious. Unsupervised clustering revealed that genomic alterations rather than gene expression data reflected this aggressive phenotype, while no association with histology, stage or metastatic site of the original melanoma was found. Genomic clustering allowed separation of melanoma models into two subgroups with differing local growth aggressiveness in vivo. Regarding genes expressed at significantly altered levels between these subgroups, a surprising correlation with the respective gene doses (>85% accordance) was found. Genes deregulated at the DNA and mRNA level included well-known cancer genes partly already linked to melanoma (RAS genes, PTEN, AURKA, MAPK inhibitors Sprouty/Spred), but also novel candidates like SIPA1 (a Rap1GAP). Pathway mining further supported deregulation of Rap1 signaling in the aggressive subgroup e.g. by additional repression of two Rap1GEFs. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of SIPA1 exerted significant effects on clonogenicity, adherence and migration in aggressive melanoma models. Together our data suggest that an aneuploidy-driven gene expression deregulation drives local aggressiveness in human melanoma. INTRODUCTION. Melanomas account for 4 to 5% of all cancers and represent currently the 6 th leading cancer type in the USA [1]. While 80% of melanomas are diagnosed at localized stages, one third of those early stage patients will develop metastatic disease associated with dismal prognosis, i.e. a median overall survival of 6 to 8 months [2]. Recent discoveries have markedly improved our understanding of the molecular changes underlying malignant progression of melanomas including mainly alterations in proliferation, survival and cell death signaling pathways [3-5]. The RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT are two major signaling pathways constitutively activated in up to 90% of melanomas. While BRAF mutations represent the most frequent oncogenic alteration in melanomas so far (BRAF V600E in up to 70% of cases), NRAS mutations occur in 15 to 30%. Recently, exon sequencing approaches revealed additional mutations in individual members of the MAP3K and MAP2K families including MEK1 and MEK2. The AKT/mTOR pathway might be additionally activated mainly by loss-of-function mutations or deletions of the inhibiting phosphatase PTEN. Furthermore, typical impairment of senescence due to mutations, deletions or methylation of p16 INK4/CDKN2A occurs in 30 to 70% of melanomas. Oncogenic proteins in melanoma include e.g. members of the bcl-2 protein family, cyclin D1, and several transcription factors like the lineage-specific oncogene MITF (for detailed reviews on these molecular changes see [6-8]). Improving the knowledge on major drivers underlying development and aggressiveness of melanoma is of strong interest to identify clinically and therapeutically relevant patient subgroups. However, achievement of this goal is hampered by strong heterogeneity not only at the genomic level, but also with regard to phenotypic, histopathological, and clinical characteristics. Accordingly, multiple studies from different scientific disciplines have suggested the existence of several melanoma subtypes that may arise through several different causative pathways [9]. At the molecular level, besides (in)activating mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, development of melanoma is characterized by complex karyotypic changes leading to multiple and severe gene dose alterations. Several lines of evidence suggest that this aneuploidy might represent an additional driving force of malignant transformation and cancer progression [7, 9]. It can be assumed that the observed molecular heterogeneity drives at least to some extent disease pathogenesis, clinical behavior, and possibly response to therapy, and that genomic aberrations and gene dose-related RNA alteration patterns might even dictate disease behavior [7]. Accordingly, clustering of 80 metastatic lesions based on genomic alteration profiles resulted in three subgroups that could not be related to their location, but, when intersected with clinical outcome, one subgroup displayed a significant survival advantage, indicating that the clustering could be biologically relevant [7]. In this study, we aimed to analyze genomic and transcriptomic alterations in human melanoma cell cultures (originating from primary as well as metastatic lesions) classified with respect to their in vivo growth characteristics. Using this approach, we demonstrated that genomic aberrations allow clustering of primary melanoma cell lines according to their in vivo growth behavior. Interestingly, genes differentially expressed in subgroups with differing aggressiveness closely reflected corresponding gene dose alterations. This suggests that melanoma malignancy is at least partly driven by aneuploidy-mediated gene expression deregulation. The affected genes comprised several known oncogenes and tumor-suppressors. However, also novel candidates like SIPA1, a Rap1GTPase, were identified as important drivers of melanoma aggressiveness. Accordingly, by using a siRNA approach, this Rap1-deactivating protein was proven to regulate clonogenicity and cell adhesion/migration of aggressive melanoma cell models. RESULTS. Human melanoma xenograft models are characterized by distinctly differing aggressiveness. In an initial approach, 11 human cutaneous melanoma cell models were xenografted subcutaneously into immuno-compromised nu/nu mice and primary tumor growth as well as metastasis to the lungs, the liver and the brain investigated. While all cell lines were tumorigenic, distinct differences in aggressiveness became obvious (Figure ?(Figure1A).1A). Five cell models were characterized by rapid growth with two showing spontaneous metastasis to the lung (Figure ?(Figure1B).1B). In contrast, the other 6 melanoma models, though all tumorigenic, were much less aggressive and no signs of local or distant metastases could be detected. Growth behaviour was confirmed in the SCID mouse system (data not shown). Tumorigenicity in vivo did not reflect the growth characteristics of the cell models in vitro regarding minimal doubling time (data not shown and [10]). This suggests that specific tumor cell characteristics and/or interactions with the microenvironment are the major determinants causing the significant differences of tumor aggressiveness in vivo. Genes differentially expressed in fast- versus slow-growing melanoma models are non-randomly distributed along the chromosomes. In order to determine cellular factors driving in vivo tumor aggressiveness, whole-genome gene expression arrays were performed. The 11 melanomas were subgrouped into \u00a1\u00b0fast-growing\u00a1\u00b1 and \u00a1\u00b0slow-growing\u00a1\u00b1 models according to xenotransplant growth dynamics (compare Figure ?Figure1A)1A) in order to extract differentially expressed genes (Student\u00a2\u00a5s t-test p<0.01, 428 oligonucleotide probes representing 323 genes). When allocating this set of probes to the chromosomal arms, a strikingly non-random distribution was detected (Figure 2A,B). First, when comparing the proportion of significantly changed probes per arm with that of all oligonucleotides represented on the microarray, chromosome arms with distinct enrichment of altered gene expression in fast- versus slow-growing melanomas became obvious (Figure ?(Figure2A).2A). Hotspots were chromosomes 2, 10, 11 and 22 as well as 17p and 19p arms. Also the direction (up- or down-regulation) of the significant gene expression changes was non-randomly distributed along the chromosomes (Figure 2B,C). Thus, for example altered genes on chromosomes 10, 2p, and 22 were almost generally expressed at lower levels in the fast-growing subgroup (39/41; 25/25; 18/18, respectively). In contrast, on chromosome 11 all but one concerned oligonucleotides (47/48) indicated a significantly higher expression in the aggressive melanoma subgroup (Figure ?(Figure2C).2C). Taken together these data suggest that genomic/chromosomal alterations might have a direct impact on the gene expression pattern associated with in vivo aggressiveness of human melanoma models. Genomic gains and losses but not mRNA expression patterns cluster with aggressiveness in xenotransplantation models. Based on the striking non-random association of genome-wide gene expression with chromosomal regions, we decided to perform array CGH analyses to investigate genome-wide changes in gene copy numbers. All melanoma models exhibited multiple chromosomal changes involving the classical characteristics of human melanoma cells like gains in chromosomes 6p, 7 and 20 as well as losses in 9p, 10 and 14. Array CGH data for the three representative melanoma models VM-4, VM-7 and VM-24 are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. A summary of array CGH data for all 11 melanoma models based on GISTIC analysis is presented in Figure ?Figure3A3A (upper panel). When comparing genomic changes in fast- versus slow-growing melanoma cell models by GISTIC (Figure ?(Figure3A,3A, middle and lower panel), several differences appeared. While the p16/ARF locus at chromosome 9p was equally lost in both subgroups, deletions at the PTEN locus at 10q were more pronounced in the aggressive melanomas. Moreover, more extended losses of chromosome 10 and gains of chromosomes 20q and parts of 11q characterised the aggressive melanoma models. In contrast, losses in 6q were more apparent in the less aggressive subgroup. In order to find out whether genomic changes and/or mRNA expression levels in melanoma models indicate histological origin and/or tumor type, we performed unsupervised cluster analyses on array CGH (Figure ?(Figure3B)3B) and gene expression data (Supplementary Figure S2). Concerning genomic alterations, clustering of melanoma models reflected neither the histological origin nor the metastatic site, but - with one exception ? growth aggressiveness in vivo. This was in contrast to the gene expression analyses, where no association with aggressiveness in the mouse models could be found. Upon closer inspection of those genomic regions differing significantly (p<0.001) in gene dose between the two subgroups of melanomas, again a strong prevalence of selected chromosomal arms became visible with a focus on changes in chromosomes 2, 6, 10, 11 and X (Figure ?(Figure3C3C). Genomic alteration signature predicts aggressiveness of melanoma xenograft models. To test whether the genomic signature of the original 11 melanoma models allows prediction of aggressiveness in further melanoma models, genomic DNA isolated from 21 additional melanoma primary cell cultures was analysed by array CGH. As a first strategy, unsupervised clustering using the complete array CGH data set was performed in all 32 melanoma models (Figure ?(Figure4A).4A). Again the previously identified fast-growing cell models tended to cluster together in subgroups (solid-lined boxes) including also novel melanoma models. Consequently, we chose three additional cell models clustering with the fast- and two with the slow-growing subgroup (broken lined boxes in Figure ?Figure4A)4A) and tested them for tumor growth in SCID mice. Indeed, a strong difference was found within this \u00a1\u00b0validation set\u00a1\u00b1 with VM-8, VM-14 and VM-15 being highly aggressive while VM-44 formed slow-growing tumors and VM-54 was not tumorigenic within the time period of analysis (Figure ?(Figure4B).4B). In a second approach, we aimed to develop a less complex \u00a1\u00b0genomic signature\u00a1\u00b1 from the original 11 melanoma models. Consequently, a highly stringent analysis at the single probe level extracting those probes differing between the two subgroups with a p<0.0005 (Student\u00a2\u00a5s t-test) was performed. This resulted in 62 probes representing 50 annotated gene loci (termed \u00a1\u00b0CGH-identifier\u00a1\u00b1) (Supplementary Table S2). Cluster analyses of all available 32 melanoma models with this CGH-identifier led to formation of two distinct subgroups termed cluster A and B (Figure 4C,D). Consistent with unsupervised clustering results, cluster A (N=13) contained all five fast-growing and cluster B (N=19) all six slow-growing members of the original 11 melanoma models. Of the additional 21 models, 9 grouped in cluster A and 12 in cluster B including correct allocation of the 5 melanoma models used as validation set (compare Figure ?Figure4B).4B). The growth dynamics of these melanoma clusters in SCID mice (Fig. ?(Fig.4E)4E) clearly reflected the highly significant difference in tumor growth between the two subgroups. These data indicate that a defined set of chromosomal changes can predict in vivo aggressiveness of human melanoma cells. Significant gene expression differences between fast- versus slow-growing melanoma models are reflected by gene dose alterations. Next we re-evaluated gene expression differences between the melanoma subgroups at higher stringency (p<0.005; Student\u00a2\u00a5s t-test). This analysis resulted in 191 probes representing 180 differentially expressed genes. Figure ?Figure55 depicts expression changes of these genes (log2 of fold-change, black dots in Figure ?Figure5A)5A) plotted for the most informative chromosomes along the mean array CGH aberration scores (log2) for fast- versus slow-growing melanoma subgroups (red and blue lines, respectively, in Figure ?Figure5A).5A). A surprisingly good reflection of the expression levels by gene copy numbers was observed for the majority of genes. Only 15.4 % of all 191 significantly changed probes at the mRNA level did not correspond to a respective change at the DNA level. Interestingly, these few genes were mainly localised on three chromosomes/arms, namely 1p, 21q, and X. In contrast, the vast majority or even all significant expression changes at several chromosomal arms were reflected by DNA dose both in terms of gains and losses, like chromosome 2 (29/32 agreeing), chromosome 6 (9/9 agreeing), chromosome 10 (18/19 agreeing), chromosome 11 (28/28 agreeing) and chromosome 17 (14/15 agreeing). This again indicates that large scale gains/losses at several specific chromosomal regions are involved in driving local aggressiveness of melanoma xenograft models. Gene expression differences between fast- versus slow-growing melanoma models suggest alterations in cellular growth and differentiation networks. Next we analysed expression array data by in silico pathway prediction approaches for genes expressed differentially between the 8 fast - and 8 slow-growing models (including the original 11 models and the 5 models of the validation set) (Student`s t-test, p<0.05). This resulted in the identification of 2165 altered probes, which were imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Regarding biological functions this approach suggested beside \u00a1\u00b0cancer\u00a1\u00b1 also both \u00a1\u00b0dermatological\u00a1\u00b1 and \u00a1\u00b0neuronal diseases\u00a1\u00b1. Altered networks involved Ras and negative MAPK regulators like Sprouty (Spry) and Spred proteins as well as Ras/Rap/Rab GTPase protein families, suggesting deregulation of these gene products to contribute significantly to melanoma model aggressiveness in vivo (Supplementary Figure S3A,B). Genes altered at gene dose and expression level between fast- versus slow-growing melanoma models: SIPA1 as example. To identify factors underlying the predictive power of genomic alteration patterns, we aimed to investigate the reflection of gene expression changes in the corresponding gene doses. In order to extract genes or pathways from the genomic signature which determine the observed aggressiveness, again two approaches were followed. First, those genes altered at both the DNA and mRNA level were evaluated with comparably low stringency (genomic level: p<0.01; expression level p<0.05). This analysis resulted in the selection of 116 probes, which were predominantly located on chromosomal regions 11q12-q14, 10p, and 6q. Pathway identification using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software revealed several significant pathways involving regulators of GTPases like Rap1 (SIPA1, a RapGAP protein, and RapGEF2) (Supplementary Figure S4), which pointed toward a significant impact of Rap1 deregulation on melanoma model aggressiveness in vivo. In a second approach the evaluation was repeated at higher stringency (genomic level: p<0.005; expression level p<0.005). This approach resulted in only 18 probes/genes that were highly significantly changed both on DNA and mRNA levels (Supplementary Table S3). Within this set of genes, six were expressed at lower levels in the aggressive melanoma models, 5 of which were localized on chromosome 10. Genes expressed at higher levels were predominantly (9 of 12 oligonucleotides) located on chromosome 11q13. In order to validate the genes with the highest significance, real-time PCR experiments for three selected genes were performed. Statistically significantly increased expression of SIPA1 and NUS1 in the fast-growing melanoma subcluster was confirmed, while down-regulation of DNAJC1 was also seen in this analysis but did not reach significance (Figure ?(Figure5B5B). Gene expression analysis did not only indicate significant overexpression of the Rap1-inactivating protein SIPA1 in the aggressive subgroup, but also down-regulation of two RapGEFs and trends towards increased levels of further RapGAP molecules (Figure ?(Figure6A).6A). Collectively, these data suggest that Rap1 deactivation might represent a key characteristic of locally aggressive melanoma models. To further test the validity of our integrative approach, we chose SIPA1 which exhibited the strongest alteration among the Rap1-regulatory genes. SIPA1 protein overexpression in fast-growing melanoma cell models was confirmed in vitro and in vivo (Figure 6B,C). siRNA-mediated gene knock-down (Figure ?(Figure6D)6D) resulted in significantly enhanced cell adhesion capacity in the fast-growing SIPA1-positive melanoma cell model VM-1 (Figure ?(Figure6E,6E, \u00a1\u00b0fast\u00a1\u00b1). In contrast, no significant impact was detected in the slow-growing, SIPA1-low melanoma model VM-28 (Figure ?(Figure6E,6E, \u00a1\u00b0slow\u00a1\u00b1). Furthermore, clonogenic potential and cell migration capacity were reduced by SIPA1 blockade in the aggressive melanoma cell line (Figure 6F,G) while VM-28 cells were almost incapable of migrating through the pores of the trans-well chambers within 48 h (Figure ?(Figure6G6G). DISCUSSION. Melanoma cells constitutively harbor - besides well-defined mutations in certain proto-oncogenes like BRAF and NRAS - also non-random genomic alterations reflecting chromosomal instability (CIN) [11, 12]. Furthermore this non-random aneuploidy has been suggested as a major driving force for melanoma development and progression thus representing an attractive entry point for cancer gene discovery [7, 9]. Using in vivo growth aggressiveness as a grouping criterion, we provide strong evidence that aneuploidy-mediated gene expression alterations are key drivers of aggressive melanoma growth. Our observations show that 1) genes exhibiting significantly altered expression levels in fast- versus slow-growing tumors are non-randomly distributed along the chromosomes; 2) aggressiveness-associated expression differences reflect copy number alterations at the corresponding DNA loci in the vast majority of affected genes; 3) unsupervised approaches based on array CGH data indeed cluster melanoma models according to aggressiveness; 4) the pattern of DNA alterations consequently allows prediction of in vivo growth behavior; 5) genes with different DNA dose and mRNA expression levels include several well-known cancer or even melanoma genes (PTEN, NRAS, AURKA, ING3) [5, 11, 13, 14]. Altered gene expression patterns support activation of several oncogenic signaling pathways in the aggressive subgroup including fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling (upregulation of FGF1 and FGFR1, downregulation of SPRY4 and SPRED2), MAPK and PI3K signaling (upregulation of HRAS and NRAS, downregulation of PTEN), and deregulation of small G proteins with a focus on Rap1 family members (upregulation of SIPA1, downregulation of RapGEF1 and RapGEF2), mitosis effectors (AURKA, INCENP) and invasion/adhesion regulation (ITGAV, MMP9, MMP19). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study combining integrative genomics with in vivo growth aggressiveness as differentiation parameter to identify mechanisms and genes driving local melanoma growth aggressiveness. However, several other studies have used integrative genomic approaches to identify key factors driving melanoma development and/or progression. In agreement with our findings, these reports support the importance of genomic gains/losses and aneuploidy as driving forces in malignant transformation and progression [7]. Already early studies have demonstrated that the degree of aneuploidy and allelic loss might predict unfavorable prognosis [15]. Several specific chromosomal alterations (e.g. loss of chromosomes 6q and 10q, gains in chromosomes 7, 11q and 20q) were demonstrated to be associated with a more malignant phenotype and shorter patient survival [16-18]. Genome-wide array CGH approaches have been used to discriminate between nevi and melanoma [19], and specific genomic alterations were found to be associated with histological subtypes of melanoma [6], BRAF mutations [20], anatomical site as well as pattern of UV radiation exposure [19]. The melanoma models used in our study were derived from both primary and metastatic sites (including skin, lymph node, and brain) of both nodular and superficial spreading melanomas and almost generally harbored mutations in either BRAF or NRAS genes. Interestingly, unsupervised clustering of array CGH data in our melanoma set did not result in subgrouping according to histological subtype or stage of disease but rather reflected aggressiveness of in vivo growth behavior. This implies that gene dose is a major player in the deregulated expression of specific genes involved in melanoma progression. Corroborating observations were published e.g. using melanoma models from different species [21] or by comparing primary and metastatic lesions [22]. In a study by Lin et al., unsupervised clustering of 101 melanoma cell cultures based on genomic alterations led to formation of subgroups according to e.g. BRAF and NRAS status as well as losses at chromosome 10q [23]. In line with our study, multiple genes encoded in the GISTIC-positive regions were demonstrated to be deregulated at the expression level by SAM analysis. Besides the known BRAF mutations and PTEN loss also an important impact of mutations in FGFR1 and deregulation of negative MAPK feedback molecules like Spry proteins were detected [23]. Using a Bayesian network-based computational framework on the identical data set, Akavia et al. have recently identified two malignancy driver genes including one Rab GTPase protein [24]. Of note, also in our study upregulation/gain of FGFR1 (together with FGF1), loss of negative MAPK regulators including SPRY1, SPRY2 and SPRED2, and deregulation of multiple small GTPases including Rab- and Rap-regulators were associated, in addition to PTEN loss, with a more aggressive melanoma phenotype. With regard to the intracellular signaling modules indicated to be deregulated in the aggressive phenotype, several alterations like upregulated HRAS and NRAS levels suggest activation of downstream signal modules like the PI3K and the MAPK pathways. Significantly decreased PTEN expression and gene dose in our fast-growing melanomas indicate the necessity for a robust up-regulation of AKT downstream signals as driver for melanoma aggressiveness. Indeed, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is aberrantly activated in up to 70% of melanomas and has been implicated in tumor progression and chemoresistance. Accordingly, PTEN is inactivated in a high proportion of melanomas through diverse mechanisms [25, 26]. Loss of negative MAPK regulators like Spry and Spred proteins suggests concerted hyperactivation of ERK as a driver of melanoma aggressiveness. Considering the wide-spread activating mutations in BRAF this observation was somewhat surprising especially as MAPK signal attenuation by Spry2 was suggested to be lost in melanoma cells harboring BRAF V600E [27]. Additionally, we found no convincingly enhanced levels of ERK phosphorylation of the fast- as compared to the slow-growing subgroup (data not shown). This argues for a regulatory role of Spry and Spred proteins in melanoma aggressiveness independent of oncogenic BRAF-driven ERK hyperactivation. Down-regulation of Spry proteins might also enhance melanoma aggressiveness by supporting PI3K pathway activation. Thus, Edwin et al. showed that Spry2 upregulated PTEN expression and blocked EGF-mediated AKT activation and cell cycle progression [28]. Accordingly, Spry2 expression was decreased with colon cancer disease progression, and re-expression increased PTEN levels and suppressed growth and migration [29]. Similar to Spry, also Spred proteins act as inhibitors of the MAPK pathway. Spred overexpression has been shown to inhibit cancer motility, metastasis and Rho-mediated actin reorganization [30]. Mining of DNA and mRNA array data from our melanoma models suggested that changes leading to Rap1 deactivation might support the locally aggressive phenotype. For instance, expression of two Rap1 activators (RapGEF1 and RapGEF2) was significantly down-regulated in the fast-growing subgroup. Among the deactivators, the RapGAP SIPA1 was significantly overexpressed and gained at the DNA level while two further RapGAPs (Rap1GAP1 and Rap1GAP2) were upregulated up to >5-fold without reaching statistical significance. RAP1 was originally identified as a gene able to reverse the malignant features of KRAS transformed fibroblasts [31]. However, deregulation of Rap1 via Rap1GEFs and Rap1GAPs might have more complex and even opposite impacts on tumor aggressiveness (reviewed in [32]). In melanoma, previously published data implicate both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles of Rap1 and its regulators [33-38]. Rap1 activation via downregulation of RapGAP1 was suggested to support ERK activation (even in BRAF mutant melanomas) and migration of melanoma cells in vitro. [35, 37]. In contrast, Kobayashi et al. demonstrated that Rap1 upregulation might induce melanoma cell death [34]. Accordingly, a clinicopathological study reported that high Rap1GAP expression might be a useful marker to identify high-risk melanoma [33]. Additionally, ERK activation was demonstrated to be mediated by RAS rather than Rap1 in melanocytes [39]. The Rap1 regulatory gene SIPA1 (SPA-1) was most distinctly altered at the DNA and mRNA level in our melanoma subgroups but has not been connected to melanoma before. In human solid tumors, a polymorphism in the SIPA1 gene causing higher RapGAP activity was associated with high metastatic potential of breast cancer [40], and SIPA1 expression was found to positively correlate with disease progression and metastasis in human prostate cancer [41]. Therefore, we decided to knock-down this protein in melanoma models with fast- and slow-growing signature. Interestingly, this led to enhanced cell adhesion but reduced clonogenic potential and migration exclusively in the fast-growing melanoma model, suggesting a complex role of the SIPA1/Rap1 axis in regulating melanoma growth and invasion. Taken together our study demonstrates that aneuploidy-driven deregulation of gene expression is one major driver defining the degree of local aggressiveness in human melanoma xenograft models. Thus non-random genomic alterations represent - besides activating gene mutations - an additional mechanism promoting concerted hyperactivation of major growth and survival pathways essential for human melanoma aggressiveness in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Primary cell cultures. Primary melanoma cell cultures were established at the Institute of Cancer Research, Medical University Vienna and the Wagner Jauregg Hospital, Linz, and authenticated as previously described [10, 13, 42] and cultured in growth medium containing 10% FCS and 1% glutamine without antibiotics. Histological classification, origin, BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61 mutation status of 32 melanoma cell cultures are given in Supplementary Table S1. Melanoma xenograft models. Subcutaneous tumor growth was initiated by injection of primary melanoma cells into 6-8 weeks old immunocompromised female mice (2.5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells into nu/nu mice; Iffa Credo, Charles Rivers, Arbresle, France for the initial 11 melanoma models; or 1 ' 10 6 cells for all melanoma models into SCID/BALBc; Harlan Winkelman, Borchen, Germany). Each experimental group contained 5 mice. Body weight and tumor size using a vernier caliper [43] were determined three times per week. All in vivo experiments described in the present study were performed on the basis of Authorization (LA1230509) of the Animal Ethics Committee of the Federal Department of Health, Nutritional Safety and Environment (Belgium) or according to the Austrian and FELASA guidelines for animal care and protection. Histology and immunohistochemistry. Tumor, lung, liver, kidney, and brain were removed, fixed in buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin for conventional histopathological HE staining. Three H&E-stained slides per organ were analyzed to look for metastases. Additional 5 slides through the whole piece were analyzed when the first screening was negative. For staining of tumor sections for SIPA1, the SPA-1 antibody (B-7, Santa Cruz) was applied using a 1:150 dilution. Array genomic comparative hybridization (array CGH). Tumor-DNA was isolated using the DNA Blood Mini Kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Normal human reference DNA from multiple anonymous male donors was purchased from Promega (G147A, Madison, WI). Array CGH analyses using 4x44K oligonucleotide-based microarrays (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) were performed according to the manufacturer`s protocol and as described previously [44]. Scanning was performed on a G2505B Micro Array Scanner (Agilent). Feature extraction and data analysis were carried out using the Feature Extraction (version 10.7.3.1) and DNA Analytics software (version 4.0.81), respectively. Array CGH raw 2-channel (red/green) log2-ratios were calculated and exported to Excel spreadsheets. Log2-ratios were used (i) as starting point for GISTIC analysis, (ii) as input for un-supervised clustering of chromosomal regions (WECCA), and (iii) for the supervised cluster analysis and graphical representation of significant loci based on un-segmented probe-level data. (i) GISTIC analysis [45] was performed using the GenePattern analysis platform at the public server of the Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern). Segmentation was done employing the CBS algorithm (GenePattern). SGOL scores (Segment Gain Or Loss) were calculated using a modified version of the GISTIC algorithm by the \u00a1\u00b0SGOLscore\u00a1\u00b1 function in the \u00a1\u00b0cghMCR\u00a1\u00b1 package for Bioconductor 2.5 using R version 2.12.0 [46]. (ii) Unsupervised clustering segmentation and copy number aberrations were calculated by the \u00a1\u00b0CGHcall\u00a1\u00b1 algorithm employing the \u00a1\u00b0CGHraw\u00a1\u00b1 and \u00a1\u00b0CGHcall\u00a1\u00b1 packages for Bioconductor [47]. The algorithm implemented in the \u00a1\u00b0CGHregions\u00a1\u00b1 package was used for dimensionality reduction of the region data [47] prior to clustering by the WECCA (Weighted Clustering of Called Array CGH data) method [48]. Cluster representations and dendrograms were generated using the authors\u00a1\u00af scripts for R (set to average linkage for agreement). (iii) Graphical representations of supervised clustering of un-segmented probe data were done with Genesis or Genespring. Chromosomal aberration scores were calculated using the Agilent software (ADM-2 algorithm) and plotted in R along the chromosomal positions for the comparisons with mean gene expression changes. Whole genome gene expression arrays. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol/Chloroform. Quantity and integrity of the RNA samples was checked on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (RIN values were >9 in all samples). Gene expression arrays were performed using 4x44K whole genome oligonucleotide-based gene expression microarrays (Agilent). Labeling and hybridization procedures were performed according to the instructions provided by Agilent using the Quick Amp Labeling Kit and the One Colour Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis Protocol. Shortly, in a first step 500 ng of total RNA were converted into cDNA using a T7 promoter primer. In a second labeling and amplification step, cDNA was converted into cRNA and labeled with Cy3-CTP. After purification of labeled cRNAs with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), 1650 ng per sample were heat fragmentated for 30 min at 60\u00a1\u00c6C. Hybridization was carried out for 17 h at 65\u00a1\u00c6C in a hybridization oven. Afterwards, slides were washed and scanned on a G2505B Micro Array Scanner (Agilent). Feature extraction and data analysis were carried out using the Feature Extraction and Gene Spring software, respectively. Array raw data were also exported to Excel spreadsheets, normalized to the 75 th percentile, and used for clustering in the Genesis 1.7.5 software [49]. In cases of redundancy, data have been consolidated by using the probe set with the highest hybridization efficiency. Mean gene expression values (log2-ratios between the fast and slow growing groups) were plotted along the chromosomal positions (hg18 coordinates from Agilent) in R. Real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was performed as described [43]. Reactions contained 20 ng cDNA and 20 \u00a5\u00ecl SYBR-Green-Power Mastermix (AppliedBiosystems, California, US) and 0.2 \u00a5\u00ecl per primer. Reactions were set-up in triplicates using the following primers (100 nM): SIPA1, fw 5`-AAG GTG GGC ATC CTG TAC TG-3`, rev 5`-TCT CGT GGT CCT GGT ATG TG-3`; NUS1, fw 5`-CCA GTT AGT AGC CCA GAA GC-3`, rev 5`-GAT GTG CCA GGG AAG AAA GC-3`; DNAJC1, fw 5`-CTC AGC CAA CTG ACA AGA AG-3`, rev 5`-TGA GTT CGG AGA GTC TAA CC-3`; \u00a5\u00e2-actin, fw 5`-GGA GGC AGA AGG AGA TCA CTG-3`, rev 5`-CGA TCC ACA CGG AGT ACT TG-3`; and GAPDH, fw 5`-CTG GCG TCT TCA CCA CCA T-3`, rev 5`-GCC TGC TTC ACC ACC TTC T-3`. PCR was performed on a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System and results analysed in 7500 Fast System Detection Software (SDS) v1.4 (Applied Biosystems). For the thermal profile of the amplification run, following cycling conditions were chosen: 50\u00a1\u00c6C (2 min), followed by 40 cycles with 95\u00a1\u00c6C (15 s), 60\u00a1\u00c6C (1 min). Western blot. Western blot was performed as described previously [13]. The following antibodies were used: SPA-1 (B-7) and RAP1 (both Santa Cruz, CA); \u00a5\u00e2-actin (Sigma, St Louis, MO). Suppression of SIPA1 expression by siRNA. 5\u00a1\u00bf10 5 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were treated with 25 nM SIPA1 siRNA and control scrambled siRNA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (DharmaFECT; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). After 24 h of incubation with siRNA, cells were counted, and the respective number of cells was seeded and incubated in fresh medium according to the respective procedures. Cell adhesion, migration and clonogenic potential. Cell migration and clonogenic capacity of melanoma cells were determined as described in [43] and [50], respectively. For assessment of cell adhesion, cells were treated with siRNA as described above, and 4x10 3 cells were seeded into 96well plates for 3 h and 24 h. After this time, cells were washed and the medium was removed. After incubation of the remaining adhered cells for 24 h, cell viability was assessed by MTT assay as published [13].

Nevertheless, resistance develops through several mechanisms, including activation of AKT signaling. Though much is known about the specific molecular lesions conferring resistance to anti-EGFR?based therapies, additional molecular characterization of the downstream mediators of EGFR signaling may lead to the development of new classes of targeted molecular therapies to treat resistant disease. We identified a transcriptional network involving the tumor suppressors Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) that negatively regulates activated EGFR signaling in both cell culture and in vivo models. Furthermore, the use of the FDA-approved drug trifluoperazine hydrochloride (TFP), which has been shown to inhibit FOXO1 nuclear export, restored sensitivity to AKT-driven erlotinib resistance through modulation of the KLF6/FOXO1 signaling cascade in both cell culture and xenograft models of lung adenocarcinoma. Combined, these findings define a novel transcriptional network regulating oncogenic EGFR signaling and identify a class of FDA-approved drugs as capable of restoring chemosensitivity to anti-EGFR?based therapy for the treatment of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Introduction. The complete molecular and functional characterization of key oncogenic signaling pathways in human cancer has allowed for a greater understanding of mechanisms involved in signal transduction and has laid the framework for the development of targeted molecular therapies designed to the specific alterations driving cancer development and progression. Numerous studies have indicated a causal role for EGFR signaling in the development and progression of lung cancer (1, 2). In addition, targeted molecular therapies directed against EGFR signaling have become a mainstay for the treatment of metastatic lung adenocarcinomas (3) that exhibit increased EGFR expression, receptor amplification, and activating mutations. The molecular characterization of key downstream activators of EGFR signaling has allowed for a better understanding and prediction of potential mechanisms of resistance to these newer targeted molecular agents. Indeed, the clinical utility of anti-EGFR?based strategies is ultimately limited by primary or acquired drug resistance (1, 2). Primary and acquired resistance to anti-EGFR?based therapies can develop through several distinct molecular mechanisms, including a gatekeeper mutation of the T790 residue (T790M) in EGFR (1, 2), activating mutations downstream of EGFR (K-Ras, ref. 4; or PI3K, ref. 5), MET amplification (6) or loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (7). Recent evidence suggests that additional mechanisms including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and histological conversion from an adenocarcinoma to small cell cancer?like phenotype may also contribute TKI resistance (8). Less is known, however, about the negative downstream effectors of oncogenic EGFR signaling. Thus, a more complete molecular characterization and mechanistic understanding of downstream transcriptional regulators of oncogenic EGFR signaling will provide a greater understanding of the downstream mediators of treatment resistance and provide the experimental basis for the development of a new class of rationally designed drugs. Two transcription factors of interest, forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), have been shown to play central roles in the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. KLF6 is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated by loss of heterozygosity (LOH), dysregulated alternative splicing, somatic mutation, and decreased expression in human cancer (9). In the field of lung cancer, several microarray studies have identified KLF6 (usually referred to in these reports as COPEB) as significantly dysregulated in tumors relative to normal tissue and/or as a contributor to gene signatures that predict patient survival (10?12). In addition, KLF6 expression was found to be significantly decreased in patient-derived lung adenocarcinoma samples compared with matched normal lung tissue in several recent studies by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (13). Consistent with its function as a tumor suppressor gene, overexpression of KLF6 resulted in spontaneous apoptosis and decreased colony formation in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (11, 13). In addition, KLF6 expression has been identified to be highly correlated with EGFR signaling and a target of PI3K-mediated signaling (14, 15). FOXO1 is a transcriptional regulator of the G 1/S checkpoint and of apoptosis (16). It has been identified as being functionally inactivated in cancer by AKT-mediated phosphorylation in a variety of human malignancies and is a direct transcriptional activator of KLF6 gene expression through binding to the KLF6 promoter (14, 17). Combined, these data led us to explore and further define the potential role of the FOXO1/KLF6 transcriptional network in the regulation of EGFR signaling in lung adenocarcinoma. Results. Activated EGFR correlates with downregulation of KLF6 expression in lung adenocarcinoma.. Various reports have demonstrated frequent downregulation of the tumor suppressor KLF6 in primary human lung cancers (10, 11, 13, 18). To further confirm and extend these findings, we used a cohort of microdissected normal and tumor patient-derived lung adenocarcinoma samples (Mount Sinai Tumor Biorepository) and performed qRT-PCR using validated real-time PCR primers specific to KLF6 (19) and Western blotting with a KLF6 polyclonal antibody to quantitate KLF6 expression in 12 matched tumor/normal tissue pairs. KLF6 mRNA and protein expression were decreased in all patient tumor samples analyzed by an average of more than 50% compared with surrounding normal lung tissue (Figure ?(Figure1,1, A and B). Based on a recent study that reported a correlation between EGFR signaling and KLF6 expression (15, 20), and given that activated EGFR signaling is a critical mediator of lung cancer development (21), we sought to investigate the relationship between activated EGFR signaling and KLF6 expression. These matched tumor/normal tissue pairs were analyzed for the presence of genetic alterations in the EGFR signaling pathway using the qBiomarker somatic mutation PCR array (QIAGEN). This array profiles the somatic mutation status for EGFR and a number of downstream signaling mediators, including KRAS, PIK3CA, AKT1, and PTEN. Activating EGFR and PIK3CA mutations were associated with increased AKT signaling as demonstrated by an increase in the p-AKT to AKT ratio. Patient tumor samples with activated AKT, through either PIK3CA or EGFR mutations, expressed low levels of KLF6 (Table ?(Table1).1). Given this association, we sought to specifically determine whether EGFR activation regulates KLF6 expression using a murine model of EGFR-activated lung adenocarcinoma (22). This murine model is driven by the EGFR L858R allele, a commonly mutated residue in human lung cancers that is characterized by constitutive downstream signaling (22). In a tetracycline-inducible system for conditional EGFR overexpression, these animals develop highly penetrant (~100%) and aggressive lung adenocarcinoma within 4?8 weeks on a doxycycline-supplemented diet (22). We used qRT-PCR and Western blotting with a mutation-specific EGFR L858R monoclonal antibody (23) to confirm increased expression of EGFR in the mouse-derived tumors as compared with normal lung tissue obtained from WT age- and sex-matched littermates on a doxycycline-supplemented diet (Figure ?(Figure1,1, C and D). Consistent with our observations in human lung adenocarcinoma patient samples, EGFR activation in this murine model of the disease was associated with a greater than 50% decrease in expression of KLF6 mRNA and protein (Figure ?(Figure1,1, D and E). These data further strengthened the association between EGFR activation and transcriptional downregulation of the KLF6 tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma and prompted further investigation delineation of the mechanism of KLF6 regulation by activated EGFR signaling. KLF6 is transcriptionally upregulated by inhibition of EGFR signaling by anti-EGFR therapeutics.. Given our data supporting the hypothesis that EGFR activation results in KLF6 downregulation, we sought to inhibit this pathway and assess effects on KLF6 expression. The EGFR L858R murine model demonstrates spontaneous tumor regression (22) when treated with erlotinib, an FDA-approved small molecule inhibitor of EGFR signaling. We analyzed L858R mouse tumor samples obtained from mice treated with erlotinib and found increased expression of KLF6 mRNA and protein following EGFR inhibition (Figure ?(Figure1,1, F and G, and Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; doi: 10.1172/JCI62058DS1). In vivo upregulation of KLF6 in these tumors correlated with increased levels of apoptosis as demonstrated by Western blotting for caspase-3 cleavage (Figure ?(Figure11G). To further validate and extend these findings to relevant cell culture models of lung cancer, we used a panel of human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines to determine the effects of EGFR inhibition on KLF6 gene transcription. We examined 4 human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines: 2 harboring EGFR activating mutations in which EGFR signaling can be effectively inhibited by TKI addition and 2 cell lines in which EGFR signaling cannot be inhibited secondary to activation of the AKT or Ras signaling pathways (Table ?(Table22). Consistent with the effect seen in the EGFR-driven L858R model in vivo, the HCC827 and H3255 cell lines, which harbor activating EGFR mutations (7) (specifically a deletion in exon 19 and L858R, respectively), showed significant increases in KLF6 mRNA and protein expression and induction of spontaneous apoptosis upon inhibition of EGFR signaling with erlotinib addition (Figure ?(Figure2,2, A?C, and Supplemental Figure 2, A and B). We additionally measured KLF6 promoter activation in the treatment sensitive HCC827 cell line using a hybrid 2.2-kb KLF6 promoter?luciferase construct (24). Treatment of HCC827 with erlotinib induced a 5-fold increase in KLF6 promoter activity (Supplemental Figure 3), indicating that EGFR inhibition induces KLF6 gene transcription. In contrast, the H1650 and A549 cell lines, which are erlotinib resistant secondary to constitutive activation of downstream signaling mediators of EGFR signaling (4), did not demonstrate KLF6 upregulation upon erlotinib addition (Figure ?(Figure2,2, A?C, and Supplemental Figure 2, C and D). Treatment of A549 cells with an increased dose (1 \u00a5\u00ecM) of erlotinib to sufficiently inhibit the EGFR signaling pathway resulted in inhibition of AKT signaling and a subsequent increase in KLF6 expression (Supplemental Figure 4, A and B). Combined, these data demonstrate that KLF6 is negatively regulated by activated EGFR signaling both in cell culture and in vivo, and that upregulation of KLF6 occurs upon inhibition of EGFR signaling, suggesting that one or both of the critical downstream pathways regulating EGFR signaling is involved in the regulation of KLF6 expression. EGFR-driven AKT activation regulates KLF6 transcription.. EGFR activates two major downstream pathways, the Ras/Raf/MAPK and the PI3K/AKT signaling cascades (25). As the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway is a critical regulator of proliferation downstream of EGFR (4), we sought to determine whether Ras signaling affected KLF6 expression in an in vivo model. The Kras LA2 murine model of K-Ras activation (26) carries oncogenic alleles of K-Ras that become activated after a spontaneous recombination event in a \u00a1\u00b0hit-and-run\u00a1\u00b1 transgenic design. The activation of K-Ras, which occurs at a higher rate in lung epithelial tissue, leads to development of lung tumors that are phenotypically and histologically similar to human non?small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To ensure that changes in KLF6 expression were not a secondary result of tumor formation, we microdissected nodules out of each sample and utilized the noncancerous adjacent tissue for the analysis of K-Ras activation in comparison to age-matched/sex-matched WT littermates. Western blotting using ERK- and p-ERK?specific antibodies confirmed activated K-Ras signaling in the K-Ras LA2 mouse lung tissue compared with WT littermates (Figure ?(Figure3,3, A and B). KLF6 expression was then analyzed using qRT-PCR and Western blotting; however, no significant changes were found in either KLF6 mRNA or protein expression in the context of activation of K-Ras (Figure ?(Figure3,3, A and C). These data suggested that the Ras/Raf/MAPK component of the EGFR signaling pathway was most likely not responsible for the KLF6 downregulation observed in the context of activated EGFR signaling. To further confirm these negative results, we used the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 to inhibit downstream signaling of Ras in cell culture. AZD6244 is an uncompetitive allosteric ATP inhibitor of MEK that is currently in phase II clinical trials for a number of cancers, including NSCLC (27, 28). Treatment of the EGFR-activated HCC827 cells with AZD6244 resulted in a decrease in phosphorylated ERK as shown by Western blotting (Figure ?(Figure3D),3D), thereby confirming effective inhibition of the Ras signaling pathway. KLF6 expression was unchanged between treated and untreated cells at both the mRNA and protein levels, and there was no significant induction of apoptosis (Figure ?(Figure3,3, D and E, and data not shown). These data further demonstrated that the Ras signaling cascade was not responsible for regulating KLF6 expression. Based upon these findings, we focused on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, the other critical downstream mediator of activated EGFR signaling. We utilized the Pten/Mmac1 +/? heterozygous mouse model (29), which is characterized by constitutively activated AKT signaling due to Pten haploinsufficiency. Analysis by Western blotting confirmed decreased PTEN expression and increased phosphorylation of AKT in lung tissue from heterozygous Pten +/? mice compared with age- and sex-matched WT littermates (Figure ?(Figure4,4, A and B). This activated AKT signaling was associated with decreased Klf6 mRNA and protein expression as assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting in heterozygous Pten +/? mice compared with age-/sex-matched WT littermates (Figure ?(Figure4,4, A and C). To further extend and validate these findings, we utilized MK-2206, which is a highly selective non-ATP-competitive allosteric AKT inhibitor (30), to further elucidate the relationship between activated AKT signaling and downregulation of KLF6 expression. Western blotting showed a decrease in AKT activation as assessed by phosphorylation of serine 473 (31) in the HCC827 cell line when treated with MK-2206 (Figure ?(Figure4D).4D). Effective inhibition of AKT signaling resulted in an upregulation of KLF6 protein and mRNA (Figure ?(Figure4,4, D and E). Inhibition of AKT resulted in no significant increase in apoptosis (data not shown) suggesting that AKT inhibition alone is not sufficient to induce apoptosis, consistent with several recent studies (30, 32) that have demonstrated that inhibition of both arms of the EGFR signaling pathway (RAS and AKT) is required for the induction of apoptosis. We next overexpressed a constitutively active form of AKT in the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line (33) and measured KLF6 promoter activation and mRNA and protein levels. This cell line is highly transfectable and expresses lower levels of activated AKT signaling at baseline (data not shown), making it an ideal model system to study the effects of AKT overexpression on KLF6 expression. Increased AKT signaling resulted in a marked reduction in KLF6 promoter activation and endogenous KLF6 mRNA and protein expression (Figure ?(Figure4,4, F?H), further confirming that KLF6 expression is negatively regulated by EGFR-driven activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in human lung adenocarcinoma. To extend these findings to human lung cancer, we analyzed an additional cohort of patient-derived lung adenocarcinoma samples to determine whether activated AKT signaling negatively regulates KLF6 gene transcription in human disease. We determined the mutation status of the 26 patient-derived lung adenocarcinoma samples using the previously described somatic mutation PCR array and characterized samples either as AKT activated (harboring EGFR, PI3K, or PTEN mutation), K-Ras driven, or harboring neither K-Ras nor AKT pathway aberrations (WT tumors). We found that only in the AKT-activated tumors was there a negative correlation between KLF6 expression and p-AKT (Supplemental Figure 5). These data further demonstrate that KLF6 expression is negatively regulated by the AKT signaling pathway in human lung adenocarcinoma. FOXO1 is a transcriptional regulator of KLF6 in lung adenocarcinoma.. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway mediates tumor progression via downstream regulation of BCL-2 family proteins, NF-\u00a5\u00eaB, and FOXO transcription factors. The FOXO transcription factors have been identified as putative tumor suppressor genes and have been shown to induce apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines (34?36). AKT-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO factors results in CRM-1?dependent nuclear export, proteasomal degradation, and diminished transcriptional activity (17, 37). Recently, transcriptome analysis of liver ECs in a FOXO-deficient Mx-Cre + mouse identified KLF6 as one of the top two most significantly downregulated genes with the highest number of conserved FOXO-binding elements (36). Moreover, a ChIP-based study identified KLF6 as a direct transcriptional target of FOXO1 (14). Based on these reports and given the evidence presented here that KLF6 is transcriptionally regulated by activated AKT signaling, we hypothesized that AKT-mediated inactivation of FOXO1 is a critical negative regulator of KLF6 expression. In order to test this hypothesis, we overexpressed FOXO1 to examine a direct relationship between AKT, FOXO1, and KLF6. Again, due to its high transfection efficiency and low levels of baseline AKT activation, the A549 cell line was used for these studies. Overexpression of FOXO1 in A549 cells resulted in increased KLF6 promoter activation as well as mRNA and protein expression (Figure ?(Figure5,5, A?D). Additionally in the Pten-heterozygous mice, which demonstrated activated AKT signaling in the lung, the level of phosphorylated FOXO1 at the AKT phosphorylation site serine 256 (38) was increased, and this correlated with decreased KLF6 expression (Figure ?(Figure4,4, A?C). Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that inhibition of EGFR-driven AKT activation could prevent FOXO1 phosphorylation and result in reactivation of this transcriptional network. Consistent with this hypothesis, addition of erlotinib to the treatment-sensitive HCC827 cell line decreased FOXO1 phosphorylation at serine 256 and led to FOXO1 accumulation in the nucleus. The increase in nuclear FOXO1 resulted in increased transcriptional activation of KLF6 and subsequent induction of apoptosis (Figure ?(Figure5,5, E and F, and Supplemental Figure 1). Furthermore, analysis of the patient-derived tumor samples analyzed previously (Figure ?(Figure1,1, A and B) displayed a positive correlation between FOXO1 and KLF6 expression, extending our cell culture and in vivo findings to patient-derived lung adenocarcinoma samples (Supplemental Figure 6). Based upon these findings, we hypothesized that the FOXO1-driven upregulation of KLF6 was required for erlotinib-mediated apoptosis in EGFR-driven lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Silencing of FOXO1 using RNAi blunted erlotinib-induced KLF6 upregulation and prevented apoptosis as indicated by Western blotting for cleaved caspase-3 (Figure ?(Figure5,5, G?I). Collectively, these data identify a novel transcriptional network that negatively regulates oncogenic EGFR signaling and modulates the apoptotic response to anti-EGFR?based therapies in EGFR-driven cell lines and murine models of lung cancer. Upregulation of the KLF6 tumor suppressor is required for erlotinib response both in cell culture and in vivo.. Based on the findings that inhibition of activated EGFR signaling results in increased KLF6 expression, we next sought to determine the role of increased KLF6 expression in the regulation of apoptosis. To determine the dynamics of KLF6 upregulation in response to erlotinib, we conducted a time course experiment in the EGFR-activated and erlotinib-sensitive cell line HCC827. qRT-PCR of KLF6 mRNA and Western blot analysis for protein expression at 4 time points demonstrated that KLF6 expression was significantly upregulated at 12 and 24 hours after addition of erlotinib (Figure ?(Figure6,6, A and B). These findings correlated with the apoptotic response in cells, which was determined using cell cycle analysis via flow cytometry (Figure ?(Figure6C).6C). These results suggested that the kinetics of KLF6 upregulation in response to EGFR inhibition were consistent with a potential role for this gene in the induction of apoptosis. Given the marked upregulation of KLF6 expression upon inhibition of EGFR signaling in the HCC827 cell line, we used sequence-specific siRNAs to KLF6 to blunt its upregulation and determine the potential biological effect of KLF6 upregulation on cellular apoptosis. Transfection of sequence-specific siRNAs to KLF6 (39) in HCC827 cells resulted in a greater than 50% downregulation of KLF6 expression at baseline and a greater than 80% downregulation of KLF6 mRNA and protein in the presence of erlotinib relative to a scrambled siRNA control (Supplemental Figure 7, A and B). Targeted reduction of KLF6 blunted the levels of erlotinib-driven apoptosis in the EGFR-activated cell line HCC827. This result was confirmed by cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry (Supplemental Figure 7C), Annexin V staining, and additional markers of apoptosis, including cleaved PARP and caspase-3 expression by Western blotting (Supplemental Figure 7C, Supplemental Figure 8, A and B, and data not shown). To confirm these findings, we used an additional treatment-sensitive cell line, H3255, in which transfection of sequence-specific KLF6 siRNAs resulted in downregulation of KLF6 expression at both the mRNA and protein level and subsequent inhibition of erlotinib-mediated apoptosis (Supplemental Figure 9, A?C). Combined, these data suggest that KLF6 upregulation is necessary for the induction of apoptosis by anti-EGFR?based therapy in metastatic lung cancer cell lines. To further extend these findings and determine whether the upregulation of KLF6 was necessary for anti-EGFR?based therapy response in vivo, we used shRNA interference to stably knock down KLF6. Stable knockdown of KLF6 expression (Figure ?(Figure6,6, D and E) in the HCC827 cell line decreased erlotinib-driven apoptosis, as demonstrated by decreased PARP cleavage and a decreased sub-G 1 fraction in cell cycle analysis (Figure ?(Figure6,6, E and F). This result was further validated using a clonogenic assay in which addition of erlotinib resulted in decreased colony formation in the control shLuc line but not in shKLF6 cells (Figure ?(Figure6G).6G). Additional characterization of the colony size and number revealed that shLuc-treated cells decreased in both colony number and size, whereas shKLF6-treated cells decreased in size but not colony number (Supplemental Figure 10, A?C). This suggested that erlotinib was still causing growth arrest through suppression of ERK signaling in the shKLF6-treated cells. Characterization of the stable cell lines for downstream targets of EGFR pathway inhibition demonstrated that erlotinib still inhibited AKT and Ras signaling, suggesting that KLF6 inhibition did not affect drug binding or upstream pathway inhibition in response to anti-EGFR?based therapy, but did affect erlotinib-driven apoptosis through decreased activation of the FOXO1/KLF6 transcriptional network (Figure ?(Figure66E). Based upon these data, we decided to further explore the dependence of anti-EGFR?based therapy response on KLF6 upregulation in an in vivo model of lung cancer by injecting the shLuc and shKLF6 stable cell lines subcutaneously into nude mice (n = 18). After the tumors reached an average volume of 150 mm 3, we divided them into 4 treatment groups: shLuc treated with vehicle control (DMSO) (n = 4), shLuc treated with erlotinib (n = 5), shKLF6 treated with vehicle control (n = 4), and shKLF6 treated with erlotinib (n = 5). We measured tumor growth in the nude mice 48 hours after each drug injection. Immunohistochemical studies showed that shKLF6-derived tumors maintained a decrease in KLF6 expression compared with shLuc-derived tumors (Supplemental Figure 11). While erlotinib treatment did not significantly decrease the tumor volume in the shKLF6-derived tumors, the shLuc-derived tumors responded to the anti-EGFR therapy, showing significantly smaller tumor volumes than in the DMSO-treated control group at the conclusion of the study (Figure ?(Figure6,6, H?J). Combined, these data confirm that transcriptional activation of the KLF6 tumor suppressor gene is necessary for an anti-EGFR?based therapy response in both cell culture and mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma. Based upon these findings, we therefore hypothesized that acquired resistance to anti-EGFR?based therapies could be overcome by restoring downstream function of the FOXO1/KLF6 transcriptional network in erlotinib-resistant lung cancer driven by activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Inhibition of FOXO1 nuclear export increases KLF6 expression.. Inactivation of the FOXO1 transcription factor in cancer predominantly occurs through alterations in its subcellular localization (Supplemental Figure 12 and ref. 40). We therefore sought a pharmacologically and clinically viable approach to activate FOXO1 by retaining nuclear localization and overcoming the mislocalization seen in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and patient samples (35). Trifluoperazine hydrochloride (TFP), an FDA-approved antipsychotic and antiemetic, was identified in a chemical genetic screen to be an effective nuclear export inhibitor of the FOXO1 transcription factor (41). Although TFP has traditionally been utilized as a dopamine receptor antagonist, it has also been shown to increase FOXO1 nuclear localization via calmodulin inhibition upstream of AKT and downstream of PI3K (41). We thus chose to inhibit nuclear export of FOXO1 using TFP to determine whether activation of the FOXO1/KLF6 transcriptional network could restore sensitivity to the erlotinib-resistant cell line H1650, in which resistance is driven by activated PI3K/AKT signaling (Supplemental Figure 13) due to PTEN depletion (42). We chose TFP for several reasons: (a) it is already FDA approved and has been used in patients for more than 20 years with a well-defined toxicity and safety profile; (b) if TFP were effective in modulating treatment response in erlotinib-resistant lung cancer, the path to clinical translation would be most evident and accessible given that both drugs are FDA approved; and (c) at the molecular level, TFP potentially regulates the FOXO/KLF6 transcriptional network, which might allow for fewer potential mechanisms for the development of resistance to this drug combination. To examine the effect of TFP on nuclear localization of FOXO1 and subsequent KLF6 transactivation, we treated H1650 cells with increasing doses of TFP. Subcellular fractionation confirmed that addition of TFP did in fact increase nuclear FOXO1 expression (Figure ?(Figure7A7A and Supplemental Figure 14). Nuclear accumulation of FOXO1 resulted in concurrent upregulation of KLF6 mRNA and protein after treatment with 20 \u00a5\u00ecM TFP (Figure ?(Figure7,7, A and B). There was, however, no significant increase in apoptosis (data not shown). This suggests that restoration of FOXO1/KLF6 transcriptional network was not sufficient to induce apoptosis; however, the combination of TFP with anti-EGFR?based therapy may result in treatment response. Combination of TFP with erlotinib increases apoptosis and decreases tumorigenicity.. Given that TFP has the potential to relocalize FOXO1, we sought to explore the therapeutic potential of combining TFP with erlotinib in both cell culture and in vivo models of lung adenocarcinoma. Isobologram analysis revealed that the combination of erlotinib and TFP had a marked synergistic effect on cell death (Figure ?(Figure7C7C and Supplemental Figure 15) in a PI3K/AKT-driven model of treatment resistance due to PTEN depletion (42). To extend these findings to an in vivo model of the disease, we injected the erlotinib-resistant cell line H1650 subcutaneously into nude mice (n = 54). We measured tumor growth weekly until average tumor volume for all mice was approximately 200 mm 3, at which point the mice received vehicle control (DMSO) (n = 13), erlotinib (n = 14), TFP (n = 14), or erlotinib in combination with TFP (n = 13). Tumor growth in H1650-injected nude mice was measured 48 hours after each drug injection. Although the tumor volume increased with vehicle control and erlotinib (Figure ?(Figure8A),8A), it decreased after treatment with TFP alone. Furthermore, combination of TFP and erlotinib led to the greatest regression in tumor volume (Figure ?(Figure8A).8A). Similar results were seen after the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were collected for determination of mass (data not shown). Consistent with our cell culture data, analysis of TFP/erlotinib-treated tumors showed an increase in FOXO1 nuclear localization (Supplemental Figure 16) and an increase in expression of KLF6 mRNA and protein compared with both control mice and those treated with erlotinib alone (Figure ?(Figure8,8, B and C, and Supplemental Figure 17). We next sought to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the modulation of erlotinib and TFP response in vivo. Analysis of the tumor xenografts treated with TFP and the TFP/erlotinib combination demonstrated an increase in apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL (Figure ?(Figure8,8, D and E). Evaluation of the proliferative index of each of the treated tumors for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression showed a decrease in cell number with treatment with either erlotinib alone or erlotinib in combination with TFP (Figure ?(Figure8,8, F and G). Combined, these data highlight the importance of the Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway, which was inhibited effectively by erlotinib, in the regulation of cellular proliferation; and of the AKT/PI3K signaling axis, which was inhibited effectively by TFP, in the regulation of cellular survival and proliferation in vivo. The rational combination of drugs that inhibit both of these signaling pathways in vivo through modulation of downstream signaling networks can result in marked tumor regression in otherwise treatment-resistant lung adenocarcinoma. In order to determine the specificity of this drug combination in inducing apoptosis through modulation of the FOXO1/KLF6 transcriptional network, we used shRNA interference to stably knock down FOXO1 (Figure ?(Figure9,9, A and B). Inhibition of FOXO1 resulted in decreased apoptosis in the combination erlotinib- and TFP-treated cells as demonstrated by a decreased sub-G 1 fraction in cell cycle analysis and decreased PARP cleavage (Figure ?(Figure9,9, C and D, and Supplemental Figure 18, A and B). The upregulation of downstream targets of FOXO1, such as KLF6, was blunted with the addition of erlotinib and TFP in shFOXO1-treated cells (Figure ?(Figure9E9E and Supplemental Figure 18, A and B). These data suggest that the modulation of FOXO1 and KLF6 is in some part necessary for the apoptosis induced by the rational combination of drugs that inhibit the major EGFR downstream signaling pathways. Furthermore, given that TFP increases nuclear FOXO1 through calmodulin inhibition upstream of AKT, we sought to explore whether inhibition of AKT signaling via an AKT inhibitor, MK-2206, would similarly increase FOXO1 nuclear localization. Treatment with MK-2206 resulted in increased nuclear FOXO1 expression and a subsequent increase in KLF6 mRNA and protein expression in H1650 as well as in a non-EGFR-activated cell line, A549 (Figure ?(Figure10,10, A?C, and Supplemental Figure 19, A?C). The combination of MK-2206 and erlotinib resulted in inhibition of downstream AKT and Ras signaling and an increase in apoptosis (Figure ?(Figure10,10, D and E). This increase in apoptosis was blunted with the inhibition of FOXO1 as seen through decreased PARP cleavage and sub-G 1 fraction in cell cycle analysis (Figure ?(Figure9D,9D, Figure ?Figure10F,10F, and data not shown). These data further strengthen and confirm the hypothesis that modulation of the FOXO1/KLF6 transcriptional network is required for EGFR pathway inhibition?driven apoptosis. In conclusion, these data highlight a key role for the FOXO1 and KLF6 tumor suppressor genes as downstream negative regulators of EGFR-driven cell survival. Modulation of this transcriptional network with two FDA-approved drugs can in fact restore sensitivity to cell lines resistant to anti-EGFR therapy in vitro and in vivo (Figure ?(Figure11).11). Therefore, our studies identify a novel combination of FDA-approved drugs that are effective in vivo for the treatment of AKT-driven anti-EGFR?resistant lung adenocarcinoma. Given the high rate of resistance that inevitably develops to all anti-EGFR?based therapy, and that resistance driven through activated AKT signaling is responsible for more than 20% of all TKI-resistant disease, we believe these findings have immediate clinical relevance for a substantial percentage of patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Discussion. The American Cancer Society estimates that there were 157,300 deaths from lung cancer in the United States for 2010 (43). Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common histology (~50%) among NSCLCs, which as a group constitute the majority of all lung malignancies (~80%). Dysregulated EGFR signaling has been implicated as having a central role in the pathogenesis of a significant percentage of lung adenocarcinomas. Accordingly, much effort has been focused on the development of anti-EGFR?based therapies for the treatment of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Erlotinib has been found to be efficacious in patients with activating EGFR mutations such as the exon 19 deletion and L858R. Additionally, recent studies have suggested that EGFR mutation?positive patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma receiving first-line treatment with erlotinib had significantly longer progression-free survival and fewer side effects compared with patients treated with traditional cyctotoxic chemotherapy. This illustrates the paradigm that the use of genetics- and genomics-based approaches to stratify patients to appropriate first-line targeted therapies can have direct clinical application and impact. Despite these advances, treatment resistance invariably develops to these targeted molecular agents through a variety of different mechanisms and pathways. Commonly, constitutive activation of downstream mediators of a specific oncogenic signaling pathway will result in the development of treatment resistance. This suggests that the identification and targeting of the most downstream/terminal regulators of signaling may ultimately prove to be the most therapeutically viable approaches for cancer treatment. In this article, we identify a nuclear transcriptional network involving the KLF6 and FOXO1 tumor suppressor genes that negatively regulate activated oncogenic EGFR signaling and response to anti-EGFR?based therapies in both in vitro and in vivo models of the disease. Furthermore, we show that this pathway can be modulated through the rational combination of two FDA-approved drugs ? trifluoperazine hydrochloride, a FOXO1 nuclear export inhibitor, and erlotinib, a small molecule inhibitor of EGFR signaling ? in TKI-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. These data further highlight the central importance of defining key signaling networks in cancer and the potential use of this information to identify clinically relevant modulators of treatment response. Furthermore, this combinatorial approach to drug development and administration reinforces an important paradigm: that rational drug design based on a thorough understanding of the specific molecular alterations that drive disease progression and treatment resistance may lead to more effective and less toxic drugs for the treatment of cancer. Methods. Cell culture, mice tumor samples, and patient sample cohort.. The HCC827, A549, and H1650 cell lines were purchased from ATCC. The H3255 cell line was a gift from Katerina Politi and Harold Varmus, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA. All cell lines were cultured according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. EGFR L858R-derived tumor samples (22) were provided by Katerina Politi and Harold Varmus. Pten/Mmac1 +/? heterozygous mice and K-Ras LA2 mice were obtained from the NCI Mouse Repository. At time of surgery, tumor samples were obtained by the surgeon and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen to avoid protease and/or phosphatase activity. Each specimen was then processed for banking by bisecting the specimen, placing one piece in a freezing tube, and immersing in liquid nitrogen; the other half was a \u00a1\u00b0mirror image\u00a1\u00b1 of the frozen specimen and was placed in formalin and used to make a paraffin tissue block. One H&E slide from the paraffin block was analyzed and assessed for the percentage of the specimen that was tumor. The time from release from operating room to the time of freezing was recorded for every sample analyzed; this interval was 30 minutes or less to prevent RNA and protein degradation. Chemicals.. Erlotinib was obtained from OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc./Astellas; AKT inhibitor MK-2206 from Selleck; MEK inhibitor AZD6244 from Selleck; and TFP from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were dissolved in DMSO at either 10 mM stock solution (erlotinib, MK-2206, and AZD6244) or 80 mM stock solution (TFP). Further dilutions to the required concentration were made in RPMI 1640 medium (Fisher Scientific). Antibodies.. Rabbit antibodies specific for p-EGFR (no. 2234), EGFR (no. 4405), L858R (no. 3197), p-AKT (no. 4058), AKT (no. 9272), p-ERK (no. 9272), ERK (no. 4695), cleaved caspase-3 (no. 9/661), p-FOXO1 (no. 2486), and FOXO1 (no. 2880) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit polyclonal KLF6 antibody (sc-7158), goat polyclonal actin antibody (sc-1616), and mouse monoclonal GAPDH antibody (sc-32233) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Rabbit polyclonal PARP antibody (G7341) was obtained from Promega. Somatic mutation PCR array.. DNA was isolated using DNeasy (QIAGEN) as per the supplier\u00a1\u00afs protocol. We carried out genomic mutation analysis of the cohort using the SABiosciences qBiomarker Somatic Mutation PCR array (QIAGEN) for the EGFR pathway. Common mutation analysis was performed for the following genes: AKT, BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, MEK1, PIK3CA, and PTEN. All mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing of the tumor DNA sample by an independent PCR reaction and confirmed to be somatic by sequencing of the matched normal sample for each patient. qRT-PCR.. RNA was isolated from cell lines and tumor samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) as per the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. For each PCR reaction, 1 \u00a5\u00ecg RNA was reverse transcribed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Each cDNA sample was subjected to sequence-specific partial amplification with specific primers and the SYBR green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI PRISM 7900HT plate-reader instrument. Expression levels of KLF6 mRNA were determined with validated KLF6-specific primer sequences as previously described (19). The following primers were also used: FOXO1 forward, 5\u00a1\u00c7-AAGGATAAGGGTGACAGCAACAG-3\u00a1\u00c7 and reverse, 5\u00a1\u00c7-TTGCTGTGTAGGGACAGATTATGAC-3\u00a1\u00c7; EGFR forward, 5\u00a1\u00c7-TCCTCTGGAGGCTGAGAAAA-3\u00a1\u00c7 and reverse, 5\u00a1\u00c7-GGGCTCTGGAGGAAAAGAAA-3\u00a1\u00c7. All values were normalized to GAPDH levels, 18S, and actin internal controls. Normalization to housekeeping genes.. All qRT-PCR experiments were normalized to 3 separate housekeeping genes, GAPDH, \u00a5\u00e2-actin, and 18S. This was to confirm that results were not due to variability within housekeeping gene expression. All experiments were performed in triplicate and independently validated with 3 biological replicates. The data presented in the figures represent analysis based on normalization to GAPDH unless otherwise stated. Similar results were obtained with normalization to \u00a5\u00e2-actin and 18S expression. All Western blots were normalized to GAPDH, \u00a5\u00e2-actin, and tubulin. Again, this was to confirm that results were not due to variability in housekeeping protein expression. The data presented in the figures represent densitometry analysis via ImageJ ( http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) normalized to GAPDH in cell line analysis and tubulin in analysis of tissues from mice. Again, similar results were obtained when protein expression was normalized to \u00a5\u00e2-actin and tubulin. All experiments were independently validated with 3 biological replicates. Plasmids and siRNAs.. AKTmyr and FOXO1 plasmids (Addgene) were transfected into cells by Lipofectamine 2000 incubation for 20 minutes per the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol. We transfected validated KLF6-specific siRNA (Dharmacon: ON-TARGETplus GCAGGAAAGUUUACACCAA) using HiPerFect (QIAGEN) into cell lines seeded at 60%?70% confluence. For transient FOXO1 inhibition, we used FOXO1A ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool from Dharmacon. For stable KLF6 inhibition, we designed pSUPER.retro.puro vectors (Oligoengine) encoding shRNA targeting KLF6 (CAAAAGCUCCCACUUGAAA). A pSUPER vector encoding Luciferase shRNA was used as a control. For stable FOXO1 inhibition, we used SMARTvector 2.0 lentiviral shRNA particles from Dharmacon. Knockdown and overexpression were assessed by Western blotting and qRT-PCR. KLF6 promoter assay.. HCC827 cells were cotransfected with 1 \u00a5\u00ecg pGL3-KLF6 promoter luciferase construct and pRL-TK plasmid (24) (as a control for transfection efficiency). Six hours after transfection, cells were treated with increasing doses of erlotinib. Twenty-four hours after treatment, we prepared cell lysates using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). We analyzed luciferase activity in 20 \u00a5\u00ecl lysate using a Modulus II Microplate Multimode Reader. Nuclear cytoplasmic fractionation.. HCC827 and H1650 cells were seeded and grown to 60%?70% confluence and treated with erlotinib and TFP/MK-2206, respectively. Cell lysates were extracted using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol. Clonogenic assay.. HCC827 shLuc and shKLF6 cells were plated at a low density in 6-well plates. After 24 hours, cells were treated with 50 nM erlotinib and incubated for 7 days. Cells were fixed and then stained with 1% crystal violet staining solution. Quantitation was completed using the cell counter function of ImageJ. TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry.. The ApopTag Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Millipore) was used according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol to perform TUNEL assays. Vectashield Mounting Medium with Propidium Iodide (Vector Laboratories) was used for counterstaining. Quantitation of images obtained from TUNEL was performed using NIS-Elements for Basic Sciences (NIKON). H&E staining was performed using standard procedures. Paraffin-embedded tumors were stained with anti-PCNA (FL-261, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), anti-FOXO1 (2880, Cell Signaling Technology), anti?p-AKT (4060, Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-KLF6 (sc-7158, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) antibodies. Briefly, sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohol washes, followed by antigen retrieval in a pressure cooker (Dako) in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0). Slides were blocked in normal goat serum (S-1000, Vector) incubated in primary antibody at 4\u00a1\u00c6C overnight. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (E0432, Dako) was used as secondary antibody. Staining was visualized using DAB, and slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. Immunohistochemistry was performed with the Dako Catalyzed Signal Amplification kit (K1500, Dako) for p-AKT, FOXO1, and KLF6 antibodies. Bright-field and fluorescent images were captured using a Stereoscope or Axioplan 2 IE microscope (Zeiss). Quantitation was completed using the cell counter function of ImageJ. Immunocytochemistry.. Cell lines were plated on glass coverslips at a density of 150,000 cells in complete RPMI medium. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 24 hours after plating and were incubated with FOXO1 (1:100) primary antibody (9454, Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 hour. After incubation with a secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000), (H+L) FITC conjugate (AP307F, Millipore), coverslips were mounted with Vectashield DAPI counterstain (H1200) and visualized under a fluorescence microscope. Analysis of apoptosis.. After the cells were either treated with a drug or transfected with siRNA, they were stained with propidium iodide to ascertain the DNA content and determine cell cycle distribution within the cell population as previously described (44). Sub-G 1 peaks were analyzed on DNA histograms; hypodiploid DNA represented dead cells. This fraction included apoptotic as well as necrotic cells. Annexin V staining was performed using Annexin V conjugate (Invitrogen, Alexa Fluor 488) and Annexin binding buffer (V13246, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol. Apoptosis was further validated by caspase-3 and PARP cleavage through Western blotting. Tumorigenicity assay.. We designed pSUPER.retro.puro vectors (Oligoengine) encoding shRNA targeting KLF6. A pSUPER vector encoding luciferase shRNA was used as a control. Stable cell lines of HCC827 were generated by retroviral transfection of the pSUPER-shLuciferase (shLuc) and pSUPER-shKLF6 (shKLF6) and selected with 2 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml puromycin as described previously (44). Polyclonal pools of the shRNA-infected cell lines were collected, and KLF6 knockdown was determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Stable cell lines (10 \u00a1\u00bf 10 7) were injected in the right flank of the 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu mice. Tumor volume was assessed weekly as previously described (44) until volumes reached an average of 100 mm 3. The following treatments were administered via intraperitoneal injection: vehicle (DMSO) and erlotinib (25 mg/kg). A total of 4 treatments were given, with a 48-hour rest period. H1650 cells (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6) were similarly injected into the right flank of 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu mice. Tumor volume was assessed weekly as previously described (44), until volumes reached an average of 200 mm 3. The following treatments were administered via intraperitoneal injection: vehicle control (DMSO), erlotinib (25 mg/kg), TFP (10 mg/kg), and combination erlotinib (25 mg/kg) and TFP (10 mg/kg). A total of 4 treatments were given, with a 48-hour rest period. Statistical analyses and densitometric analysis.. Enhanced chemiluminescent images of immunoblots were analyzed by scanning densitometry and quantified with NIH ImageJ software using the average of 3 independent measurements. All values were normalized to actin, tubulin, or GAPDH expression and expressed as fold change relative to control. Patient cohort analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. All statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS software statistical package, version 17.0. Statistical significance was assumed for a 2-tailed P value less than 0.05 using Students\u00a1\u00af t test or ANOVA with the Tukey post-hoc test (presented as means; error bars indicate SD). Except where otherwise noted, box boundaries of all box-and-whisker plots represent the range of values obtained in the experiment and whiskers represent mean \u00a1\u00be SD. Study approval.. All animal studies were approved by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine IACUC. Human tissue samples were obtained from the Mount Sinai BioBank under IRB approval. Supplementary Material.

                "text": "Impact of Combined mTOR and MEK Inhibition in Uveal Melanoma Is Driven by Tumor Genotype\tUveal melanomas possess activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. MAPK activation occurs via somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein subunits GNAQ and GNA11 for over 70% of tumors and less frequently via V600E BRAF mutations. In this report, we describe the impact of dual pathway inhibition upon uveal melanoma cell lines with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) and the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055. While synergistic reductions in cell viability were observed with AZD8055/selumetinib in both BRAF and GNAQ mutant cell lines, apoptosis was preferentially induced in BRAF mutant cells only. In vitro apoptosis assay results were predictive of in vivo drug efficacy as tumor regressions were observed only in a BRAF mutant xenograft model, but not GNAQ mutant model. We went on to discover that GNAQ promotes relative resistance to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis in GNAQ mutant cells. For BRAF mutant cells, both AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were modulated by the combination; however, decreasing AKT phosphorylation alone was not sufficient and decreasing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not required for apoptosis. Instead, cooperative mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and MEK inhibition resulting in downregulation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 was found to be critical for combination-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of combined MEK and mTOR kinase inhibition will be determined by tumor genotype, and that BRAF mutant malignancies will be particularly susceptible to this strategy. Introduction. Uveal melanoma is a primary intraocular malignancy that arises from melanocytes within the uveal tract, which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Over 50% of these patients develop incurable, metastatic disease for which there are no effective therapies [1]. 52% to 86% of uveal melanomas possess activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [2], [3]. In contrast to cutaneous melanomas, the relevance of BRAF (T1799A\u00a1\u00e6V600E) mutations for MAPK activation in uveal melanoma is less clear. Though initial studies of uveal melanoma tumor samples reported that BRAF mutations are rare [2]?[6], several groups have detected the mutation in a disproportionate number of uveal melanoma cell lines [3], [7]?[10]. Two studies utilizing more sensitive genetic approaches have reported higher rates of BRAF mutation and confirmed that the mutation can be limited to select areas within a tumor [10], [11]. The possibility that techniques to establish cell lines may preferentially select for BRAF mutant tumors also can not be excluded. For over 40% of uveal melanomas, MAPK activation is driven by mutation of GNAQ [12], a gene that encodes for the alpha subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein complex (\u00a5\u00e1\u00a5\u00e2\u00a5\u00e3) that mediates signaling between G-protein?coupled receptors (GPCRs) and downstream effectors. Mutation of codon 209 in the ras-like domain blocks intrinsic GTPase activity, keeping G\u00a5\u00e1 in a GTP-bound, constitutively active state. Recently, a mutation at Q209 in the GNAQ paralogue gene GNA11 that also activates MAPK signaling was discovered in over 30% of uveal melanomas [13]. Notably, recent clinical data has demonstrated modest preliminary signals of efficacy in uveal melanoma patients treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) [14]. It has been hypothesized that activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway cooperates with MAPK activation to generate and maintain the malignant phenotype in uveal melanomas. High rates of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway) locus and mutations within the PTEN coding region translates to more than half of uveal melanomas having decreased or complete loss of PTEN expression [15]. Pathway stimulation can also occur via activation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including c-kit, insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R), and c-met [1]. For inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling, effort has been put into targeting mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin), which is a serine/threonine kinase activated by the pathway. The drugs rapamycin and its analogues inhibit mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which includes mTOR and other regulatory proteins such as regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor). However, clinical activity with rapamycin and its analogues has been modest to date, and several molecular mechanisms potentially limiting clinical efficacy have been proposed, including: 1) incomplete mTORC1 inhibition, 2) activation of AKT by release of negative feedback pathways regulated by mTORC1 substrates and 3) minimal inhibition of a second rapamycin-resistant complex called mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which contains a protein called \u00a1\u00b0rapamycin-insensitive component of mTOR\u00a1\u00b1 (Rictor) instead of Raptor. mTORC2 is the protein dependent kinase 2 (PDK2) responsible for phosphorylating AKT at serine 473 [16], which in cooperation with threonine 308 phosphorylation results in full AKT activation. These limitations with mTORC1 inhibitors led to the development of ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR which effectively inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 [17]?[19]. In this study, we explored combined MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibition with an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, AZD8055, and the allosteric MEK inhibitor, selumetinib, in uveal melanoma cell lines of various genotypic backgrounds. AZD8055 potently inhibits the mTOR kinase in vitro (IC 50 of 0.8+/?0.2 nM), while exhibiting >1000 fold selectivity against closely related kinases such as PI3K, ATM, and DNA-PK, and no activity against a panel of 260 other kinases at a concentration of 10 \u00a5\u00ecM [17]. Selumetinib is a highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/2 that potently inhibits MEK1 in vitro with an IC 50 of 14.1+/?0.79 nM [20]. Utilizing these small molecule inhibitors, we found that the antitumor effectiveness of combined mTOR and MEK inhibition is dependent upon tumor genotype. Results. The AZD8055/selumetinib Combination Synergistically Inhibits BRAF and GNAQ Mutant Tumor Cell Viability. We investigated the impact of dual pathway inhibition with the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib and the mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 upon uveal melanoma cell lines of distinct tumor genotypes. This panel included two cell lines which lack activating mutations in BRAF, GNAQ, GNA11, and RAS (Mel290 and C918, referred to as \u00a1\u00b0wild type\u00a1\u00b1 or \u00a1\u00b0WT\u00a1\u00b1), two cell lines which possess the V600E BRAF mutation (OCM3 and OCM1A, referred to as \u00a1\u00b0BRAF\u00a1\u00b1), and two cell lines which possess activating GNAQ mutations at Q209 (92.1 (Q209L) and Mel270 (Q209P), referred to as \u00a1\u00b0GNAQ\u00a1\u00b1); these cell lines were otherwise negative for common mutations in several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), PIK3CA, and AKT1 (Table S1). PTEN protein expression was detectable by Western blot in all cell lines (Figure S8). The viability of cells treated with various concentrations of AZD8055 (0 to 1000 nM) and selumetinib (0 to 5000 nM) alone and in different combinations were evaluated (50% growth inhibitory values (GI50s) for each compound alone are depicted in Figure S1). In both GNAQ and BRAF cells, the AZD8055/selumetinib combination at different dose combinations consistently reduced cell viability by more than 50% (\u00a1\u00b0fractional activity\u00a1\u00b1 (Fa) >0.5) in a synergistic manner (combination index (CI) values <1) (Figure 1A). The interaction between the two drugs was not effective in WT cells as observed CI values ranged from slightly less than 1 to greater than 1 with lower Fa values than those observed in BRAF and GNAQ cells (Figure 1A). Selective mTOR and MEK Inhibition with AZD8055/selumetinib Induces Apoptosis Preferentially in BRAF Mutant Uveal Melanoma Cell Lines. We next investigated how differences in cellular viability correlated with apoptosis. 100 nM AZD8055 and 1000 nM selumetinib were utilized for this and all subsequent experiments after it was determined that these are the lowest concentrations that effectively inhibit mTOR and MEK, respectively, in cells (see Figure S2). Results from the apoptosis assays did not correlate with the findings from the viability assays. The AZD8055/selumetinib combination increased apoptosis over that observed with either drug alone only in BRAF cells (Figure 1B). GNAQ cells demonstrated a modest trend towards increased apoptosis with the combination and no increase in apoptosis was observed in the WT cells (Figure 1B). Quantification of apoptosis by Annexin V cell surface staining confirmed these findings (data not shown). The AZD8055/selumetinib Combination Induces in vivo Tumor Regression in a BRAF Mutant Xenograft Model, but not in a GNAQ Mutant Model. We hypothesized that the preferential induction of apoptosis with the combination in BRAF mutant cells suggests that combined mTOR and MEK inhibition may be particularly effective for this tumor genotype. To evaluate this in vivo, we tested AZD8055 and selumetinib in both a BRAF mutant (OCM1A) and GNAQ mutant (92.1) xenograft tumor model. In the BRAF mutant model, the combination resulted in tumor regressions at Day 19 with tumor volumes that were lower than those achieved with either drug alone (Figure 2A, p-value=0.008 for the comparison of the combination to either AZD8055 or selumetinib alone). Ki67 and TUNEL tumor tissue staining performed after five doses of drug treatment revealed that the combination both decreased tumor proliferation and induced apoptosis (Figure 2A; see Figures S3A for the immunohistochemistry (IHC) images). In the GNAQ mutant model, only a non-statistically significant trend towards enhanced tumor growth inhibition with the combination was achieved; neither tumor regression nor changes in Ki67 and TUNEL staining were observed (Figure 2B and Figure S3B). Hence, we concluded that the in vitro apoptosis assay results were more predictive of in vivo drug effectiveness than the in vitro viability data, and we subsequently focused our efforts upon investigating the mechanism(s) by which these drugs elicit distinct apoptotic outcomes in the BRAF and GNAQ mutant uveal tumor genotypes. GNAQ Mediates Relative Resistance to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced Apoptosis in GNAQ Mutant Cells. Given the modest level of apoptosis observed in GNAQ cells, we hypothesized that GNAQ activation may mediate relative resistance to apoptosis induced by combined mTOR and MEK inhibition. In order to determine if GNAQ is necessary to block AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis, GNAQ expression was suppressed with pooled small interfering RNA (siRNA) constructs in the GNAQ mutant cell line 92.1 (Figure 3A). While suppression of GNAQ expression alone only modestly increased apoptosis, the combination induced higher levels of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage (Figure 3A) and substantially increased the sub-G1 fraction (Figure 3B) in GNAQ siRNA-transfected cells compared to control siRNA-transfected cells (sub-G1 percentages of 16.0% versus 4.7%, respectively). Hence, in these cells GNAQ is essential for countering apoptosis induced by combined MEK and mTOR inhibition. Persistent AKT Phosphorylation in AZD8055-treated BRAF Mutant Cells is Mediated by IGF-1R Activation in a MEK-dependent Manner. To investigate how AZD8055/selumetinib preferentially elicits apoptosis in BRAF mutant cells, we assessed the impact of the combination upon the phosphorylation status of mTOR and MEK substrates. In WT cells, AZD8055 inhibited phosphorylation of both the mTORC1 substrate S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) and the mTORC2 substrate AKT (at serine 473; Figure 4A, lane 2 of Blots #1 and 2); selumetinib, however, failed to inhibit ERK phosphorylation in a sustained manner (Figure 4A, lane 3 of Blot #3) due to rebound ERK phosphorylation (see Figure S2D and the accompanying figure legend for the selumetinib time course experiment demonstrating this phenomenon). This lack of sustained target inhibition is one possible explanation for the lack of cooperative antitumor effect observed with the combination in these cells. Additionally, AKT phosphorylation was slightly increased with selumetinib in only these cells (Figure 4A, lane 3 of Blot #1). In BRAF and GNAQ cells, AZD8055 potently suppressed S6K1 phosphorylation, but failed to completely inhibit AKT phosphorylation (Figure 4A, lane 2 of Blots #1 and #2; Figure S2A). This was not due to ineffective mTORC2 inhibition, but instead rebound AKT phosphorylation: while 100 nM AZD8055 inhibited AKT phosphorylation after 2 hours in all three tumor genotypes, by 24 hours AKT phosphorylation rebounded only in BRAF and GNAQ cells (Figure S2C). Interestingly, the addition of selumetinib to AZD8055 substantially decreased AKT phosphorylation in BRAF cells, but not significantly in GNAQ cells (Figure 4A, lane 4 of Blot #1). Given evidence in other systems that the release of negative feedback pathways resulting in AKT phosphorylation represents a critical mechanism of intrinsic resistance to mTORC1 inhibition [21], we investigated the mechanism by which AKT is modulated by AZD8055/selumetinib. Utilizing an RTK array assay, we found that mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition with AZD8055 in the BRAF mutant cell line OCM1A increased phosphorylation of the insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) (Figure 4B). The addition of selumetinib to AZD8055 decreased the IGF-1R phosphorylation signal (Figure 4B). These results suggest that inhibition of IGF-1R activity may be one mechanism downstream of MEK/ERK inhibition by which selumetinib inhibits AZD8055-induced, rebound AKT phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the small molecule inhibitor NVP-AEW541 [22] to directly inhibit IGF-1R in OCM1A cells. At 1000 nM, NVP-AEW541 inhibited IGF-1R phosphorylation induced by serum or IGF-1 ligand alone (Figure S4). In combination with AZD8055, NVP-AEW541 suppressed AKT re-phosphorylation without impacting ERK phosphorylation (Figure 4C, lane 6), consistent with the model that IGF-1R activation regulates AKT downstream of MEK/ERK activity in these cells. However, despite modulating AKT phosphorylation, the addition of NVP-AEW541 to AZD8055 was insufficient to induce apoptosis as assayed by PARP cleavage and quantifying sub-G1 cell populations (Figure 4C, lane 6 and Figure 4D, respectively). Hence, while selumetinib suppresses AZD8055-mediated activation of the IGF-1R/AKT axis, modulation of these targets alone is not sufficient for the apoptosis induced by the AZZD8055/selumetinib combination, implying that other target(s) downstream of selumetinib-mediated ERK inhibition is (are) critical for the induction of apoptosis. AZD8055/selumetinib Inhibition of 4E-BP1 Phosphorylation in BRAF Mutant Cells also does not Contribute to Apoptosis. 4E-BP1 (eIF4E binding protein-1) has recently been implicated as the key protein target cooperatively modulated by an AKT and MEK inhibitor combination to induce apoptosis in tumors harboring both RAS and PIK3CA mutations [23]. Therefore, we investigated the potential role of 4E-BP1 in AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis for BRAF mutant uveal melanomas. 4E-BP1 is an mTORC1 substrate that negatively regulates translation by binding and blocking the function of eIF4E, an initiation factor that binds to the 5\u00a1\u00c7 mRNA cap structure to promote mRNA translation. mTORC1 activity leads to 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at several sites (T37/T46, S65 and T70 [24]), which results in 4E-BP1 dissociation from eIF4E and activation of cap-dependent translation [25]. Phosphorylation at all the 4E-BP1 sites assayed was inhibited with AZD8055 alone in WT cells. In the GNAQ mutant cell line 92.1 and BRAF mutant cell line OCM1A, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at T37/46 was only modestly suppressed by AZD8055; phosphorylation at S65 and T70 was more effectively inhibited by AZD8055 in these cells (Figure 5A). The addition of selumetinib further suppressed 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at T37/46 in only BRAF cells, not GNAQ cells (Figure 5A). However, an mRNA cap binding assay demonstrated that this further reduction in T37/46 phosphorylation did not increase the capacity for 4E-BP1 to associate with m 7 GTP Sepharose beads (which mimics the 5\u00a1\u00c7 cap of untranslated mRNAs) in the BRAF cells, suggesting no significant change upon 4E-BP1 function (Figure 5B). Furthermore, pooled siRNA construct-mediated downregulation of 4E-BP1 (which reportedly protected tumors cells from apoptosis induced by combined AKT and MEK inhibition [23]) failed to reduce PARP cleavage induced by the combination, confirming that 4E-BP1 is not an essential regulator of apoptosis in BRAF mutant cells (Figure 5C, lane 4 versus lane 8). Combined mTORC2 Suppression and MEK Inhibition with Selumetinib is Sufficient to Induce Apoptosis in BRAF Mutant Cells. We next compared the impact upon mutant BRAF cell apoptosis of mTORC1 versus mTORC2 inhibition in combination with selumetinib MEK inhibition. First, AZD8055 effects were compared to those of rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor. As predicted, rapamycin suppressed mTORC1 substrate phosphorylation and increased AKT phosphorylation (presumably via release of negative feedback regulation), which was incompletely reduced by selumetinib (Figure 6A). Less apoptosis (Figure 6B) and PARP cleavage (Figure 6A, lane 4 versus 6)) was observed with the rapamycin/selumetinib combination compared to the AZD8055/selumetinib combination. Hence, mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin alone is not sufficient to replicate the apoptosis produced with AZD8055. mTOR has been shown to stimulate cell survival by promoting expression of myeloid leukemia sequence-1 (MCL-1), a pro-survival member of the bcl-2 family of genes [26]. In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer cells, MCL-1 downregulation by a PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor in combination with BIM upregulation (a pro-apoptotic member of the bcl-2 family) by a MEK inhibitor has been shown to be critical for the induction of apoptosis [27]. We investigated whether or not differences in the regulation of MCL-1 and BIM levels correlated with the differences in apoptosis observed in this study. In all contexts, BIM was upregulated with selumetinib (Figure 6A, lanes 2, 4, and 6), consistent with previously published data [28], [29]. While all the drugs alone reduced MCL-1 levels to some degree, the AZD8055/selumetinib combination cooperatively reduced MCL-1 to the lowest levels observed with any condition (Figure 6A, lane 4); the rapamycin/selumetinib combination failed to further decrease MCL-1 levels over that observed with either drug alone (Figure 6A, lane 4 versus 6). Taking a previously published approach [30], we next utilized pooled siRNA constructs targeting Raptor and Rictor to evaluate whether the inhibition of mTORC1 or mTORC2 in isolation, respectively, is sufficient to recapitulate the MCL-1 and apoptosis effects observed with AZD8055. Partial Rictor downregulation was achieved with a concomitant decrease in MCL-1 levels compared to control siRNA-transfected cells (Figure 6C, lane 2 versus 1). Alternatively, partial suppression of Raptor expression failed to reduce MCL-1 levels relative to control siRNA-transfected cells (Figure 6C, lane 1 versus 3). With the addition of selumetinib, cells with suppressed Rictor levels achieved modestly lower MCL-1 levels and BIM upregulation, resulting in an induction of apoptosis as indicated by the appearance of cleaved PARP that was not observed with raptor siRNA (Figure 6C, lane 5). These observations suggest that in BRAF mutant uveal melanoma the modulation of MCL-1 levels and apoptosis by AZD8055 in combination with selumetinib may be dependent upon mTORC2, not mTORC1, inhibition. AZD8055/selumetinib-induced Apoptosis in BRAF Mutant Cells is Dependent Upon Reducing MCL-1 Levels. We went on to examine the levels of MCL-1 and BIM expressed in several uveal melanoma cell lines following exposure to AZD8055 and selumetinib (Figure 7A). While selumetinib upregulated BIM levels in WT, BRAF, and GNAQ cells, only in the BRAF mutant OCM1A cell line was the level of MCL-1 decreased by AZD8055 and selumetinib cooperatively (Figure 7A). To explore if MCL-1 downregulation in BRAF cells is sufficient to induce apoptosis in combination with selumetinib, MCL-1 levels in OCM1A cells were reduced with pooled siRNA constructs. Transfection of MCL-1 targeting siRNAs reduced MCL-1 expression (relative to an unrelated control siRNA) to a level comparable to that observed with AZD8055 alone (Figure 7B). While selumetinib in combination with the control siRNA downregulated MCL-1 and increased BIM levels, it was only with further MCL-1 suppression achieved with the targeting siRNAs that the addition of selumetinib induced apoptosis as detected by increased PARP cleavage (Figure 7B). We next transfected into OCM1A cells a plasmid driving MCL-1 expression under the control of a constitutively active viral promoter in order to determine if MCL-1 downregulation is necessary for AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis (Figure 7C). Overexpression of MCL-1 rescued cells from apoptosis induced by the combination, decreasing the apoptosis fraction of OCM1A cells from 15.5% in vector-transfected cells to 10.9% in MCL-1-transfected cells (Figure 7C). We also analyzed MCL-1 transfected cells by bi-parametric flow cytometry for both DNA content and MCL-1 levels to separate out low- and high-expressing MCL-1 cells and then compare the differences in sub-G1 percentage between these two subsets (Figure 7D and Figure S5). This analysis revealed that apoptosis was induced with the combination only in the subset of cells expressing lower levels of MCL-1, while the drug combination failed to induce more apoptosis than that observed with selumetinib alone in the high MCL-1 expressers (Figure 7D and Figure S5). In the xenograft model of the BRAF mutant cell line OCM1A, Western analysis of frozen tumor tissue revealed that cooperative MCL-1 downregulation and increased BIM levels were also achieved in vivo (Figure S6). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that MCL-1 downregulation is both necessary and sufficient to induce apoptosis with selumetinib, and strongly argues that MCL-1 is a singular target that is cooperatively modulated by the combination to induce apoptosis in BRAF mutant uveal melanoma. Discussion. Concomitant activation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways in tumor cells confers relative resistance to drugs targeting either pathway in isolation. AKT activation in BRAF mutant cutaneous melanomas mediates resistance to MEK inhibition with selumetinib [31]. BRAF and RAS mutations mediate resistance to AKT targeted agents [23]. Alternatively, drug combinations that inhibit both pathways may be more clinically effective for tumors with evidence of dual pathway activation, including those with RTK mutation/activation [27], [32], other genetic alterations of the pathway (RAS, PIK3CA, BRAF mutations and/or PTEN loss) [23], [28], [33]?[37], or simply expression of phosphorylated AKT or ERK [31], [38]. In this study, we found that uveal cancer cell fate in response to combined MEK and mTOR inhibition was closely correlated to tumor genotype. AZD8055/selumetinib did not confer cooperative antitumor effects in WT cells, possibly related to incomplete suppression of MAPK activity with selumetinib. Alternatively, the combination did synergistically suppress the viability of both BRAF and GNAQ mutant cells; however, apoptosis was only induced in BRAF mutant cells. Ultimately, in vitro measurement of apoptosis correlated better than cell viability to in vivo effectiveness as tumor regressions were observed only in the BRAF mutant xenograft model. These distinct drug induced fates may in fact reflect biologic differences in how BRAF and GNAQ mutations activate MAPK signaling: while the former directly activates MEK\u00a1\u00e6ERK activity, the latter does so via protein kinase C (PKC) activation which can mediate cell survival signals via several pathways parallel to MAPK [1]. The observation that suppression of GNAQ expression in GNAQ mutant cells predisposes to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis argues that GNAQ activity in these cells activates MEK- and mTOR- independent pro-survival signals. Further elucidation of the differences in drug-induced outcomes for GNAQ and BRAF mutant uveal melanomas revealed that AKT, 4E-BP1, and MCL-1 were cooperatively regulated by the AZD8055/selumetinib combination only in BRAF mutant cells and not GNAQ cells (Figure 8A), suggesting these as candidate targets responsible for the distinct apoptotic outcomes observed. In fact, activation of RTKs (including IGF-1R), AKT, and 4E-BP1 have each been implicated as critical mechanisms of resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition in other systems [23], [31], [39]?[41]. Establishing apoptosis as an important cellular outcome that correlates to in vivo anti-tumor effects in our model allowed us to critically evaluate whether the biochemical modulation of any of these molecules are truly critical for the anti-tumor effects elicited with dual pathway inhibition. Our data revealed that while 4E-BP1 is cooperatively regulated by AZD8055/selumetinib, this is not critical for the induction of apoptosis in BRAF mutant uveal melanoma cells. Selumetinib suppression of AZD8055-mediated activation of the IGF-1R/AKT axis alone is also not sufficient to induce apoptosis in these cells. Instead, AZD8055 suppression of mTORC2 cooperates with selumetinib to reduce MCL-1 protein expression, a change that in combination with selumetinib-mediated induction of BIM, is essential for combination-induced apoptosis (Figure 8B). In the context of recent data arguing that the superior in vitro effects of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors over rapamycin are related primarily to more effective mTORC1 targeting rather than mTORC2 inhibition [17]?[19], the findings presented here also argue that mTORC2 may still be a relevant therapeutic target. In EGFR mutant lung cancer cells, inhibition of PI3K/mTOR and MEK were directly linked to MCL-1 downregulation and BIM upregulation, respectively [27]. In this study, MCL-1 downregulation correlated with cooperative inhibition of AKT phosphorylation in BRAF cells, suggesting that concomitant MEK and AKT inhibition may be essential for altering both BIM and MCL-1 levels to induce apoptosis in these cells as well (Figure 8B). We also observed that dual MEK and AKT inhibition can be achieved by combining selumetinib with the IGF-1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541, and also resulted in decreased MCL-1, increased BIM, and induction of apoptosis (Figure S7). Hence, different targeted approaches may achieve the dual pathway inhibition that can impact BIM/MCL-1 levels and induce apoptosis in BRAF mutant cells. What remains unknown is how differences in uveal melanoma PTEN status may influence drug susceptibility independent of GNAQ and BRAF mutation status. We did observe that BRAF mutant cell lines had overall less PTEN protein expression compared to WT or GNAQ cells, though this did not result in baseline differences of AKT or S6K1 phosphorylation (Figure S8A). Since PTEN null uveal melanoma cell lines are not currently available [42], the contribution of PTEN status to drug susceptibility can not be fully addressed. We did investigate how siRNA-mediated depletion of PTEN expression in the GNAQ cell line 92.1 impacted drug-induced apoptosis and found this did not change the drug effects upon the relevant signaling pathways or MCL-1 levels (Figure S8B). Though there was also no statistically significant increase in apoptosis with PTEN siRNA compared to control siRNA transfected cells, we did observe a very small trend towards higher apoptosis with the selumetinib/AZD8055 combination in cells with suppressed PTEN expression (Figure S8B). We concluded that while PTEN status may modestly influence the induction of apoptosis, it does so in a manner distinct from the MCL-1 dependent mechanism we have delineated for BRAF mutant cells, though further study regarding the contribution of PTEN status apart from BRAF or GNAQ mutations is warranted. One question stemming from this study is how applicable the efficacy of combined mTOR and MEK inhibition may be for other BRAF mutant malignancies. We have evaluated the AZD8055/selumetinib combination in cutaneous melanomas and have found that the combination preferentially induced apoptosis in most BRAF mutant cell lines (3 out of 4 lines tested), but not N-RAS mutant cells or cells lacking these mutations (Figure S9), supporting observations from Gopal et. al. [31]. For GNAQ mutant cells, further study is warranted to develop more effective GNAQ targeting strategies in order to achieve better therapeutic efficacy. Methods. Chemicals.

Xenograft Studies. 8-week-old nu/nu SCID male mice bearing subcutaneously injected OCM1A or 92.1 tumors (7 mice/cohort) of \u00a1\u00ad100 mm 3 diameter were treated orally (p.o.) with vehicle, AZD8055 (20 mg/kg/d), and/or selumetinib (25 mg/kg/d) as single agents and in combination, 5 days/week for 3 weeks. After the fifth treatment, two animals from each cohort were sacrificed and the tumors were assessed by hematoxylin & eosin staining (H&E), Ki67 staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and Western blot as previously described [53]. Mice in the control groups were treated with a 0.5% HPMC +0.1% Tween 80 control solution. Tumors were measured every 2 to 3 days with calipers and tumor volumes were calculated and expressed in cubic millimeter and calculated using the formula p/6 \u00a1\u00bf (large diameter) \u00a1\u00bf (small diameter). Toxicity was monitored by weight loss. At the end of the study, mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation.

(TIF) Figure S2. Impact of AZD8055 and selumetinib upon MAPK and AKT/mTOR pathway signaling. A, Western blot of S6K1, AKT, and ERK phosphorylation following AZD8055 for 24 hours. B, Western blot of ERK and AKT phosphorylation following exposure to selumetinib for 24 hours. C, AKT phosphorylation over time with 100 nM AZD8055. D, ERK phosphorylation over time with 1000 nM selumetinib. Interpretation: For AZD8055, 100 nM was the lowest concentration to suppress phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) at 24 hours in all the cell lines (Figure S2A). 100 nM AZD8055 impacted the phosphorylation of mTORC2 substrate AKT (at S473) more variably as BRAF and GNAQ, but not WT, cells retained phosphorylated AKT at levels approximating those in vehicle-treated cells (Figure S2A). This was due to rebound AKT phosphorylation: 100 nM AZD8055 inhibited AKT phosphorylation at 2 hours in all three genotypes and by 24 hours AKT phosphorylation rebounded only in BRAF and GNAQ cells (Figure S2C). This implies that a PDK2 other than mTORC2 may be re-activated after prolonged AZD8055 exposure. Interestingly, higher concentrations of AZD8055 inhibited AKT phosphorylation (Figure S2A), which we concluded represented off-target activity given 1) effective mTORC2 inhibition in all the cell lines at 2 hours with 100 nM AZD8055, and 2) discordance between inhibition of AKT and S6K1 phosphorylation in BRAF cells (a discrepancy not observed in WT cells), confirming that mTOR inhibition occurs at concentrations as low as 20 nM in BRAF cells. While rebound AKT phosphorylation was accompanied by rebound S6K1 phosphorylation in the GNAQ mutant cell line, this was not observed in the BRAF mutant cell line, suggesting different mechanism of rebound phosphorylation may exist. For selumetinib, 1000 nM was the lowest concentration that inhibited phosphorylation of the MEK substrates ERK1/2 at 2 hours, but rebound ERK phosphorylation occurred preferentially in WT cells after 24 hours (Figure S2D).

                "text": "Activation of the AXL Kinase Causes Resistance to EGFR-Targeted Therapy in Lung Cancer\tHuman NSCLCs with activating mutations in EGFR frequently respond to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib but responses are not durable as tumors acquire resistance. Secondary mutations in EGFR (T790M) or upregulation of the MET kinase are found in over 50% of resistant tumors. Here, we report increased activation of AXL and evidence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in multiple in vitro and in vivo EGFR-mutant lung cancer models with erlotinib acquired resistance in the absence of EGFR T790M or MET activation. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of AXL restored sensitivity to erlotinib in these tumor models. Increased expression of AXL, and in some cases its ligand GAS6, was found in EGFR-mutant lung cancers obtained from patients with EGFR TKI acquired resistance. These data identify AXL as a promising therapeutic target whose inhibition could prevent or overcome EGFR TKI acquired resistance in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients. Introduction. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has served as a model for genotype-directed targeted cancer therapy. NSCLC patients whose tumors harbor activating kinase domain mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) often initially respond to treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as erlotinib. 1 ? 4However, acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment invariably develops. 5 , 6 There is no effective therapy for patients who develop such resistance. Work by our group and others has shown that resistance to EGFR TKI treatment can occur through a secondary resistance mutation in EGFR (T790M), activation of the MET kinase, and activation of the NF-kB pathway. 7 ? 11. 12The mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment are unknown in over 40% of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. Recent studies indicate that multiple resistance mechanisms may operate within an individual tumor to promote EGFR TKI acquired resistance in NSCLC patients. For example, the EGFR T790M resistance mutation and activation of MET can co-occur in some EGFR-mutant NSCLCs with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment. 13 ,12 Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that the acquisition of EGFR TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs may be associated not only with genotypic alterations but also histological changes that occur during adaptation to therapy. 14 By studying human EGFR-mutant NSCLC tumor models and clinical specimens we aimed to: 1) identify novel mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment, and 2) further clarify the extent to which distinct and co-existent genotypic and histological changes promote the acquisition of EGFR TKI treatment resistance in NSCLC patients. Results. AXL promotes resistance in vivo and in vitro. To identify novel mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment, our 3 groups independently established new in vivo and in vitro (n=5) models of acquired resistance to the EGFR TKI erlotinib using EGFR exon 19 deletion mutant (delE746-A750) HCC827 human NSCLC cells. HCC827 cells are initially sensitive to erlotinib treatment (in vitro IC 50 ~5nM) and we and others have used them to develop in vitro models of EGFR TKI acquired resistance in studies that have led to the identification of clinically relevant mechanisms of EGFR TKI resistance. 10 , 11 To establish the in vivo model, cohorts of 5 mice (2 tumors/mouse) with established HCC827 tumors were treated with vehicle or 4 escalating doses of erlotinib(from 6.25 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day) over ~ 5 months to derive erlotinib-resistant tumors. Erlotinib treatment of HCC827 xenograft tumors (10 tumors/dose, daily treatment) resulted in an initial dose-dependent decrease in tumor volume and the subsequent development of acquired resistance (>25% re-growth from max reduction) after 6?10 weeks of treatment in each tumor (Figure 1a, Table 1).Sequencing of EGFR in each erlotinib resistant tumor showed that none harbored the EGFR T790M mutation nor other secondary mutations in EGFR associated with erlotinib resistance (D761Y, L474S, T854A) (data not shown). To examine whether the erlotinib resistant tumors harbored increased expression of either known or potential novel drivers of resistance, we conducted microarray expression profiling of 17 xenograft tumors across each treatment group as well as 2 vehicle treated control tumors. We asked which genes were differentially regulated in the erlotinib resistant tumors compared to the control tumors (unpaired T-test, P<0.05). The analysis showed that 21 genes were increased (\u00a1\u00c31 log 2 fold change) specifically in the erlotinib resistant tumors (Supplementary Table 1). Unexpectedly, we found that the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL was the most highly overexpressed gene in the tumors with acquired erlotinib resistance (Supplementary Table 1). Consistent with prior studies 9 , 13, we also observed that MET was among the genes upregulated, although to a much lesser extent that AXL. We found increased mRNA expression of MET (\u00a1\u00c31 log 2 fold change) in 5/17 (29%) of the tumors with erlotinib acquired resistance (Figure 1b, Supplementary Table 2). The analysis did not identify overexpression of IGF-1R, Ras, or EGFR in the erlotinib-resistant tumors (Supplementary Tables 1, 2). Compared to control tumors, expression of AXL was increased (\u00a1\u00c31 log 2 fold change) in 15/17 (88%) of the tumors with erlotinib resistance (Figure 1c, Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, we also found increased expression (\u00a1\u00c3 1 log 2 fold change) of GAS6, the ligand for AXL, in 8/17 (47%) of the tumors with erlotinib resistance (Figure 1d, Supplementary Table 2). AXL was overexpressed in each tumor that had increased MET or GAS6 levels. In 10 of the 15 tumors (66.6%) with AXL upregulation, MET overexpression was not observed. In each tumor in which AXL and MET were both increased AXL was overexpressed to a higher degree. AXL and GAS6 overexpression was unique to treatment resistant tumors and was not the result of acute effects of erlotinib treatment as their levels were not increased in erlotinib-sensitive tumors harvested after 48h of erlotinib treatment (Supplementary Figure 1). aCGH analysis showed that neither AXL or GAS6 was amplified and sequencing of AXL revealed that it was not mutated in the erlotinib resistant tumors (data not shown). Based on these findings and recent data demonstrating that AXL can promote cell growth in several cancer cell lines 15 , 16, we hypothesized that AXL overexpression and activation may promote acquired resistance to erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. AXL has been previously associated with EMT and recent studies suggest that therapeutic resistance may, in some cases, be associated with histological changes including EMT in NSCLCs. 14 , 17 , 18 We noted that the tumor xenografts with acquired erlotinib resistance harbored alterations in the expression level of several genes that are established biomarkers of EMT. For example, we found increased levels of COL6A1 (a type IV collagen), HMGA1 and HMGA2 and decreased levels of keratin genes (including KRT6A, KRT14, KRT5) (Supplementary Table 1) in the tumors with acquired erlotinib resistance compared with the control tumors. We further examined whether the erlotinib resistant xenograft tumors exhibit molecular changes known to occur during EMT. Indeed, we found downregulation of E-cadherin (\u00a1\u00c30.5 log 2 fold change) in 8/15 (53%) (Figure 1e, Supplementary Table 2), upregulation of COL6A1 (\u00a1\u00c31 log 2 fold change) in 14/15 (93%) (Figure 1f, Supplementary Table 2) and increased vimentin (\u00a1\u00c31 log 2 fold change) in 10/15 (66%) (Supplementary Figure 2) of the erlotinib-resistant tumors with AXL overexpression compared to the vehicle treated control tumors. Consistent with the microarray data, we found increased levels of AXL and phosphorylated (p) AXL proteins in representative resistant HCC827 tumor xenografts at each dose of erlotinib compared with vehicle-treated tumors (Figure 2a). We did not find alterations in the levels of IGF-1R, pIGF-1R, or Ras in the erlotinib resistant tumors (Figure 2a). In contrast, we observed decreased levels of pEGFR, pErbB3, and pMET in response to erlotinib treatment both in sensitive tumors harvested at 48h of treatment (Figure 2b) and in resistant tumors at each dose of erlotinib compared to vehicle treated tumors (Figure 2a). Erlotinib treatment for 48h decreased pAKT, pERK, and pRelA and increased Parp cleavage in sensitive tumors (a marker of apoptosis) (Figure 2b) but pAKT, pERK, pRelA levels were maintained in each tumor with acquired erlotinib resistance (Figure 2a). Furthermore, we observed increased expression of the EMT marker vimentin in several erlotinib-resistant tumors (Figure 2a). These data suggest that AXL upregulation may activate AKT, MAPK or NF-kB signaling to promote resistance to erlotinib treatment in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs perhaps in association with an EMT. AXL inhibition restores erlotinib sensitivity. To determine whether inhibition of AXL may restore erlotinib sensitivity in vivo, we took a genetic approach because the pharmacokinetics and specificity of currently available AXL inhibitors in vivo are suboptimal. We generated xenograft tumors in immunocompromised mice using either parental HCC827 cells or an erlotinib resistant subclone of HCC827 cells that we established, which we found to express increased levels of AXL (HCC827 subline \u00a1\u00b0ER1\u00a1\u00b1, discussed further below). We transduced the AXL-overexpressing HCC827 ER1 cells with either a non-targeting shRNA or an shRNA targeting AXL prior to engraftment into the mice and then treated them with either vehicle or erlotinib (12.5 mg/kg/day). As expected, the parental HCC827 tumors were sensitive to erlotinib treatment whereas the AXL-overexpressing HCC827ER1 tumors transduced with the non-target shRNA were erlotinib-resistant (Figure 2c). In contrast, knockdown of AXL restored sensitivity to erlotinib in the HCC827 ER1 tumors (Figure 2c?d). The data show that AXL was required for erlotinib resistance in this in vivo model. To further explore the role of AXL in EGFR TKI acquired resistance we next focused on the novel in vitro models of erlotinib acquired resistance that we generated in conjunction with the in vivo tumor xenograft models. Five erlotinib resistant HCC827 clonal sublines were established (\u00a1\u00b0ER\u00a1\u00b1 1?5) independently in 3 laboratories, each with an erlotinib IC 50> 10 \u00a5\u00ecM, through prolonged (>5 months) and continuous exposure to erlotinib (Figure 3a). Each of these cell lines was also resistant to the irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitor BIBW2992 (afatinib) (Supplementary Figure 3). Thus resistance in these cellular models is unlikely a consequence of the secondary drug resistance mutation (T790M) in EGFR and is generalizable to distinct classes of EGFR TKIs. Indeed, the EGFR T790M resistance mutation was not detected by sequencing in any ER subline (data not shown). We sought to determine whether AXL or other genes previously implicated in EGFR TKI acquired resistance were upregulated in the HCC827 ER1-5 sublines compared to parental cells. To identify genes that were differentially regulated (threshold 3-fold change, FDR<0.1) in the context of erlotinib acquired resistance, we profiled the ER1-3 sublines as compared to parental HCC827 cells by genome-wide microarrays (Supplementary Table 3) and validated our findings by Q RT PCR and western blots in all 5 sublines. First, we noted that expression of EGFR, MET, IGF-1R, pIGF-1R and Ras was unaltered in each ER subline (Figure 3b). We did not detect activating mutations in K-Ras or BRAF by sequencing in the ER sublines (data not shown). Consistent with our findings in the erlotinib resistant tumor xenografts, we found significant upregulation of AXL and its ligand GAS6 in each HCC827 ER subline compared to HCC827 parental cells (Figure 3b, Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Figure 4). We also found increased expression of vimentin and decreased expression of E-cadherin in each ER subline (Figure 3b,Supplementary Figure 4). Neither somatic mutations in nor genomic amplification of AXL were found by sequencing and aCGH (or FISH), respectively, in the HCC827 ER sublines (data not shown). We next asked whether AXL overexpression and activation was necessary for erlotinib acquired resistance in vitro by genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting AXL in the HCC827 ER sublines. First we found that knockdown of AXL using an AXL siRNA had no effect on erlotinib sensitivity in parental HCC827 cells but restored erlotinib sensitivity in each ER subline (Figure 3c). Interestingly, we found that knockdown of GAS6 restored erlotinib sensitivity in the ER1 and ER2 sublines but not in the ER3, ER4 or ER5 sublines (Figure 3c). This observation is reminiscent of recent data showing that upregulation of the MET ligand HGF can promote resistance to gefitinib treatment in some EGFR mutant NSCLC cells. 10 Because we observed residual, albeit diminished, levels of pMET in some of the ER sublines, we asked whether MET knockdown by siRNA could restore erlotinib sensitivity in this system. We found that knockdown of MET did not significantly affect erlotinib sensitivity either in parental or HCC827 ER1 cells or further enhance the effects of AXL knockdown on erlotinib sensitivity in ER1 cells (Supplementary Figure 5). Treatment with a monoclonal antibody against AXL was recently shown to sensitize NSCLC cell lines that express wild type (WT) EGFR to erlotinib. 19 Thus we asked whether knockdown of AXL by siRNA enhances erlotinib sensitivity in 5 NSCLC cell lines with WT EGFR (A549, H460, H1573, H2009, Calu-1). We found that AXL knockdown had no effect on erlotinib sensitivity in these cell lines (Supplementary Figure 6). Our data suggest that inhibition of AXL enhances erlotinib sensitivity specifically in the context of NSCLCs with EGFR kinase domain activating mutations in cells with acquired EGFR TKI resistance. Next we sought to validate our genetic findings using 2 commercially available small molecule inhibitors of AXL, MP-470 and XL-880. 15 As expected, treatment with MP-470 (1 \u00a5\u00ecM) or XL-880 (1 \u00a5\u00ecM) alone did not significantly affect the viability of HCC827 parental or ER cells (Supplementary Figure 7). In contrast, we found that treatment with MP-470 (1 \u00a5\u00ecM) or XL-880 (1 \u00a5\u00ecM), restored sensitivity to concurrent erlotinib treatment in each ER subline (Figure 3d). To determine whether treatment with an AXL inhibitor is synergistic with concurrent erlotinib treatment we conducted combination index (CI) analysis in 2 of the ER sublines (ER1 and ER4). We found that treatment with either MP470 or XL880, but not the MET inhibitor PHA665752, was synergistic with concurrent erlotinib treatment (Supplementary Figure 8). Together, the genetic and pharmacologic data show that AXL is required for acquired erlotinib resistance in this system. We aimed to determine which signaling events downstream of AXL might promote acquired erlotinib resistance in EGFR mutant NSCLCs. Because AXL has been shown to activate the MAPK, AKT and NF-kB pathways and regulate apoptosis in some cancer cell lines 15 , 16, we examined activation of these pathways in HCC827 parental or ER cell lines treated with a non-targeting or AXL siRNA and either vehicle or erlotinib (100 nM). As expected, we found that erlotinib treatment decreased pERK, pAKT and pRelA (a marker of NF-kB signaling) and increased Parp cleavage (a marker of apoptosis) in parental HCC827 cells (Figure 3e). AXL siRNA treatment had no effect on these pathways in parental HCC827 cells (Figure 3e). Erlotinib treatment decreased pEGFR both in parental HCC827 cells and in the ER1 and ER2 sublines (Figure 3e). This observation is consistent with our finding that the ER sublines do not harbor a secondary resistance mutation in EGFR that would abrogate the ability of erlotinib to inhibit EGFR. In contrast, erlotinib treatment decreased pERK, pAKT and pRelA and increased the levels of cleaved Parp only upon AXL knockdown in the ER1 and ER2 cell lines (Figure 3e). Similar results were observed in HCC827 ER3, ER4 and ER5 sublines (Supplementary Figure 9). We next sought to validate our genetic findings using pharmacologic inhibitors of AXL. As expected, erlotinib decreased pEGFR, pERK, pAKT, pRelA and increased the levels of cleaved Parp in parental HCC827 cells irrespective of concurrent treatment with MP-470 or XL-880 (Figure 3f?g). In contrast, these effects of erlotinib treatment were observed only upon concurrent treatment with MP-470 (Figure 3f) or XL-880 (Figure 3g) in the HCC827 ER1 and ER2 cells. Similar results were observed in HCC827 ER3, ER4 and ER5 sublines treated with erlotinib and XL-880 either alone or in combination (Supplementary Figure 9). Together, the data suggest that AXL activation is necessary for acquired erlotinib resistance and that the MAPK, AKT and NF-kB pathways may, in part, mediate erlotinib resistance downstream of AXL in this system. To determine whether AXL is upregulated in the setting of erlotinib acquired resistance in cells other than HCC827, we used the same erlotinib treatment protocol to establish 2 isogenic, erlotinib-resistant sublines (IC 50> 1 \u00a5\u00ecM) derived from H3255 cells that express the EGFR L858R mutant commonly found in lung cancer patients and that are otherwise sensitive to erlotinib (IC 50 ~15nM). Similar to HCC827 cells, we found (1) overexpression of AXL in the absence of EGFR T790M, pEGFR and increased pMET, (2) overexpression of the EMT marker vimentin, and (3) that inhibition of AXL by siRNA, MP-470 or XL880 restored sensitivity to concurrent erlotinib treatment in the H3255 ER sublines (Supplementary Figure 10). Together, these data show that AXL upregulation promotes erlotinib acquired resistance in the setting of EMT in EGFR-mutant NSCLC tumor models and that combined inhibition of AXL and EGFR overcomes acquired resistance to erlotinib in these models. We next asked whether (1) forced expression of AXL is sufficient to induce erlotinib resistance and (2) whether AXL kinase activity is necessary for the induction of erlotinib resistance by AXL. To address these questions, we generated cDNA constructs that encode either wild type (WT) AXL or a kinase-impaired mutant of AXL in which a key conserved lysine within the kinase domain was changed to arginine (K567R). Transient overexpression of WT AXL, but not AXL KD (K567R), in HCC827 cells increased the levels of pAXL and the IC 50 for XL880 (Supplementary Figure 11, Figure 3h?i), suggesting that the K567R impairs AXL kinase function. Overexpression of WT AXL, but not kinase impaired AXL KD (K567R), induced resistance to erlotinib in HCC827 cells that was reversed upon treatment with XL-880 (1 \u00a5\u00ecM) (Figure 3h?i). In addition, we found that introduction of WT AXL was sufficient to induce partial resistance to erlotinib in PC9 cells that express an EGFR exon 19-deletion mutant and are otherwise erlotinib-sensitive (IC 50~25 nM) (Supplementary Figure 12). Together, the data indicate that AXL kinase activation is necessary and sufficient to promote erlotinib resistance in these EGFR mutant NSCLC models. To confirm that treatment with an AXL inhibitor restores erlotinib sensitivity via inhibition of AXL, and is not a consequence of an \u00a1\u00b0off-target\u00a1\u00b1 effect of drug treatment, we identified the \u00a1\u00b0gatekeeper\u00a1\u00b1 residue within the AXL kinase domain based by structural modeling of the co-crystal of MET bound to XL880 and of the location of the T790M gatekeeper residue in EGFR 20 , 21 (Supplementary Figure 13). The analysis indicated that an L620M mutation in AXL would be expected to result in steric clash with XL-880 and would block the ability of XL-880 to inhibit AXL. Thus we generated a cDNA encoding this gatekeeper mutant of AXL (L620M) and introduced it into HCC827 cells to determine if expression of it blocks the ability of XL-880 to restore erlotinib sensitivity in the setting of AXL overexpression. Expression of AXL L620M significantly increased the IC 50 for XL-880 (Supplementary Figure 11) and blocked the ability of XL880 to decrease pAXL in HCC827 cells (Figure 3i). In contrast to overexpression of WT AXL, we found that expression of AXL L620M abrogated the ability of XL-880 (1 \u00a5\u00ecM) to restore erlotinib sensitivity in HCC827 cells (Figure 3h?i). The data indicate that treatment with the AXL inhibitor XL880 restores erlotinib sensitivity by inhibiting AXL kinase activation in these EGFR mutant NSCLC models. AXL-mediated resistance may occur with an EMT. We observed an association between AXL overexpression and markers of EMT, including increased expression of vimentin, in several models of acquired erlotinib resistance. Recent data indicate that vimentin can promote EMT via epigenetic regulation of genes that are critical for EMT in breast cancer cells. 17 Thus we sought to determine whether vimentin overexpression was necessary for AXL overexpression and erlotinib resistance in HCC827 cells. We found that knockdown of vimentin by both pooled and 4 individual siRNAs decreased, but did not completely abolish, AXL expression (Figure 4a). Vimentin knockdown and concomitant downregulation of AXL enhanced erlotinib sensitivity in HCC827 ER3 cells (Figure 4b). Because vimentin has been shown to promote migration and adhesion in cells that have undergone an EMT 17 , 22, we examined whether HCC827 ER cells exhibited increased migration and adhesion. We found that HCC827 cells with acquired erlotinib resistance (ER3) exhibit increased migration and adhesion compared to parental HCC827 cells (Figure 4c?d). We also found that knockdown of vimentin, AXL, or treatment with XL880 inhibited migration and adhesion in HCC827 ER3 cells but had no effect in parental HCC827 cells (Figure 4c?d). Together, the data support a possible role for an EMT that is marked by vimentin overexpression in the development of acquired EGFR TKI resistance that is driven by AXL in this model of human EGFR mutant lung cancer. AXL is upregulated in patients with acquired resistance. Based on the preclinical data, we hypothesized that upregulation of AXL may promote acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. To test this hypothesis and to clinically validate our preclinical findings, we measured the expression of AXL by IHC (immunohistochemistry) in 35 matched EGFR-mutant NSCLC specimens obtained from patients both prior to treatment with the EGFR TKIs erlotinib or gefitinib and upon the development of EGFR TKI acquired resistance. In cases where enough material was available for additional studies, we also examined the specimens for GAS6 and vimentin (as a marker for EMT) expression by IHC (scoring system shown in Supplementary Figure 14), EGFR T790M by sequencing, and MET amplification by FISH. All patients in the cohort we analyzed had either an exon 19 deletion mutation or an exon 21 point mutation (L858R) in EGFR, were treated with either erlotinib or gefitinib and MET the established clinical definition of EGFR TKI acquired resistance (Table 2). 23 The clinical sample set that we analyzed harbored the full spectrum of major alterations known to occur in EGFR mutant lung cancer patients with acquired EGFR TKI resistance. 9 , 12 , 13 , 14 Indeed, we detected the EGFR T790M mutation in 8/28 (29%) and MET amplification in 6/31 (19%) of the resistant specimens examined (Tables 2?3 and Figure 5a, b). As compared to the pre-treatment specimen, we detected increased expression (an increase by 2+ or greater) of AXL in 7/35 (20%) and GAS6 in 7/28 (25%), and vimentin in 2/10 (20%) of the EGFR TKI resistant specimens evaluated (Tables 2?3 and Figure 5a?b). In 3 cases (#13,14,15) in which AXL was expressed at the same level in the baseline and matched resistance specimen we detected increased GAS6 specifically in the resistant specimen (Tables 2?3). This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that GAS6 overexpression may promote AXL activation in the setting of EGFR TKI acquired resistance in some cases. This hypothesis is supported by our preclinical data showing that knockdown of GAS6 can restore erlotinib sensitivity in some ER sublines that also overexpress AXL (Figure 3c). In order to provide independent validation of our IHC findings of increased expression of AXL and GAS6, we performed Q-RT-PCR on a small cohort of EGFR T790M mutation negative EGFR mutant lung cancer specimens with acquired EGFR TKI resistance compared to matched baseline specimens (n=5). Using stringent cut-offs (threshold >3 fold change in mRNA levels by Q RT PCR), we found increased AXL and GAS6 mRNA levels upon resistance in 20% and 60%, respectively, of these specimens (data not shown). We did not find increased AXL or GAS6 in the single specimen in which we detected increased MET expression (>3 fold change in mRNA by Q RT PCR) in this small cohort (data not shown). Our analysis of the clinical specimens indicates that some EGFR mutant NSCLCs with EGFR TKI acquired resistance can harbor multiple mechanisms of resistance. Consistent with prior studies, 13 we detected the EGFR T790M mutation in 50% of cases that also harbored MET amplification (Tables 2?3). Furthermore, we found co-occurrence of EGFR T790M and increased AXL and GAS6 in a minority of cases (Tables 2?3). In contrast, we did not detect MET amplification in any resistance specimen that had increased AXL or GAS6 expression (Tables 2?3). Coupled with the preclinical data, our findings suggest that activation of AXL and MET may be mutually exclusive mechanisms of acquired EGFR TKI resistance in NSCLCs. Discussion. We have identified activation of the AXL kinase as a novel mechanism of acquired EGFR TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs through an integrated analysis of human EGFR-mutant NSCLC tumor models and one of the largest clinical cohorts of paired EGFR-mutant NSCLC specimens from EGFR TKI treated patients reported to date. Our analysis of the clinical specimens shows that AXL upregulation is the second most common mechanism of EGFR TKI acquired resistance (after EGFR T790M) in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs that has been validated using primary human data. The frequency of EGFR T790M in the EGFR TKI resistant samples in this cohort is lower than previously reported. 9 , 12 , 13 , 14 Given that the sequencing assay we used to detect EGFR T790M is standard and validated, this likely represents either distinct biology of EGFR TKI resistance in the setting of AXL or GAS6 upregulation or that there may be greater variability in the frequency of EGFR T790M in EGFR TKI resistant lung cancers than previously described. Importantly, we found upregulation of AXL in patients that developed resistance to both EGFR TKIs (erlotinib and gefitinib) that are clinically approved for use in NSCLC patients worldwide. Our findings are thus relevant to the vast majority of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients treated with an EGFR TKI. The data suggest that activation of AXL can occur through its overexpression as well as through upregulation of its ligand GAS6 in the setting of EGFR TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. This observation is consistent with recent work showing that both upregulation of MET and its ligand HGF can promote EGFR TKI resistance in some EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. 10 Our data showing that in some ER cell lines GAS6 is not required for erlotinib resistance are consistent with earlier work demonstrating that AXL overexpression can promote downstream signaling and induce transformation in the absence of GAS6 expression. 24 Further work will be necessary to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which GAS6 might promote EGFR TKI resistance through activation of AXL and whether somatic alterations (amplifications, rearrangements, point mutations) in AXL or GAS6 occur in human EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. We found that in some cases AXL upregulation occurred in the context of an apparent EMT and that an EMT-associated transcriptional program involving upregulation of vimentin may, in part, drive AXL overexpression in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells with acquired EGFR TKI resistance. The data are consistent with prior studies in which vimentin upregulation was associated with AXL overexpression in breast cancer cells. 17 Although other mechanisms of AXL activation likely exist and will need to be investigated, our data are consistent with a model in which AXL may mediate acquired EGFR TKI resistance in the setting of an EMT in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. AXL-overexpressing HCC827 ER cells exhibited increased migration and adhesion, properties associated with EMT and the METastatic behavior of tumor cells. These findings in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells with erlotinib acquired resistance are consistent with prior work showing that overexpression of AXL is associated with increased METastasis and worse prognosis in several cancers. 15 Yet our studies uncover a distinct and specific role for AXL upregulation in acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. Our data therefore extend current knowledge of the role of AXL as a general prognostic biomarker in human cancer and demonstrate for the first time that AXL is a biomarker of acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy in NSCLC patients. Our observation that multiple mechanisms of resistance may contribute to EGFR TKI treatment resistance in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients is consistent with other recent studies. 13 , 14 Our data identifying AXL as a mechanism of EGFR TKI resistance enhance our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and the molecular mechanisms governing the evolution of resistance to molecularly targeted therapy in cancer patients. Further work will be necessary to determine the degree to which AXL activation may cooperate with other genetic and genomic alterations to induce resistance to EGFR inhibitors and other molecularly targeted therapies in lung and other cancers. Our data show that the kinase activity of AXL is required for erlotinib resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC tumor models. This observation provides strong rationale for the development and testing of AXL kinase inhibitors for clinical use in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients to either prevent or overcome EGFR TKI acquired resistance. The preclinical data also suggest that activation of multiple pathways including MAPK, AKT and NF-kB may promote EGFR TKI resistance downstream of AXL upregulation. This is consistent with prior work showing that AXL can drive the growth of cancer cells through activation of each of these pathways. 15 , 16 , 25 Further work will be necessary to determine which of these or other signaling pathways is most critical for AXL-driven EGFR TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. Such studies may identify additional points for therapeutic intervention in the setting of EGFR TKI acquired resistance driven by AXL in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. Based on our data, we propose that inhibition of AXL signaling may enhance responses to EGFR TKI treatment in appropriately selected EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. Online Methods. Cell lines and reagents. The human lung cancer cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection except for H3255, PC-9 cells which were generously provided by Susumu Kobayashi (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1\u00a1\u00bf Antibiotic/Antimycotic (Invitrogen) and were in the logarithmic growth phase at the initiation of all experiments. Erlotinib, XL880 (GSK1363089), PHA665752 and MP-470 were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (California, USA). Drugs were dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM and stored at ?20\u00a1\u00c6C. The final DMSO concentration in all experiments was <0.1% in medium. All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Boston, MA) except the anti-AXL and anti-phospho-AXL and anti-GAS6 antibodies, which were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Establishment of erlotinib-resistant subclones. Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of erlotinib every 3 weeks from 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on until 15 \u00a5\u00ecM over a 5 months period. Single-cell cloning was performed by the use of cloning cylinders and erlotinib-resistant subclones were successfully expanded with 10% fetal bovine serum culture medium containing 1 \u00a5\u00ecM erlotinib. The genetic identity of each subclone with the parental cells was verified by STR (short tandem repeat) analysis conducted at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD, USA) or the Korean Cell Line Bank (http://cellbank.snu.ac.kr) according to established protocols. Cell growth and viability assays. Cells were seeded at a density of 3000 cells/well in 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS overnight, then treated with respective agents for an additional 3 days. Viable cell numbers were determined using CellTiterGLO or MTS assay kit, as indicated in the Figure legends, according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Each assay consisted of 3 replicate wells and was repeated at least twice. Data were expressed as the percentage survival of control calculated from the absorbance, corrected for background. Western blot analysis. Cells were serum starved overnight and whole cell lysates were prepared using 10% TCA lysis or RIPA buffer and clarified by centrifugation. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Invitrogen) for Western blot analysis. After primary antibody incubation overnight, washing and incubation with secondary antibodies, blots were developed with a chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Gene expression profiling. Gene expression microarray profiling was performed in triplicate following RNA isolation from cells or xenograft tumors using the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions using either AffyMETrix U1333 2.0 plus arrays (ER1, ER2) and analyzed as described previously 27 ,25 or Illumina Human HT12- v3 arrays (ER3) and analyzed by Illumina BeadStudio Gene Expression Module v3.2. Bioinformatics analysis was performed and genes were filtered to include genes with differential expression based on setting a threshold of 3 fold change and a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold at 0.1 for the comparison of gene expression in the ER cell lines to the parental (vehicle treated) cells. Quantitative real time RT?PCR. For the validation of genes identified by gene expression profiling, quantitative real-time RT?PCR was performed on RNA isolated from NSCLC cells. Total RNA was collected from cultured cells using PureLink Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase with the use of oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen) and RT-PCR was performed by using LightCycler with Syber green probes (Roche) using the following variables: denaturation at 95\u00a1\u00c6C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of amplification(95\u00a1\u00c6C 10 s, 60\u00a1\u00c6C 10 s, and 72\u00a1\u00c6C 15 s), and cooling to 40\u00a1\u00c6C at a transition rate of 20\u00a1\u00c6C/s. Levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or actin expression were used as internal reference to normalize input cDNA. Ratios of level of each gene to as compared to reference standard were then calculated. Sequences for the primers used for AXL and GAS6 Q RT-PCR are shown in Supplementary Table 4. Primers and probes used for EGFR and MET sequencing and FISH, respectively, were as previously published. 13 , 28 siRNA knockdown. Knockdown of AXL, MET and vimentin was performed using specific single or pooled siRNAs, as indicated, targeting the indicated genes purchased from Dharmacon RNAi Technologies (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). SiGENOME non-targeting siRNAs served as negative controls. Introduction of siRNA was performed with DharmaFect1 reagent according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Efficiency of knockdown at different times or dose points was assessed by Q RT PCR or western blotting on cell lysates. AXL cDNA and overexpression studies. The AXL gene with an HA tag at the C-terminus was amplified by overlapping PCR using cDNA generated from ER3 cells and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (+) vector. Amino acid changes (K567R or L620M) were introduced using the Strategene QuickChange Mutagenesis Kit, according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol. The accuracy of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were transfected with the AXL-expressing vectors or empty vector as a control by using FuGENE HD reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Stable HCC827 subclones resistant to the selection antibiotic, 500\u00a5\u00ecg/ml G418 were generated 24 hours post-transfection. Empty-vector expressing HCC827 cells were generated as a control. AXL protein expression was detected by using anti-HA probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Migration and adhesion studies. 180,000 cells were plated onto 3.5 cm cell culture dishes. At 30 minutes, the dishes were washed and cells were fixed and stained for counting. Average cell numbers of 5 random 100\u00a1\u00bf fields under light microscope are presented with \u00a1\u00be SEM. Migration: 10,000 cells in 200 \u00a5\u00ecl medium without FBS were placed in the upper chamber of transwells(6.5 mm diameter, 8 \u00a5\u00ecm pore size polycarbonate membrane, Corning), and the lower chamber filled with 1 ml of medium with 10% FBS supplemented with or without the indicated drug treatments. After incubation for 16 hours, non-migrating cells were removed with cotton swabs, and the cells that migrated into the lower surface of the filters were stained with crystal violet. Cells were counted under a microscope, and triplicate results are expressed as means \u00a1\u00be SEM. shRNA knockdown. For the shRNA experiments each retroviral and lentiviral shRNA was packaged in 293FT cells according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Indicated cell lines were spin infected with 1 ug/ml polybrene and 48h after infection were selected with 2 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml of puromycin for 48h. Target gene expression was measured by either Q RT PCR or western blot 48?72h later. Tumorigenesis assays. Human lung cancer cells (as indicated) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of CB17 SCID mice (Taconic). Tumor-bearing mice (tumor size 200?500 mm 3) were randomized to treatment with vehicle (DMSO/CMC) or erlotinib HCL 12.5 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally. Tumor measurements were made on days indicated and expressed as described in the Figure legends. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Research Animal Resource Center of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Combination index (CI) analysis. The combination effects were evaluated with the MTT assay at a 1:1 ratio (erlotinib (\u00a5\u00ecM):XL880 (\u00a5\u00ecM) and erlotinib (\u00a5\u00ecM):PHA665752 (\u00a5\u00ecM)) in HCC827ER cells. The fraction affected (Fa) (i.e., Fa of 0.25 is equivalent to 75% viable cells) and CI values processed using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).CI values of less than 1, 1, and greater than 1 were taken as synergism, additive effect, and antagonism, respectively. Immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg protein from total lysates was mixed with 1 \u00a5\u00ecg of anti-AXL (Santa Cruz, CA), and incubated on ice for 2 h. Protein G Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) was added to the mixture and incubated overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6. Immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min, washed twice with lysis buffer, and resuspended in 70 \u00a5\u00ecl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Subsequently, immune complexes were probed with anti-AXL and phosphotyrosine antibodies(Santa Cruz, CA). Sequencing of AXL, EGFR, K-Ras and B-Raf. Sequencing of full length of AXL and EGFR was performed by standard Methods using the primer sequences listed Supplementary Table 5. Sequencing of exon 2 of K-Ras and exons 11 and 15 of BRAF was performed on genomic DNA using validated primers and protocols. 13 IHC on NSCLC clinical specimens. All specimens were acquired from patients under the auspices of IRB-approved clinical protocols at each hospital in which informed consent was obtained and were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour tissues (FFPE), that were examined to ensure >75% tumor infiltration, and stained with haematoxilin/eosin and assessed by a thoracic pathologist at MSKCC (New York, NY, USA), As an Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea), USP Dexeus University Institute (Barcelona, Spain). IHC was performed in the Core Research IHC Laboratory at each institution on FFPE sections, as previously described 29, using the indicated antibodies: Human AXL antigen - affinity-purified polyclonal antibody, R&D systems, catalog #AF154AXL ; Human GAS6 - affinity-purified polyclonal antibody, R&D systems, catalog #AB885, Human vimentin - affinity-purified polyclonal antibody, Cell Signaling Technologies, catalog #3932. Expression was examined by standard immunohistochemistry using 4um thick sections of matched, paired specimens. Deparaffinized tissue sections were stained following the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol at a dilution of 1:500 on a Ventana Dixcovery XT automated stainer. EGFR T790M mutation and MET amplification were analyzed using previously described sequencing and FISH protocols, 13 respectively, and vimentin expression by IHC using established MET hods and clinical scoring criteria. 26 Supplementary Material. 1. 2. 3. 4.

                "text": "N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase inhibits p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and coordinates with p53 to determine sensitivity to alkylating agents\tAlkylating agents induce genome-wide base damage, which is repaired mainly by N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG). An elevated expression of MPG in certain types of tumor cells confers higher sensitivity to alkylation agents because MPG-induced apurinic/apyrimidic (AP) sites trigger more strand breaks. However, the determinant of drug sensitivity or insensitivity still remains unclear. Here, we report that the p53 status coordinates with MPG to play a pivotal role in such process. MPG expression is positive in breast, lung and colon cancers (38.7%, 43.4% and 25.3%, respectively) but negative in all adjacent normal tissues. MPG directly binds to the tumor suppressor p53 and represses p53 activity in unstressed cells. The overexpression of MPG reduced, whereas depletion of MPG increased, the expression levels of pro-arrest gene downstream of p53 including p21, 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 and Gadd45 but not proapoptotic ones. The N-terminal region of MPG was specifically required for the interaction with the DNA binding domain of p53. Upon DNA alkylation stress, in p53 wild-type tumor cells, p53 dissociated from MPG and induced cell growth arrest. Then, AP sites were repaired efficiently, which led to insensitivity to alkylating agents. By contrast, in p53-mutated cells, the AP sites were repaired with low efficacy. To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence to show that a DNA repair enzyme functions as a selective regulator of p53, and these findings provide new insights into the functional linkage between MPG and p53 in cancer therapy. Introduction. Living cells continually suffer damage as a consequence of normal cellular metabolism and as a result of attacks by environmental agents. Thus, the cell is continually faced with an agonizing choice: repair and live or die. Defects in this decision process can lead to cancer. The tumor suppressor p53 acts as a \u00a1\u00b0traffic cop\u00a1\u00b1 to decide cell fate 1. It is widely accepted that p53 is a sequence-specific transcription factor and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell cycle progression, apoptosis and DNA repair in response to diverse stress signals 2,3. In unstressed conditions, p53 is kept at an extremely low level due to rapid proteasomal degradation. However, under stress conditions p53 is stabilized and released from suppression 4. There are at least two ways in which p53 is activated: posttranslational modifications and interactions with various proteins. A few proteins have been identified that associate with p53 to selectively regulate the expression of p53 downstream targets. For example, we recently found that ATM- and p53-associated KNZF protein (Apak), a KRAB-type zinc finger protein, interacts with p53 directly and specifically inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis 5. Similarly, ASPP1/2 and hCAS have been shown to interact with p53 and specifically enhance p53-induced apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest 6,7. In contrast, Hzf binds to p53, and preferentially transactivates the pro-arrest p53 target genes 8. Notably, Hzf itself is a downstream target gene of p53. When DNA damage occurs, Hzf is upregulated and then coordinates with p53 to induce the expression of cell cycle arrest genes 8. In unstressed conditions, the regulation of p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, particularly the negative regulation, is still not fully understood. To search for novel regulators of p53, we used high-density protein microarrays, as described previously 9. Among the novel potential p53-interacting proteins, we found that N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG, also called AAG or ANPG), the first identified enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway 10, can bind to p53 and selectively inhibit p53-mediated cell cycle arrest in cancer cells under normal physiological situations. BER is the major DNA-repair process responsible for handling the DNA damage that is induced by exogenous and endogenous alkylating and oxidative agents and by spontaneous depurinations. As a core enzyme in BER, MPG has been shown to recognize and excise a broad range of modified bases, in addition to normal bases, in DNA. The removal of bases leaves repair intermediates, abasic (apurinic/apyrimidic, AP) sites, that are cytotoxic and mutagenic, which makes it apparent that the removal of these BER intermediates is crucial 11,12. Under certain conditions, an elevated expression of MPG was found to contribute to the formation of sister chromatid exchanges, chromosomal aberrations, frameshift mutagenesis and microsatellite instability 13,14,15. Previous analysis showed that MPG expression was increased in certain human cancers including breast cancer cells. Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory disease associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer 16, was also observed to be associated with an increased level and activity of MPG 17. Alkylating agents have been frequently used in the treatment of human cancers. Cancer cells can become resistant to the treatments, and high-dose chemotherapy may induce secondary cancers. The major DNA damage produced by alkylating agents is recognized and repaired by MPG; therefore, it is a good candidate molecular target for individualized therapy. It has been reported that reducing the levels of MPG protein using siRNA increased the sensitivity of cervical carcinoma cell lines to Temozolomide (TMZ), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNNG) and 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) 18. Reciprocally, overexpression of MPG was also deleterious to cells because more alkylating agent-induced AP sites and single- or double-stranded DNA breaks were produced 11,12. Collectively the above data suggest that an important role for MPG in carcinogenesis and that cancer therapy depends on its glycosylase activity to produce AP sites. Moreover, the varied responses of different cell types suggest that there are other molecules participating in the cellular response. The crystal structure of the MPG-DNA complex shows that Tyr162 of the enzyme is intercalated into the space vacated by the lesion via the DNA minor groove, which helps maintaining proper base stacking and minimizing DNA distortion. Glu125 acts as a general base, deprotonating a water molecule in the nucleophilic attack on the N-glycosylic bond by an acid-base catalytic mechanism 19,20. To date, the function of the N-terminal part of MPG (aa 1-80) remains unclear. Our current findings show that the MPG N-terminus is both sufficient and necessary for p53 binding and regulation. MPG specifically inhibits p53-mediated cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis. In response to alkylation damage, in p53 wild-type tumor cells, MPG dissociated from p53, resulting in the release of p53 and cell cycle arrest to allow for the repair of damaged bases. Thus, the combination of high levels of MPG with wild-type p53 in certain tumor cells led to insensitivity to alkylating agents. By contrast, in p53-mutated cells, the AP sites were repaired with low efficacy and the killing effects were higher than in the p53 wild-type cells. Therefore, MPG coordinates its glycosylase and non-glycosylase modules to participate in the DNA damage repair. Also, the p53 status coordinates with MPG to play a pivotal role in the determination of cancer sensitivity to alkylating drugs. To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence to show that a DNA repair enzyme functions as a selective regulator of p53, and these findings provide new insights into the functional linkage between MPG and p53 in cancer therapy. Results. MPG interacts with p53 in vitro and in vivo. To find new modulators of p53, we used a ProtoArray\u00a2\u00e7 Human Protein Microarray spotted with 8000 GST-tagged human proteins from multiple gene families on high-density glass slides (Invitrogen). All proteins were purified under nondenaturing conditions and printed at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C to preserve their native structures and functions. Protein arrays (n = 3 per experimental group) were incubated with recombinant active p53 or assay buffer only. Software analysis was performed to evaluate the significant differences in the signal intensity between control arrays and the arrays incubated with p53. A total of 28 potential p53-interacting proteins were identified, including casein kinase 1 and aurora kinase A, the known p53-binding proteins (Table 1). Among the previously unidentified potential p53-interactors is MPG, which has been demonstrated to be involved in the BER pathway and was further investigated in this study. As the above assay represents an in vitro binding method, we next tested whether MPG interacts with p53 in cultured mammalian cells. Myc-tagged MPG and Flag-tagged p53 were expressed individually or together in p53-null H1299 cells followed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays. Indeed, MPG was co-immunoprecipitated with ectopic p53 (Figure 1A). Reciprocal assays showed that p53 was also co-immunoprecipitated with the ectopic MPG protein (Figure 1B). For negative controls, there was no p53 or MPG detected in anti-Myc or anti-Flag antibody immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with Myc-MPG or Flag-p53 alone, respectively (Figure 1A and ?and1B).1B). To further confirm the interaction between MPG and p53, an in vitro GST pull-down assay was performed. As shown, GST-fused MPG, but not GST alone, could pull down Myc-p53 that was overexpressed in H1299 cells (Figure 1C). Similarly, GST-p53 could also pull down the Myc-MPG protein expressed in H1299 (Figure 1D). Importantly, endogenous MPG was easily co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous p53, but not by a control IgG in wild-type p53-expressing MCF7 breast cancer cells (Figure 1E) and in HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). Indirect immunofluorescence assays revealed that MPG and p53 were colocalized predominantly in the nucleoplasm of MCF7 cells (Figure 1F). These results indicate that p53 binds to MPG both in vitro and in cultured cells. Determination of the mutual interaction regions in p53 and MPG. To reveal the molecular mechanism for the interaction of MPG and p53, we used various p53 and MPG deletion mutants to map the domains required for their interaction. As a well-defined transcription factor, p53 consists of an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD), a central DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal regulatory domain (including an oligomerization domain and a basic domain) (Figure 2A). Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that deletion of the N-terminal TAD domain of p53 (ND2, aa 113-393) or the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53 (CD1, aa 1-290) had no effects on the interaction between p53 and MPG (Figure 2B, lanes 1, 2 and 5). By contrast, deletion of the p53 central DBD (MD1, aa 1-113/290-393) abolished the binding (Figure 2B, lane 3). Furthermore, a careful examination of the DBD showed that the C-terminal part of the DBD (aa 237-290) was critical for the interaction (Figure 2B, lanes 4 and 6). To confirm this result, we performed an in vitro GST pull-down assay. GST-fused MPG, but not GST alone, could pull down the ND2, MD3 and CD1 mutants of p53 and wild-type p53 but not the MD1 and CD2 mutants overexpressed in H1299 cells (Figure 2C). These results indicate that the region around aa 237-290 within the p53 DNA binding domain is critical for the MPG interaction. Similarly, a series of MPG deletion mutants was generated (Figure 2D) and tested for the interaction with p53 through Co-IP (Figure 2E) and GST pull-down assays (Figure 2F). As shown, all of the examined MPG mutants, with the exception of \u00a5\u00c4N2 (aa 94-294) and \u00a5\u00c4N3 (aa 166-294), interacted with p53 in both assays (Figure 2E and ?and2F).2F). These results suggest that the N-terminal aa 34-79 region of MPG is both sufficient and necessary for p53 binding. Certain residues within the DNA binding domain of p53 play a key role in the MPG-p53 interaction. Given the fact that MPG binds to the DNA binding domain of p53, which represents the hot mutation region in human tumors, we next explored whether tumor-derived p53 mutations in the DBD had any effect on the interaction between MPG and p53. A total of six frequently observed mutations of this region, including R248Q, R273C, R273H, A266E, R280K and E285K, were examined. It has been reported that all of these mutants have either low or no transactivation function compared with wild-type p53 21,22. The generated p53 mutants were first confirmed for their transcriptional activity through a pG13L luciferase reporter assay. As expected, all mutants had low (e.g., A266E and E285K) or almost no transcriptional activity (especially R248Q, R273C, R273H and R280K) on the pG13L reporter compared with wild-type p53 (Figure 3A), consistent with previous reports 23. These mutants were then tested for the interaction with MPG through Co-IP assays. Strikingly, three of the four loss-of-function mutants (i.e., R248Q, R273C and R280K) dramatically lost the ability to interact with MPG (Figure 3B, lanes 3, 5 and 7). By contrast, the A266E and E285K mutants possessed a comparable MPG-binding ability with wild-type p53 (lanes 4 and 8). Reduced but still significant binding occurred with the R273H mutant for an unknown reason (lane 6). The results indicate that R248, R273 and R280 of p53 are key residues for the interaction with MPG. To further verify these results, we selected several tumor cell lines possessing the above p53 mutations to examine the possible endogenous MPG-p53 interaction, including leukemia MOLT4 (R248Q), human colon cancer (CC) HT29 (R273H), human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 (R280K), human breast cancer BT474 (E285K) and leukemia Jurkat (T256K, D259G, S260A) cell lines. Co-IP assays showed that endogenous R248Q (MOLT-4) and R280K (MB-231) had very weak interaction with MPG, whereas R273H (HT29) and E285K (BT474) had a similar MPG binding affinity compared with wild-type p53 (MCF7) (Figure 3C), consistent with the exogenous Co-IP assay results (Figure 3B). Interestingly, the T256K, D259G and S260A mutations in Jurkat cells also attenuated the interaction with MPG (Figure 3C). These data indicate that certain residues within the p53 DBD (including R248, T256, D259, S260, R273 and R280) play critical roles in mediating the interaction with MPG, and some of the pathophysiologically occurring mutations in human tumors significantly weaken this interaction. MPG represses p53-dependent transcriptional activity. Like other molecules in the DNA repair system, MPG cooperates with MBD1 for transcriptional repression 24. To check whether MPG modulates the transcriptional activity of p53 by binding to p53, we expressed Myc-MPG with a luciferase reporter plasmid pG13L that contains 13 tandem repeats of the p53 responsive element in p53 wild-type MCF7 cells. MPG significantly inhibited the activity of endogenous p53 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A). Knockdown of endogenous MPG by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly enhanced p53 activity in MCF7 cells (Figure 4B) and in HEK293 cells (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). To confirm the results, exogenous p53 was expressed in p53-null H1299 and HCT116 p53 ?/? cells together with pG13L and MPG. In the absence of exogenous p53, pG13L could not be activated; however, in the presence of exogenous p53, pG13L could be activated. The co-expression of MPG could inhibit p53 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C and ?and4D).4D). Given that the N-terminal aa 35-79 of MPG are required for p53 binding (Figure 2), we determined whether they are also important for the repressive activity. As shown in Figure 4E, a deletion of the p53-binding region in MPG removed the inhibitory effect of MPG on p53 activity, suggesting that their interaction is required for MPG to inhibit p53. The MPG truncation that lacks residues 1-79 contains the same enzymatic activity and binding specificity as the full-length protein 19. This implies that MPG represses p53 activity independently of the MPG glycosylase activity. To confirm this hypothesis, two point-mutation mutants of MPG, E125A and Y162A, were constructed. These two mutants have minimal glycosylase activity 25. A p53-dependent reporter with wild-type MPG, E125A, Y162A and p53 were co-transfected into H1299 cells. Wild-type MPG, E125A and Y162A had the same ability to significantly repress the transcriptional activity of exogenous p53 (Figure 4F). These results support that MPG can efficiently repress p53 transcriptional activity independently of its enzymatic activity. We also tested whether p53 had any effects on the glycosylase activity of MPG. Biotin-labeled hypoxanthine-containing oligos were incubated with purified MPG with or without p53 protein (Supplementary information, Data S1). As shown in Supplementary information, Figure S2, p53 had no significant effect on MPG excision activity. MPG selectively inhibits p53 binding to pro-arrest target genes. To evaluate the effect of MPG on the transactivation function of p53, we first measured the DNA-binding activity of p53 to its downstream targets by electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs). We transfected a mock vector, MPG or p53 alone, or co-transfected p53 with different doses of MPG in H1299 cells and then harvested the nuclear extracts after 48 h. In the reaction buffer, Mg 2+ was added to inhibit non-specific binding of MPG 26. As shown in Figure 5A, MPG reduced the DNA-binding activity of p53 to its binding sites on p21, 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 and Gadd45 to an almost undetectable level in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, MPG had no significant effects on p53 binding to PUMA. For the controls, the vector and MPG alone produced no complexes with these oligonucleotides. These results suggest that MPG inhibits the DNA-binding ability of p53. Because the short probes of the examined p53 targets possess a highly conserved p53-binding consensus sequence, we propose that the preferential inhibition on the pro-arrest genes but not on pro-apoptotic PUMA by MPG might not be caused by the differences among the DNA sequences. Given that the protein used in the EMSA assays was isolated from the nuclear extracts of mammalian cells, MPG and its interacting proteins might play a role in the selection. To further verify the differential effects of MPG on p53 binding to the targets, quantitative Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays by real-time PCR were carried out using control IgG or p53 antibody. Co-expression of MPG reduced occupancy of p53 at the promoters of p21, 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 and the third intron of Gadd45, but it had no significant effect on the promoters of PUMA or PIG3 (Figure 5B). As a control, MPG itself could not be co-immunoprecipitated with these target genes. These data argue for a model in which MPG binds to p53 and selectively interferes with its binding to cell cycle arrest targets such as p21, 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 and Gadd45. MPG negatively regulates p53-mediated cell cycle arrest. We next examined the ability of MPG to regulate the transcription of p53 target genes. We measured the mRNA levels of typical target genes of p53 using quantitative real-time RT-PCR in the presence of overexpressed MPG or knockdown of endogenous MPG in MCF7 cells. The overexpression of MPG significantly reduced the mRNA levels of pro-arrest genes, including p21, 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 and Gadd45 but had only weak effects on the pro-apoptotic genes PUMA, Noxa and PIG3; the DNA repair gene p53R2; and the metabolism gene TIGAR (Figure 6A). Consistently, when MPG was knocked down, the mRNA levels of p21, 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 and Gadd45 were increased; in contrast, PUMA, Noxa, PIG3, p53R2 and TIGAR showed little change (Figure 6B). Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells (Supplementary information, Figure S3). The regulatory effect of MPG on the cell cycle arrest genes was dependent on p53, as in the p53-depleted MCF7 cells; MPG depletion had no significant effect on the expression levels of these genes (Figure 6C). To confirm these results, we analyzed the expression of p53 target genes by western blotting. Overexpression of MPG downregulated the expression levels of p21, Gadd45 and 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2, but not those of PUMA, Noxa, PIG3, TIGAR or p53 itself (Figure 6D). When MPG was depleted by RNAi, the protein levels of p21, Gadd45 and 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 were upregulated, while those of PUMA, Noxa, PIG3, TIGAR and p53 remained unchanged (Figure 6E). To examine whether MPG influences p53-mediated cellular effects, we measured cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The knockdown of MPG induced a prominent G1 arrest in p53-proficient MCF7 cells but not in p53-depleted MCF7 cells (Figure 6F). In contrast, reducing the lower level of MPG had no significant effect on apoptosis (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that MPG negatively regulates p53-dependent cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis. MPG releases p53 under alkylating agent-induced DNA damage. To explore how MPG balances the functions of glycosylase and p53 negative modulation in greater detail, we chose 3 different chemotherapeutic agents, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), TMZ and MMS. 5-FU can block DNA synthesis while TMZ and MMS are known to induce genome-wide base damage, including 7- mG and 3- mA, which are the major substrates for MPG in vivo 27,28. Western blot analysis revealed that knockdown of MPG upregulated p21 and 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2, but not p53, in MCF7 cells (Figure 7A, lanes 1 and 2). Following an exposure to 5-FU for 4 h, the effects of MPG depletion on p21 and 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 were not changed (Figure 7A, lanes 3 and 4). By contrast, TMZ and MMS treatment induced p21 and 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 expression, and MPG depletion had no further effects on the increase (Figure 7A, lanes 5-8), implying that MPG lost the ability to regulate p53 activity under TMZ and MMS treatment. Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 was used to verify the activating effect of each drug. Indeed, upon treatment with TMZ or MMS, but not 5-FU, the exogenous expression of MPG failed to inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53 in MCF7 cells (Figure 7B). Because the MPG repression of p53 is dependent on their interaction, we then examined the endogenous interaction between p53 and MPG after DNA damage. Four hours after TMZ or MMS treatment, the interaction between MPG and p53 was significantly attenuated; treatment with 5-FU had no such effect (Figure 7C). The above results suggest that MPG had decreased ability to modulate p53 upon DNA damage induced specifically by alkylating agents. MTS assay was used to measure cellular survival following MMS exposure. Cell survival measured by the MTS assay includes not only actively proliferating cells but also all metabolically active cells and is based on the assumption that dead cells do not reduce tetrazolium 29. MCF7 cells were transfected with MPG or co-transfected with p53 or p53 mutant R248Q (which cannot bind to MPG with high affinity as shown in Figure 3) and MPG. MTS assays were carried out 24 h after MMS exposure. Results of > 10 independent experiments showed that MPG- but not p53-overexpressing cells were significantly more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of MMS (Figure 7D). Co-expression of p53 with MPG reversed the effect of MPG, leading to enhanced cell survival. By contrast, the p53 mutant, which cannot efficiently bind to MPG had no such rescue effect (Figure 7D). The fact that MPG lost its ability to negatively modulate p53 upon exposure to alkylating agents prompted us to speculate that MPG may be involved in tumorigenesis or be potentially beneficial in tumor therapy. We then examined the expression of MPG and p53 proteins in human cancer samples. Immunohistochemical staining of paired breast ductal carcinoma (BDC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and CC) samples was performed (Figure 7E). Analysis of the stained tissue samples showed that the expression of MPG was positive in 38.7% of BDC, 43.4% of LSCC and 25.3% of CC cases and negative in all adjacent normal tissues. The percentages of the cases expressing a high MPG but low p53 (wild type) are 19.4% (BDC), 17.0% (LSCC) and 12% (CC) (Table 2). These results suggest a possible role of MPG overexpression in the development of human cancers. Collectively, the above findings provide new insights into the functional linkage between MPG and p53 in cancer therapy. Functional relevance of MPG-p53 interaction in BER. To demonstrate the physiological relevance of MPG as a p53 negative modulator in regulating BER, MCF7 cells were transfected with MPG or co-transfected with p53 and MPG. After an exposure to MMS, the unrepaired intermediates of BER were assessed by the accumulation of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs). We used an NAD(P)H depletion assay to measure the extent of SSBs 30,31. Accumulation of SSBs activates poly(ADPribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) that catalyzes the formation of polymers of poly(ADP-ribose), resulting in NAD + depletion. As seen in Figure 8A, SSBs were provoked after the cells were exposed to MMS, and the breaks were more produced when MPG, but not p53, was overexpressed. When MPG and p53 were co-expressed, the BER activity associated with SSB repair was restored only by wild-type p53 but not p53-R248Q mutant (Figure 8A). These results suggest that p53 activity on pro-arrest target genes and cell cycle arrest can modulate BER capacity. To confirm these results, the single cell gel electrophoresis or comet assay was performed 29,32,33. The alkaline comet indicates an increase of alkaline labile sites (AP sites or SSBs). Cells were assayed 4 h after treatment with MMS of different concentrations. Alkaline comet assay results showed significantly increased comet tails in the Myc-MPG group treated with MMS compared with vector control, indicating that cells produce AP sites and SSBs in response to MMS treatment, and that MPG overexpression resulted in more sensitivity to alkylating agent. When wild-type p53 and MPG were co-expressed, comet tails was shorter than MPG alone. By contrast, the p53-R248Q mutant had no such effect (Figure 8B and ?and8C8C). As a support, the number of AP sites in MMS-treated cells was measured using the ARP assay 34,35. As predicted, more AP sites were detected in those cells where MPG was overexpressed alone than in the cells where MPG and wild-type p53 were co-expressed (Figure 8D). This is consistent with the suggestion that upon DNA alkylation stress, wild-type p53 dissociates from MPG and induces cell growth arrest. Then, AP sites are repaired efficiently, which leads to insensitivity to alkylating agents. By contrast, p53 mutants which have no transcriptional activity cannot induce cell cycle arrest and thus the AP sites are repaired with low efficacy. Discussion. MPG is a critical glycosylase involved in the BER pathway to prevent alkylation-induced chromosome damage and cytotoxicity 36. The N-terminal tail of MPG contributes little to MPG's recognition of substrates or N-glycosylase activity 19,20,37. In the present study, we report that the N-terminal aa 34-79 of MPG plays a role in binding to p53 and inhibiting p53 activity. MPG regulates p53 transcriptional activity in a catalytic activity-independent manner. As far as we know, this is the first evidence to clearly show a glycosylase-independent function of MPG. Thus, we propose a model that the N-terminal part of MPG mediates its p53-regulating function while the rest of MPG executes the glycosylase activity, and both actions coordinate to control the genomic stability. Mapping analysis revealed that the aa 236-290 region within the DBD of p53 was critical for its interaction with MPG. More than 90% of p53 native mutations in human tumors were detected in this domain. Interestingly, three out of four loss-of-function mutants (i.e., R248Q, R273C and R280K) dramatically reduced the ability to interact with MPG (Figure 3). Mutations of p53 result in loss of the normal tumor suppressor function (LOF) but gain-of-function (GOF) of oncogene at the same time 38. Whether the mechanisms also involve MPG is an important avenue for future studies. The DBDis important for p53 to recognize the consensus sequence in target genes and transactivate the downstream genes to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Therefore, we measured the DNA-binding activity of p53 in the presence of MPG. In unstressed cells, the ability of exogenous p53 to bind to cell cycle control genes, such as p21, 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 and Gadd45, was abolished by MPG in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, there were no significant changes for pro-apoptotic genes. Moreover, the mRNA and protein levels of p21, 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 and Gadd45 were regulated by MPG overexpression or knockdown and such regulation was dependent on the presence of p53. Indeed, in MCF7 cells that contain wild-type p53, reducing the level of MPG induced G1 arrest without a significant induction of apoptosis. Notably, MPG binds to p53 with a strong affinity as the endogenous interaction between MPG and p53 was easily detected by Co-IP assays. Therefore, we propose that MPG acts was a constitutive regulator of p53 in unstressed cells to control cell cycle arrest. In contrast to the functional mode of MPG, Hzf (another selective pro-arrest regulator of p53) is induced by p53 and then helps p53 to control the cell cycle arrest 8. MPG expression seems to be independent of the p53 status and cannot be induced by p53 or DNA damage. This prompts the following question: why does MPG preferentially regulate the pro-arrest p53 target genes over the pro-apoptotic genes? We speculate that there may be three mechanisms by which interacting proteins coordinate with p53 to modulate downstream outcomes: (1) by regulating p53 protein levels, as low levels of p53 tend to associate with growth-arrest genes while higher levels favor pro-apoptotic genes and trigger apoptosis; (2) proteins that are transcription factors themselves can bind to promoter sites adjacent to p53 response elements in addition to binding to the p53 protein to selectively induce specific response genes; and (3) proteins bind to p53 and directly influence the ability of p53 itself to bind preferentially to particular DNA target sequences. We observed that MPG and p53 cannot mutually modulate each other's protein levels. Moreover, MPG itself cannot bind to p53 response elements directly. Our data strongly suggest that upon MPG binding to p53, p53 is preferentially inhibited from being recruited to the promoters of its cell cycle-arrest target genes, although the detailed selective mechanism is still unclear. We hypothesize that perhaps other unidentified co-factors in the complex with MPG help to confer the modulator function of MPG. We are currently exploring the components of the MPG complex using an immunoprecipitation assay combined with mass spectrometry analysis. Cells are continuously exposed to damaging stimuli from normal cellular metabolism and environmental agents. BER is the major DNA repair pathway in mammalian cells for eliminating small DNA base lesions. The approximate 10 4 damaging events/mammalian cell that happen every day underscore the importance of BER. MPG can recognize and excise the damaged base resulting in a baseless or abasic or apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site. Unrepaired AP sites block DNA replication and transcription. Previous studies indicated that overexpression of MPG dramatically sensitized cells to alkylating agent-induced cytotoxicity by an increased production of AP sites (toxic repair intermediates) and strand breaks 12 and disrupted the normal BER. A recent study revealed that an inappropriate expression of human MPG can increase the accumulation of BER intermediates that promotes genomic instability 39. MPG can specifically bind to DNA containing one and two base-pair loops within repetitive sequences, and the strength of this binding correlates with the extent of frameshift mutagenesis and microsatellite instability. In our study, we showed that increased MPG levels inhibit the ability of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest and shorten the DNA repair process, resulting in a reduction of BER and an accumulation of cytotoxic AP sites. It can be envisioned that MPG is kept at a low level in normal cells to avoid the accumulation of toxic repair intermediates and to maintain genomic stability. MPG overexpression may lead to a pronounced production of AP sites and an inhibition of cell cycle arrest induced by p53, both of which may contribute to overwhelming the downstream rate-limiting step of BER. The unbalanced repair may then contribute to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Another question is whether MPG plays a key role in reducing the p53-mediated cell cycle arrest in response to different types of genotoxic stress. An S phase-specific antimetabolite, 5-FU, interrupts thymidylate synthase and blocks the synthesis of the pyrimidine thymidine, which is a nucleotide required for DNA replication 40. Cytotoxicity of MMS and TMZ caused by the alkylation of DNA is strongly attenuated by the ability of MPG to repair DNA lesions. When MPG is knocked down under such conditions, p21 and 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 were not upregulated just after treatment with TMZ and MMS. Meanwhile, MPG lost the ability to bind and repress p53 transactivity (Figure 7). One possible explanation is that MPG dissociated from p53 and distributed widely over the genome to remove the damaged DNA caused by the alkylation agents. Interestingly, we observed that MPG overexpression occurs in breast ductal carcinoma, LSCC and CC samples (Figure 7); this is consistent with the low expression of p53 (which might be wild type due to the rapid dynamic degradation) in these cancer patients. Alkylating agents are clinically used in the treatment of several human cancers. The cytotoxicity of these anticancer drugs results from the alkylation of DNA and is strongly attenuated by the ability of the cells to repair DNA lesions. Besides being cytotoxic, these agents are also mutagenic and the occurrence of secondary cancers has been linked to the use of high-dose chemotherapeutic regimens. For those patients with high levels of MPG and wild-type p53, alkylating agents may increase the risk of secondary cancers or have diminished therapeutic effects. The pathophysiological relevance of MPG and p53 in cancers needs deeper investigation in the future. In summary, this study shows that MPG, an important glycosylase in the BER pathway, specifically inhibits p53-mediated cell cycle arrest in a glycosylase-independent manner. The status of p53 coordinates with MPG to determine the sensitivity to alkylating drugs in cancer therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence to show that a DNA repair enzyme functions as a selective regulator of p53. Materials and Methods. Plasmid constructs. Full-length, truncated, and point mutations of MPG and point mutations of p53 were constructed by inserting PCR amplified fragments into the related vectors. Detailed construct information of MPG was previously described 41. A series of p53-truncated plasmids were gifts from Dr Shengcai Lin and described previously 41,42. Flag-p53 and Myc-p53 were a kind gift from Dr Yue Xiong, and pG13-Luc p53 luciferase construct was obtained from Dr. Bert Vogelstein. Cell culture and transfection. Human breast cancer MCF7 cells, BT474 cells, and MDA-MB-231 cells, human CC HCT116 cells (a kind gift from Dr Qimin Zhan) and human lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Hyclone) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone). Human leukemia MOLT-4 cells and Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone) with 10% FBS. Human CC HT29 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium (Hyclone) containing 10% FBS.

Cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection and lysed in HEPES lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM NaF and 1 mM DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Immunoprecipitations were performed using the indicated primary antibody and protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were examined using the indicated primary antibodies followed by detection with the related secondary antibody and the SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). GST pull-down assay. Bacteria-expressed GST, GST-p53 or GST-MPG proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE, UK) and washed, and then beads were incubated with Myc-MPG or Myc-p53 expressed in H1299 cells and lysed in HEPES lysis buffer for 3 h at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C under rotation. Beads were washed with GST binding buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40 and protease inhibitor cocktail) and proteins were eluted, followed by western blotting. RNA interference. The MPG siRNA (5\u00a1\u00c7-AAGAAGCAGCGACCAGCTAGA-3\u00a1\u00c7), p53 siRNA (5\u00a1\u00c7-CUACUUCCUGAAAACAAC-3\u00a1\u00c7) and non-targeting siRNAs (5\u00a1\u00c7-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3\u00a1\u00c7) were synthesized by Shanghai GenePharm. All siRNAs were transfected into the cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed directly into sample buffer and resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Reporter gene assays. Luciferase reporter plasmids pG13-Luc (contains 13 tandem p53-binding elements) and pRL-CMV (internal control; from Promega) were co-transfected with plasmids indicated in figures. After transfection for 48 h, cells were lysed in 90 \u00a5\u00ecl of a passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time RT-PCR. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed as described previously 5. Sequences of primers of the p53 targeted genes used in qPCR assays are listed in Supplementary information, Table S1. Fluorescence analysis. For detection of colocalization by immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS). Proteins were stained using the indicated antibodies and detected with a TRITC-conjugated or FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma), and images were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta inverted confocal microscope. Cell cycle analysis. Cells were transfected with MPG siRNA and non-targeting siRNAS as control. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization, fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with propidium iodide (50 mg/ml) containing 1 mg/ml of RNase A at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C for 30 min and then analyzed for DNA content. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell nuclear extracts were made using a Nuclear Protein Extraction Kit (Fermantas). 10 \u00a5\u00ecg of nuclear extract was incubated with biotin labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to p53 binding sites in p21 promoter, 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2 promoter, the third intron of Gadd45 and puma promoter in gel shift binding buffer (10% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl 2, 0.2% NP40, 1 mg poly(dI-dC)). Unlabeled oligonucleotide was added in 200-fold excess as specific competitor. The DNA-protein complexes were then resolved by LightShift\u00a2\u00e7 Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probe sequences of p53 targets are listed as follows. p21: GTCAGGAACATGTCCCAACATGTTGAGCTC; 14-3-3\u00a5\u00f2: GTAGCATTAGCCCAGACATGTCC; Gadd45: GTACAGAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTGGGGAC; puma: CGCGCCTGCAAGTCCTGACTTGTCCGCGGC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. H1299 cells were transfected with the expression plasmid for p53 together with or without the expression plasmid for MPG. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C for 15 min. After being washed with ice-cold PBS, cells were suspended with 200 ml of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) on ice for 10 min. Lysates were sonicated and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were then precleared with 80 \u00a5\u00ecl protein-A beads for 1 h at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C. The precleared chromatin solutions were immunoprecipitated with normal mouse IgG or with anti-p53 antibody at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C overnight, followed by incubation with 60 ml of protein-A beads for 6 h at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C. The beads were washed once with low salt wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X100, 0.1% deoxycholate sodium, protease inhibitors), once with high salt wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X100, 0.1% deoxycholate sodium, protease inhibitors), once with LiCl wash buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholate sodium, 1 mM EDTA) and twice with 1 ml of TE buffer. Samples were eluted with 200 ml of the elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 M NaHCO 3) and then crosslinks were reversed by heating them at 65 \u00a1\u00c6C for 6 h. Chromatin-associated proteins were digested with proteinase K at 45 \u00a1\u00c6C for 1 h, and immunoprecipitated DNA was extracted with Phenol-chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. Purified DNA was analysed by real-time PCR, using the SYBR Green mix (Bio-Rad) with the MyIQ machine (Bio-Rad). Primers used for real-time PCR are available upon request. Measurement of intracellular NAD(P)H. To quantification of intracellular NAD(P)H levels, MCF7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and transfected with the indicated plasmids. After 24 h, they were treated with MMS (at the indicated concentrations) and CCK-8 solution (Dojindo Molecular Technology, Japan). The cells were then incubated for 4 h to allow formazan dye production, which was measured on a microplate spectrophotometer (SpectraMax 340PC384; Sunnyvale, CA) at 450 nm with 650 nm as the reference filter. The decrease in intracellular NAD(P)H levels were determined by comparing the absorbance of treated cells with that of the control. The means and standard errors for each cell line were calculated from at least three independent experiments, each in triplicate. Immunohistochemical staining. The human multiple tissue arrays (MTA) of BDC (OD-CT-RpBre03-004), LSCC (OD-CT-RsLug04-004) and CC (OD-CT-DgCol01-006) were purchased from Shanghai Outdo Biotech (Shanghai, China). The clinical characteristics of all of samples could be downloaded from the company's Web site: http://www.superchip.com.cn/web/index.asp. Various cancer tissues and their normal tissues counterparts on MTAs were incubated simultaneously with MPG (4 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml), p53 (2 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml) antibodies or relative control IgG overnight at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C. After washing with PBS, they were reacted with the biotin-labeled second antibody and then visualized using an ultrasensitive streptavidin-peroxidases system (Maxim Biotech, Fuzhou, China). The intensity of MPG and p53 for each individual case was quantified as described previously 43 and the percentage of expression were both graded as different scores. If the numerical value was higher or lower than that of the adjacent normal tissue, the expression of MPG and p53 in the tumor tissue was considered to be up-/down-regulated, respectively. Cell survival assay. MCF7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and transfected with the indicated plasmids. After 24 h, they were treated with MMS (at the indicated concentrations) 4 h, then drug-containing medium was removed and replaced with fresh growth medium. Cells were incubated for another 24 h, 0.05 mg/mL MTS reagent (Promega) was added to each well and incubated at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C for 4 h followed by absorbance measurement at 490 nm. The values were standardized to wells containing media alone. Comet assay. The single-cell gel electrophoresis or comet assay was used to determine the extent of DNA damage in individual MCF7 cells, which transfected with the indicated plasmids treated with MMS. After 36 h, cells were treated with MMS for 4 h and harvested by trypsinization. Alkaline comet assay was done according to the manufacturer's instructions of OxiSelect \u00a2\u00e2 Comet Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs, INC.). Comets were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy using a FITC filter 44. The comet lengths of 100 individual cells per group were measured for each treatment group. AP site determination assay. To determine number of AP sites formed, MCF7 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and treated with MMS. Cells were collected, and the genomic DNA was isolated using the Get-Pure DNA isolation kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Rockville, MD). The ARP reagent specifically reacts with the aldehyde group of AP sites in the open conformation, converting them to biotin-tagged AP sites. The amount of biotin can then be quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like assay 34. The number of AP sites formed was determined using the AP Site Quantitation kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies) as per the kit instructions 35. The experiments were repeated in triplicate, and the data presented are averages of three independent experiments with standard error. Statistical analysis. Statistical evaluation was carried out using a Student's t-test. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "K-RAS Mutant Pancreatic Tumors Show Higher Sensitivity to MEK than to PI3K Inhibition In Vivo\tActivating K-RAS mutations occur at a frequency of 90% in pancreatic cancer, and to date no therapies exist targeting this oncogene. K-RAS signals via downstream effector pathways such as the MAPK and the PI3K signaling pathways, and much effort has been focused on developing drugs targeting components of these pathways. To better understand the requirements for K-RAS and its downstream signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K in pancreatic tumor maintenance, we established an inducible K-RAS knock down system that allowed us to ablate K-RAS in established tumors. Knock down of K-RAS resulted in impaired tumor growth in all pancreatic xenograft models tested, demonstrating that K-RAS expression is indeed required for tumor maintenance of K-RAS mutant pancreatic tumors. We further examined signaling downstream of K-RAS, and detected a robust reduction of pERK levels upon K-RAS knock down. In contrast, no effect on pAKT levels could be observed due to almost undetectable basal expression levels. To investigate the requirement of the MAPK and the PI3K pathways on tumor maintenance, three selected pancreatic xenograft models were tested for their response to MEK or PI3K inhibition. Tumors of all three models regressed upon MEK inhibition, but showed less pronounced response to PI3K inhibition. The effect of MEK inhibition on pancreatic xenografts could be enhanced further by combined application of a PI3K inhibitor. These data provide further rationale for testing combinations of MEK and PI3K inhibitors in clinical trials comprising a patient population with pancreatic cancer harboring mutations in K-RAS. Introduction. The small GTPase K-RAS is frequently mutated in human cancers, with mutations occurring in 90% of non neuro-endocrine pancreatic tumors [1]. The presence of these mutations locks the protein in a constitutively activated form, which in turn results in enhanced stimulation of proliferative pathways, thus conferring a growth advantage on the cancer cell [2]. A number of genetic studies have shown that such activating K-RAS mutations are necessary for the onset of pancreatic cancer [3]?[5]. An inducible pancreas-specific expression system was used recently to show that K-RAS G12D expression is also required for tumor maintenance [6]. This renders K-RAS a highly validated target for which specific inhibitors are expected to lead to antitumor efficacy. Unfortunately, all attempts to develop such molecular entities have failed so far, placing this target in the so-called difficult-to-drug target category [7]?[8]. Alternative strategies rely on inhibition of key downstream effectors, an approach reminiscent to the hunt for synthetic lethal interactors [9]. K-RAS signals via a number of downstream effectors, amongst others RAF kinase, PI3 kinase (PI3K), exchange factors for the small GTPases RAL and RAC as well as phospholipase C \u00a5\u00e5 [10]. The RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) and the PI3K pathways are well described mediators of RAS induced transformation and tumorigenesis [11]?[12]. The in vivo significance of PI3K in K-RAS mediated tumorigenesis in the lung has been demonstrated using mice genetically engineered to carry a PI3K mutation deficient in RAS binding [13]. However, the role of either pathway in tumor maintenance is less clear. In the lung, it appears that MAPK signaling plays a more important role in tumor maintenance than PI3K signaling, since treatment of established K-RAS mutant lung tumors was more effective using MEK inhibitors than using PI3K inhibitors [14]?[15]. In pancreatic tumors, there are hints that the PI3K as well as the MAPK pathway might be involved in tumor maintenance [16]?[19]. However, the function of these pathways in tumor maintenance of the pancreatic lineage still needs further elucidation, since a better understanding of the contribution of K-RAS effectors to tumor maintenance might help to identify therapies alternative to targeting K-RAS itself. There is a trend towards treatment with combinations of inhibitors rather than with single inhibitors. The importance of tumor-host interactions is well known in the case of pancreatic cancer, with hedgehog as well as PI3K signaling playing an important role in regulating the tumor stroma [20]?[21]. Targeting both tumor cells as well as the tumor stroma might therefore be necessary to effectively treat such cancers. Furthermore, in K-RAS mutant tumors in which K-RAS signals via multiple effector pathways, inhibition of several of these pathways is likely to be more effective than targeting just a single one. Finally, there are feedback loops between the MAPK and the PI3K pathway, which can result in activation of one pathway upon inhibition of the other, and in this way confer resistance to single agent treatment [15], [22]?[23]. Combinations of MEK and PI3K inhibitors have been tested in models of K-RAS mutant breast, lung and colorectal cancer, and were shown to be superior to single agent treatment [14]?[15], [24]?[26]. It remains to be seen if such combination treatment can be successfully applied to K-RAS mutant pancreatic models as well. In this study, we set out to better understand the involvement of K-RAS as well as of the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways in tumor maintenance of pancreatic cancer models in vivo. We developed an inducible K-RAS knock down system which allowed us to confirm requirement of pancreatic tumor maintenance on K-RAS. Having shown K-RAS dependence of our model system, we next tested involvement of the MEK or PI3K pathways in the maintenance of K-RAS dependent tumors. Response to MEK or PI3K inhibition was tested in three selected xenograft models, all of which showed tumor regression upon MEK inhibitor treatment, but not upon PI3K inhibitor treatment. Thus, all pancreatic models tested were more dependent on MAPK than on PI3K signaling. As PI3K plays important roles in regulating the tumor stroma, combined inhibition of MEK and PI3K might prove beneficial to single agent treatment despite minor effects of PI3K inhibition on tumor growth. Indeed, combining MEK and PI3K inhibitors led to superior effects compared to single agent treatment. Results. K-RAS is Required for Tumor Maintenance in vivo. Expression of mutant K-RAS is known to be required for tumor maintenance in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer [6]. To expand on this study, and to confirm the relevance of the findings in human cancer models, we established doxycycline-inducible K-RAS shRNA expression in five K-RAS mutant human pancreatic cell lines (Capan-1, Panc 10.05, AsPC-1, L3.3 and PANC-1) (Table S1). Doxycycline treatment led to effective K-RAS knock down upon K-RAS specific sh236 and sh562 expression in all lines tested in vitro. In contrast, no knock down was observed in the non-targeting shRNA (shNT) control pools (Figure 1A). With the exception of the L3.3 line, for which leaky expression of sh562 resulted in increased doubling times, all five K-RAS mutant pancreatic models showed impaired growth upon expression of either sh236 or sh562 when tested in proliferation assays (Figure 1B and Figure S1). No effect on growth was observed when sh236 was expressed in the K-RAS wild type lung line NCI-H1437, despite significant reduction of K-RAS protein levels, demonstrating the specificity of K-RAS knock down (Figure S2). Overall, these data confirm previously published findings showing dependence of in vitro proliferation on expression of mutant K-RAS in pancreatic cell lines [27]?[29]. Next, we examined effects of K-RAS knockdown on downstream signaling, and found a robust decrease of pERK levels in the Capan-1, Panc 10.05 and L3.3 lines. With the exception of the AsPC1 line, pAKT levels were found to be almost unaffected upon K-RAS knockdown (Figure 1A). We next tested K-RAS dependence in vivo by performing nude mouse xenograft studies with four out of the five human K-RAS mutant lines (Capan-1, Panc10.05, AsPC-1 and L3.3) described above, as well as for the wild type K-RAS control line NCI-H1437. The functionality of the K-RAS knock down system in these models was first assessed by treating tumor-bearing mice with doxycycline for 7 days. This resulted in a 60 to 80% reduction of K-RAS transcript levels upon expression of shRNA236, in contrast to the non-targeting shRNA control (Figure 2A). Hence, this system is suitable for studying the role of K-RAS expression in already established tumors. Long-term doxycycline treatment of sh236 Capan1 tumor bearing mice resulted in significant antitumor activity leading to tumor stasis. No antitumor activity was observed in shNT Capan1 tumor bearing mice, showing that inhibition of tumor growth is not caused by unspecific effects of doxycycline treatment (Figure 2B). Similar studies were performed with the Panc 10.05, AsPC-1 and L3.3 models, for which doxycycline treatment resulted in tumor growth inhibition in all three cases (Figure 2C). The effects were always statistically significant when the tumor volumes across the entire study were considered by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) (Figure 2B/C and Table S2). Ablation of K-RAS expression in the NCI-H1437 tumors, however, did not result in impaired tumor growth, and thus shows K-RAS independence of this model for tumor maintenance in vivo (Figure 2A and 2C). In conclusion, we showed that mutant K-RAS is required for tumor maintenance of the pancreatic lineage in an in vivo xenograft system using human cancer cell lines. K-RAS Signals via MAPK in vivo. Tumor-stroma interactions have been shown to play a critical role in pancreatic cancer [6], [20]?[21], [30]. Hence, signaling events specific to the tumor environment can not be captured in in vitro systems. Our K-RAS dependent model system allows in vivo investigation of downstream signaling pathways employed by mutant K-RAS. pERK and pAKT levels were examined as readout for MAPK and PI3K pathway activity respectively by immunohistochemistry, as this has the advantage to allow discrimination of tumor tissue from tumor stroma. Basal pERK levels were readily detectable and were substantially decreased after 7 days of K-RAS shRNA expression in all four models (Capan-1, Panc 10.05, AsPC-1 and L3.3), whereas no changes were observed when the non-targeting shRNA was expressed. Hence, ERK is activated downstream of K-RAS in these tumor models (Figure 3A). In sharp contrast, basal pAKT levels were found to be very low - almost undetectable - in all tumors tested. As positive control, pAKT expression was also determined and shown to be detectable in sections of the PI3K mutant, AKT-dependent breast cancer T47D tumors. (Figure 3B) [31]. It has to be noted that the effect of K-RAS knockdown on downstream phosphoprotein levels does not completely correlate between in vivo and in vitro settings, with pERK levels being affected strongly across all in vivo models (Figure 1A). To exclude the possibility that even such low levels of pAKT could be sufficient to promote physiologically relevant signaling, sensitivity to the AKT inhibitor MK2206 was tested in vitro [32]. As expected, the control line T47D was sensitive to MK2206, reflected by nanomolar GI 50 values (GI 50=140 nM). In contrast, no significant effect of AKT inhibition was seen on the pancreatic cell lines in vitro, with GI 50 values of above 10 \u00a5\u00ecM for the Capan1, Panc10.05 and AsPc1 lines, and a GI 50 of 1.54 \u00a5\u00ecM for the L3.3 line (Figure 4A). In addition, we tested response of a larger panel of K-RAS mutant pancreatic cell lines to the PI3K inhibitor GDC0941 and to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 [33]-[35]. GI 50 values of a few pancreatic lines were close to the GI 50=80 nM observed for the sensitive line MCF7, however, none of the pancreatic lines was as sensitive as the line MCF7 (Figure 4B). In contrast, 50% of lines tested for sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 showed GI 50 values comparable to the values obtained for the sensitive line A-375 (GI 50=34 nM) (Figure 4C). Thus, a substantial number of K-RAS mutant pancreatic lines were sensitive to MEK inhibition in vitro. Pancreatic Models Show Higher Sensitivity to MEK than to PI3K Inhibition in vivo. Having shown K-RAS dependence of the xenograft models, the question as to the role of the downstream pathways MAPK and PI3K in tumor maintenance arises. Selected nude mouse xenograft models were tested for antitumor response to the PI3K inhibitor GDC0941 or the MEK inhibitor AZD6244. Rat1-myr-p110\u00a5\u00e1 tumors were used as control for PI3K dependence, whereas A-375 tumors were our control for MEK dependence. As expected, Rat1-myr-p110\u00a5\u00e1 tumors showed slight tumor regression upon treatment at the reported efficacious dose level of the PI3K inhibitor GDC0941 (T/C=?3%), but tumors did not regress upon treatment with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (T/C=29%) [36]. In contrast, A-375 tumors, harboring an activating B-RAF mutation, responded strongly to AZD6244 (T/C=?28%), but did not show significant sensitivity to GDC0941 (T/C=66%) (Figure 5A). We then tested the response of three pancreatic models (MIA PaCa-2, L3.3 and Panc 10.05). The MIA PaCa-2 model was included because the cell line showed the highest sensitivity to MEK inhibition amongst the pancreatic lines tested in vitro (Figure 4C). Interestingly, all three models displayed statistically significant tumor regression upon treatment with AZD6244 (T/C(MIA PaCa-2)=?14%, T/C(L3.3)=?12%, T/C(Panc 10.05)=?24%), while modest growth inhibition but no tumor regression was observed in response to GDC0941 treatment (T/C(MIA PaCa-2)=69%, T/C(L3.3)=18%, T/C(Panc 10.05)=44%) (Figure 5B). It has to be noted that in vivo efficacy correlated poorly with in vitro sensitivity, and so in vitro data might not be useful for predicting the in vivo response of pancreatic cancer models (Figure 4B and C). Drug plasma levels were comparable between the Rat1-myr-p110\u00a5\u00e1 and the Panc 10.05 models after a single treatment, indicating sufficient absorption of either compound (Figure 6A and B). Moreover, respective targets were found to be inhibited in both models, with very low pERK and pAKT levels following drug exposure. As expected, basal pAKT levels were low in the pancreatic model Panc 10.05, and so inhibition of pAKT seemed less pronounced compared to the high pAKT-expressing model Rat1-myr-p110\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure 6C and D). In conclusion, all three pancreatic models tested in vivo showed higher dependence on MAPK than on PI3K signaling, indicating that it is the MAPK pathway playing the major role in tumor maintenance. Combining MEK and PI3K Inhibition in vivo is Superior to Single Agent Treatment. A number of studies have reported synergy for combined use of MEK and PI3K inhibitors in K-RAS mutant breast, lung and colorectal tumor models [14]?[15], [24]?[26]. PI3K inhibition had limited effect on tumor growth in the pancreatic models tested, however, PI3K has well described functions in the tumor stroma of pancreatic cancers, and therefore combined application of a PI3K and a MEK inhibitor might prove beneficial by targeting both tumor cells as well as stromal cells [20]. As expected, treatment of nude mice bearing MIA-PaCa-2 tumors with the PI3K inhibitor GDC0941 alone resulted in limited tumor growth inhibition (T/C=41%). Treatment with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 alone was done at a lower dose of 5 mg/kg and led to a similar tumor growth inhibition with a T/C of 33%. Notably, combining GDC0941 and AZD6244 showed synergistic tumor regression with a T/C of ?20% (Figure 7A). pAKT and pERK were found inhibited upon exposure to a single dose of respective compound, as well as upon combination treatment (Figure 7C). To test the effect of the MEK/PI3K combination on a second K-RAS mutant pancreatic xenograft model, nude mice bearing Panc 10.05 tumors were treated with AZD6244, GDC0941 or the combination of both. Treatment with either inhibitor alone resulted in tumor growth inhibition with a T/C of 47% upon AZD6244 application and a T/C of 12% upon GDC0944 application. As observed for the MIA PaCa-2 model, combination of AZD6244 and GDC0941 led to tumor regression with a T/C of ?33% (Figure S3). Thus, combining MEK and PI3K inhibitors is superior to single agent treatment in two in vivo models of the pancreatic lineage. Discussion. Patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are commonly treated with the chemotherapeutic gemcitabine. As 5 year survival rates are very low (<5%), new therapies are clearly needed [37]. Genetic mouse models have helped to understand the crucial role of activating K-RAS mutations in the onset and maintenance of pancreatic cancer [3]?[6]. To investigate K-RAS dependent tumor maintenance of human cell lines, we generated an inducible K-RAS shRNA knock down system which allowed us to ablate K-RAS expression in established tumors. In all four pancreatic xenograft models studied, we observed impaired tumor growth upon K-RAS knock down. Thus, as in the genetic mouse model, K-RAS is required for tumor maintenance of human xenografts of the pancreatic lineage in vivo. No specific inhibitors targeting K-RAS have been developed to date, and so the identification of the key effectors mediating tumor maintenance might lead to alternative therapeutic opportunities. Such downstream targeting has the caveat that the oncogene itself stays active and inhibition might therefore not be complete. As all attempts to target K-RAS have failed so far, targeting downstram signaling pathway seems a promising alternative at present [7]. Notably, all three pancreatic xenograft models tested in vivo showed regression upon MEK, but not upon PI3K inhibition. This indicates higher dependence of established pancreatic tumors on MAPK than on PI3K signaling. Similar results have been described for K-RAS induced lung tumors, with MEK but not PI3K inhibition leading to tumor regression [14]?[15]. Therefore, MAPK signaling might - in addition to its prominent role in the lung - also play a major role in the maintenance of pancreatic tumors. Future studies will be needed to understand if this might be a more general phenomenon across K-RAS mutant tumors. At present, the mechanism explaining the stronger response to MEK than to PI3K inhibition in the pancreatic xenografts examined is not known. We showed K-RAS to signal via MAPK, and so it is tempting to speculate that sensitivity to MEK inhibitors is linked to pathway activity in these models. A few in vivo models of K-RAS mutant pancreatic cancers have been described to be sensitive to MEK inhibition, whereas K-RAS mutations have been shown to be predictive of resistance to treatment with PI3K inhibitors in several tumor types [17]?[19]. The mechanism of insensitivity to PI3K inhibition was not further elucidated in these publications, and future studies will be required to gain such insight. None of these studies have directly compared response to MEK versus PI3K inhibition. Inhibition of PI3K actually resulted in tumor growth inhibition in the model L3.3, though to a less dramatic extent than upon MEK inhibition. As was the case for all pancreatic models tested, the L3.3 model showed low pAKT levels and independence of AKT signaling. PI3K signaling appears to depend upon PDK1 rather than AKT in several breast cancer cell lines harboring the H1047R mutation in PIK3CA, and thus it remains to be seen if a similar mechanism exists in the L3.3 model [38]. Moreover, the L3.3 line is wild type for p53, whereas all other lines tested in vivo harbor mutations in the gene. It would be interesting to investigate if there is a link between p53 status and response to PI3K inhibition. A number of PI3K and MEK inhibitors are currently being developed and tested in clinical studies [39]?[40]. PI3K inhibitors have been tested in phase I studies in patients with solid tumors with promising outcomes [41]. However, no phase II data is available yet, and thus future studies need to be awaited to conclude upon the effectiveness of such inhibitors. AZD6244 has been tested in a phase II study in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, with the outcome of no statistically significant difference in overall survival between AZD6244 and standard of care [42]. This result is in disagreement to our data, showing regression of K-RAS mutant pancreatic tumors in xenograft models. It must be noted that the clinical trial was performed as second-line treatment on a patient population with advanced pancreatic cancer who have failed first-line gemcitabine therapy. It is possible that MEK inhibition as first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer might prove to be more effective. In vitro, MEK inhibition was not effective in a gemcitabine resistant pancreatic line established by exposure to the chemotherapeutic [43]. Furthermore, hypoxia has been used to induce gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cell lines, and such cells proved to be unresponsive to MEK inhibition. Interestingly, the same cell line was sensitive to gemcitabine as well as to MEK inhibition under normoxic conditions [44]. These data indicate that MEK inhibitors might indeed not be effective on gemcitabine resistant cells. Such gemcitabine resistance could be reversed in a genetic mouse model of pancreatic cancer by inhibition of the hedgehog pathway, which mediated remodeling of the tumor stroma and thus facilitated uptake of gemcitabine into the tumor [45]. Hence one could speculate that a PI3K inhibitor as well as other modalities might have similar effects on the stromal compartment, leading to increased drug penetration of the tumor and in this way to increased gemcitabine sensitivity [20], [46]?[49]. Moreover, target inhibition in the tumors was not determined in this phase II study, and it is possible that pERK levels were not sufficiently decreased to show efficacy. Tumors generally show vascular abnormalities, with dilated, irregular vessels which are poorly functional [50]. Pancreatic tumors are known to be hypoperfused and therefore show limited uptake of drugs [51]. This phenomenon is less prevalent in the case of transplanted tumors like the xenograft models used in our study [45]. Thus, it is possible that MEK inhibition had limited success in above mentioned trial because the drug could not sufficiently enter the tumors. Targeting the tumor stroma in a genetic mouse model of pancreatic cancer led to changes in the tumor vasculature which allowed increased uptake of the drug into the tumor, resulting in improved efficacy [45]. A number of publications have shown that GDC0941 as well as other PI3K inhibitors lead to remodeling of the tumor vasculature, resulting in increased drug uptake [46]?[49]. Combined application of PI3K inhibitors might therefore be generally beneficial in enhancing the delivery of drugs into the tumor. When we treated nude mice bearing MiaPaCa-2 tumors - which showed limited sensitivity to PI3K inhibition in vivo - with a combination of a MEK and a PI3K inhibitor, we observed an effect superior to MEK inhibition alone. A second xenograft model, mice bearing Panc 10.05 tumors, responded similarly and showed benefit of combined administration of a MEK and a PI3K inhibitor. This indicates that K-RAS mutant pancreatic xenografts might generally show superior response upon MEK/PI3K inhibitor combination treatment. The mechanism of this synergy has not been investigated, however, it is possible that the combination is beneficial by targeting both tumor cells and tumor stroma. Future studies are clearly needed to support this hypothesis, and to investigate if PI3K inhibition aids the uptake of the MEK inhibitor into the tumor. Combination treatment of K-RAS mutant breast, lung and colorectal tumors with a MEK and a PI3K inhibitor has been shown to be superior to single agent treatment. Frequently, the combination led to enhanced induction of apoptosis [14]?[15], [24]?[26]. Moreover, resistance to MEK inhibition was found to be mediated by activation of PI3K signaling in several lineages, and inhibition of both pathways showed synergistic effects [22]?[23]. It remains to be seen whether a similar resistance mechanism takes place in pancreatic tumors; the existence of which would provide better understanding of the synergy seen with the PI3K and MEK inhibitor combination. Our data on combining MEK and PI3K inhibition in pancreatic xenograft models supports use of this combination for future clinical trials. Indeed, such combination trials are currently being prepared, and the results of these are eagerly awaited with the hope that such treatment will result in improved responses in the clinic.

All lines were cultured at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, 5% CO 2 and 80% relative humidity in DMEM high glucose (Gibco, Carlsbad, USA) complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (20% in case of the cell line Capan1), 2 mM glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cell Lysate Preparation and Immunoblotting. Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 1% NP40 lysis buffer. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13000 rpm to remove cellular debris, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford test. Tumor lysates were prepared by homogenizing the tumors, resuspending the powder in 1% NP40 lysis buffer followed by a centrifugation step for 10 min at 13000 rpm and determination of the protein concentration. Western blotting was done on PVDF membranes using PBS/Tween (0.1%) milk and the following antibodies: AKT (Epitomics, Burlingame, USA; #1085-1, 11000), pAKT (Ser473; CST, Canvers, USA; #9271, 11000), ERK (CST #9102, 11000), pERK (Thr202/Tyr204; CST #9101, 11000), and K-RAS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, USA; #sc?30, 1200).

HEK 293FT cells were transfected with DNA-Lipofectamine complexes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) containing pVPR\u00a5\u00c48.71, pVSVG and LKO-Tet-ON vector [52]. The next day, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mM sodium butyrate were added to the medium for 8 h. Virus was harvested 24 h later, filtered and titrated in MIA PaCa-2 cells. Cells were spinfected at 2000 rpm for 2 h in medium containing Tet-free FCS and 8 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml polybrene at an MOI=1.

Target sequences of shRNAs: K-RAS sh236: 5\u00a1\u00c7 GATACAGCTAATTCAGAATC 3\u00a1\u00c7; K-RAS sh562: 5\u00a1\u00c7 AGGCTCAGGACTTAGCAAGA 3\u00a1\u00c7; shNT: 5\u00a1\u00c7 GGATAATGGTGATTGAGATGG 3\u00a1\u00c7. Proliferation Assay. Cells were plated in 96 well plates with 6 replicates per condition. The next day, doxycycline was added at 200 ng/ml and changed every 3 days. Cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde at indicated days, stained in methylene blue, washed, the dye was eluted in 3% HCl, and the plates were read at OD=650 nm. Statistics were calculated by performing a t-test; p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. In cases where the equal variance or the normality test failed, a Whitney- Mann test was performed. For determination of GI 50 values, cell lines were plated in 96 well plates. The next day, cells were treated with the AKT inhibitor MK2206 at compound concentrations ranging from 10 \u00a5\u00ecM to 1 nM (from 20 \u00a5\u00ecM to 1 nM for treatment with the PI3K inhibitor GDC0941 or the MEK inhibitor AZD6244). After an incubation of 72 h, cells were fixed and stained as described above. Conditions were done in duplicate, and at least 2 independent experiments were performed for each cell line. qPCR. RNA was isolated from frozen tumor powder and 2 \u00a5\u00ecg RNA were reverse transcribed (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). qPCR reactions were performed with 40 ng of transcribed RNA (qPCR core kit for SYBR Green, Eurogentec, Liege, Belgium) using following primers designed to be human-specific and to cross an exon-intron boundary: K-RAS: forward 5\u00a1\u00c7 ctaaatcatttgaagatattcacc 3\u00a1\u00c7; reverse 5\u00a1\u00c7ctgatgtttcaataaaaggaattc 3\u00a1\u00c7. qPCR of RPS18 was done using the TaqMan probe 4319413E (Applied Biosystems). Statistics were calculated by performing a t-test; p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. In cases where the equal variance or the normality test failed, a Whitney-Mann test was performed. Immunohistochemistry. Tumors were fixed after dissection in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h at RT, rinsed in PBS, processed for dehydration, cleared and paraffinized. After embedding in paraffin, 3 \u00a5\u00ecm sections were prepared. IHC staining was done on a Discovery XT platform (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA) using CC ultra mild epitope recovery conditions for pERK and CC ultra extended for pAKT. The detection system used was OmniMap DAB anti?Rabbit (HRP) detection kit (Ventana Medical Systems). Slides were hematoxylin counterstained and antibodies used were pAKT (Ser473; CST #4060, 125) and pERK (Thr202/Tyr204; CST #4370, 1400). Xenograft Studies. For K-RAS knock down studies in vivo, female Harlan nude mice (Harlan Inc., Indianapolis, USA) were injected s.c. with 5 million cells in 100 \u00a5\u00ecl HBSS, the Panc 10.05 cells were injected with 50% Matrigel. At a tumor volume of around 100 mm 3 (200?300 mm 3 for one-week treatments), mice were randomized to one of two groups and treated in the presence or absence of doxycycline. Doxycycline treatment was done by adding 2 mg/ml doxycycline in 10% sucrose in the drinking water. Tumor volumes were followed over time and are shown as mean volume +/? standard error of the mean. At the end of each study, tumors were excised and processed for IHC or qPCR. Tumor volumes were determined by using calipers for measurement of longest (considered as length) and shortest (considered as diameter) dimensions of each tumor and according to the formula V=(\u00a5\u00f0 * L * (D 2))/6, with L=tumor length and D=tumor diameter. Statistics were calculated by performing a t-test. p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. For inhibitor studies of pancreatic models in vivo, female Harlan nude mice were injected s.c. with 10 million cells in 100 \u00a5\u00ecl HBSS, the MIA PaCa-2 and the Panc 10.05 cells were injected with 50% Matrigel. At a tumor volume of around 600 mm 3, tumor pieces were transplanted s.c. Once these tumors were established to a size of around 100 mm 3, mice were randomized to one of three groups. The Rat1-myr-p110\u00a5\u00e1 and the A-375 model were established by injecting 5 million cells s.c. GDC0941 and AZD6244 (free base) were formulated in NMP/PEG300 (10/90, V/V). GDC0941 was given at 100 mg/kg once a day p.o., AZD6244 at 50 mg/kg twice a day p.o. and NMP-PEG was given twice a day p.o. Tumor volumes were followed over time and are shown as mean volume +/? standard error of the mean. When required, tumors were excised at the end of the study and processed for Western blot, and blood was taken for PK studies. Antitumor activity is expressed as T/C% (mean increase of tumor volumes of treated animals divided by the mean increase of tumor volumes of control animals multiplied by 100). For combination studies, female Harlan nude mice were injected s.c. with 5 million MIA PaCa-2 cells in 100 \u00a5\u00ecl HBSS containing 50% Matrigel. Once tumors were established to a size of around 150 mm 3, mice were randomized to one of four groups. GDC0941 and AZD6244 (free base) were formulated in NMP/PEG300 (10/90, V/V). GDC0941 was given at 100 mg/kg once a day p.o., AZD6244 at 5 mg/kg once a day p.o. and NMP-PEG was given once a day p.o. The combination was given at 100 mg/kg GDC0941 once a day p.o., and 5 mg/kg AZD6244 once a day p.o. Tumor volumes were followed over time and are shown as mean volume +/? standard error of the mean. Synergy was determined using the Clarke method [53]. Statistical analysis was done by a one way ANOVA Tukey test; p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. In case the normality or the equal variance test failed during this analysis, log tranformed data was used for the one way ANOVA Tukey test. In case of normality or equal variance tests failing for both untransformed and log transformed data, an ANOVA on ranks test was performed. Determination of Compound Plasma Concentrations. Mouse plasma was chromatographically separated by HPLC (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) on a RESECT\u00a2\u00e2 Ultra Phenyl reverse-phase column. Compound concentrations were determined using a Quattro Micro\u00a2\u00e2 mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, USA) by comparison to a compound standard. Supporting Information. Figure S1. The L3.3 sh562 cell line shows increased doubling times. Indicated L3.3 pools were either exposed to 200 ng/ml of doxycycline (dox) or not exposed to doxycycline (no dox) for 7 days, and relative cell numbers were quantified. The doubling time was subsequently calculated using the following formula: doubling time=t*((LN(2))/(LN(OD650-t2/OD650-t1)), with t=incubation time, OD650-t2=OD650 after 7 days of growth, OD650-t1=OD650 at time of doxycycline addition. (TIF) Figure S2. Proliferation of the K-RAS wt line NCI-H1437 is not affected upon K-RAS knock down. (A) NCI-H1437 cell pools (NT: non-targeting shRNA; 236: shRNA targeting K-RAS) were either treated for 7 days with 200 ng/ml of doxycycline (dox) or left untreated (no dox), followed by preparation of cell lysates. Corresponding cell extracts were then analyzed for K-RAS and total AKT levels by Western Blot. (B) As in (A), except that cells were fixed on day 1 and day 7, followed by determination of proliferation. Each cell line was tested in at least two independent experiments and untreated samples were set to 100% of growth. (TIF) Figure S3. Combined application of a PI3K and a MEK inhibitor is superior to single agent treatment in the model Panc 10.05. Indicated tumor-bearing mice were treated either with GDC0941 100 mg/kg p.o. once a day, or with AZD6244 5 mg/kg p.o. once a day, or with the combination of both, or with vehicle control, with 6 mice per group. Tumor volumes were measured twice a week, for the indicated period of time, and antitumor activity was plotted and quantified. (TIF) Table S1. Mutational status of pancreatic cell lines used. The mutational status of K-RAS, TP53, CDKN2A and SMAD4 of the panel of pancreatic cell lines was collected from the Cosmic database or from Oncomap. In cases where K-RAS mutation status was not available, sequencing was performed internally (NVS). Cell lines in bold were tested in vivo. (PPT) Table S2. Antitumor activities obtained in pancreatic models upon K-RAS knock down. Data shown in Figure 2B and 2C was analyzed by calculating the doubling time of the tumors, T/C (treatment/control) on day 18 (minimum treatment period), T/C on the last day of each study, and \u00a5\u00c4 tumor volume between the start and end of the study, as well as the area under the curve (AUC). Statistics were calculated by performing a t-test. No t-test calculation was possible for the doubling time of the model Capan-1 K-RAS sh236, as there was no tumor growth for 2 tumors in the doxycycline treated group resulting in infinite doubling times. An outlier determined by the Grubb\u00a1\u00afs test amongst the doubling times calculated for the model AsPC-1 K-RAS sh236 was not considered in the analysis. (PPT) Acknowledgments.

One of these inhibitors, ICPD 34, causes a structural change that affects a mobile loop, which adopts a conformation similar to that seen in complexes with ADP, rather than the conformation generally seen with the pyrazole/isoxazole-resorcinol class of inhibitors. Competitive binding to the Hsp90 N-terminal domain was observed in a biochemical assay, and these compounds showed antiproliferative activity and induced apoptosis in the HCT116 human colon cancer cell line. These inhibitors also caused induction of the heat shock response with the upregulation of Hsp72 and Hsp27 protein expression and the depletion of Hsp90 clients, CRAF, ERBB2 and CDK4, thus confirming that antiproliferative activity was through the inhibition of Hsp90. The presence of increased levels of the cleavage product of PARP indicated apoptosis in response to Hsp90 inhibitors. This work provides a framework for the further optimization of thiadiazole inhibitors of Hsp90. Importantly, we demonstrate that the thiadiazole inhibitors display a more limited core set of interactions relative to the clinical trial candidate NVP-AUY922, and consequently may be less susceptible to resistance derived through mutations in Hsp90. Introduction. The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is responsible for the maturation and activation of specific client proteins that are key components of signal-transduction pathways that regulate growth and proliferation. These clients include numerous oncogenic proteins such as steroid-hormone receptors and kinases (ERBB2, EGFR, ALK, CRAF, BRAF and CDK4). The ATPase activity of Hsp90 is crucial for the activation of such client proteins. ATP binding to the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 leads to a series of structural changes that promote N-terminal dimerization [1], while binding Hsp90 inhibitors that target the ATP binding site of Hsp90 prevents these conformational changes and leads to the degradation of its client proteins [2]. The natural antibiotic Hsp90-inhibitors, geldanamycin and radicicol, target the N-terminal ATP-binding site of Hsp90. Inhibition elicits proteosomal degradation of Hsp90 client-proteins by a ubiquitination-mediated process, which may involve the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP [3]. Radicicol has no activity in vivo due to its instability and geldanamycin displays significant toxicity that precludes its use as an effective anticancer drug. This led to the development of the geldanamycin derivative 17-allylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG, tanespimycin) [4], [5], [6], which has shown clinical activity in phase I/II clinical trials [7], [8], [9], [10]. Despite its clinical activity, most promisingly in trastuzumab-refractory ErbB2-positive breast cancer [10], 17-AAG suffers from a limited aqueous solubility, low oral bioavailability [10], [11], susceptibility to the metabolic activities of polymorphic enzymes (CYP3A4 and NQO1/DT-diaphorase [5], [12], [13]), and hepatotoxicity [7], [8], [9]. More water-soluble derivatives of geldanamycin, 17-DMAG (alvespimycin) and IPI-504 (retaspimycin), have entered clinical trials [10], [14], [15], [16]. Currently, radicicol derivatives have not entered clinical trial. Cancer cells appear to be more susceptible to Hsp90 inhibition than normal cells [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22] and consequently there have been considerable efforts to develop synthetic small molecule inhibitors against the ATP-binding site of Hsp90 [23], [24]. The first synthetic small molecule to be identified as a Hsp90 ATPase-inhibitor was based on a purine scaffold [25], [26]. Another class of small molecules, the 3-4-diaryl pyrazole resorcinols, was then identified. The pyrazoles are exemplified by the prototype CCT018159 [27], [28], [29], and were further optimized to produce the pyrazole- and isoxazole-amide resorcinol analogues [30], [31], from which the isoxazole NVP-AUY922 (VER52296, Fig. 1) emerged as a clinical trial candidate that is now showing promise in Phase II clinical trials [32], [33], [34]. These new agents overcome many of the liabilities of the geldanamycin class, including hepatotoxicity that could be attributed to the quinone group [23], [24]. While mechanisms of resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors have so far not emerged in the clinic, it has been clearly demonstrated that resistance to the natural product inhibitors, geldanamycin and radicicol, is possible through mutation leading to altered amino-acid residues in the ATP-binding site of Hsp90 [35], [36]. Thus it appears that the ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90, although highly conserved, can nevertheless tolerate mutagenic changes leading to resistance against these inhibitors. Potentially, such mutations may eventually be seen in the clinic and consequently the development of a variety of structurally diverse inhibitors, that interact purely with highly conserved residues that form the central components of the ATP-binding site of Hsp90, is all the more important. The present series of the 5-aryl-4-(5-substituted-2-4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1,2,3-thiadiazoles (ICPD 26, 34 and 47) were recently synthesized (Fig. 1) and shown to be effective Hsp90 inhibitors in terms of binding to Hsp90 [37]. The dissociation constant for the binding of these inhibitors to full-length Hsp90\u00a5\u00e1 varied from 4.8 to 39.0 nM. Here we determine the molecular and structural biological details of this inhibition, demonstrate using biomarkers that these agents inhibit Hsp90 in cancer cells, and show that they exhibit antiproliferative activity and induce apoptosis in the human colon cancer cell line HCT116. Importantly, we demonstrate that the thiadiazole inhibitors display a more limited core set of interactions relative to the clinical trial candidate NVP-AUY922, and consequently may be less susceptible to resistance derived through mutations in the N-terminal ATP site of Hsp90. Results. Protein X-ray Crystallography. ICPD 26, 34 and 47 (Fig. 1) essentially bind to Hsp90 in the same way (Fig. 2 and Table 1). A crucial network of hydrogen bonding between the resorcinol group and highly conserved amino-acid residues, Leu 48, Ser 52, Asp 93, Gly 97 and Thr 184, of the ATP-binding site is present as previously seen with pyrazole and isoxazole resorcinol inhibitors [27], [28], [32] (Fig. 2). Hydrophobic interactions that are also conserved include those with Asn 51, Ala 55, Met 98 and Phe 138 (Fig. 2). The interaction between Gly 97 and the monoethylamide group of NVP-AUY922 has previously shown to be important for the potency of this compound [21], [31]. The main-chain carbonyl group of Gly 97 does not form a hydrogen bond interaction with the ICPD compounds (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the sulphur atom in the thiadiazole ring of the ICPD compounds is not optimally positioned to form an interaction with the carbonyl of Gly 197 (Fig. 2). The chlorine atom in ICPD 34 and ICPD 47 and the interactions it makes has been previously explored with other compounds containing chlorine at the same position. The interactions made by the chlorine atom are consistent with these reports [27], [28], [32]. Although the ICPD compounds bind Hsp90 in similar ways, the K d values for the binding of ICPD 26 and ICPD 47 (7.5 and 4.8 nM, respectively) and ICPD 34 (K d=39.0 nM) are very different, with ICPD 34 being less potent (Fig. 1). ICPD 26 is similar to ICPD 34, except that it lacks a 3-methoxy group (Fig. 1 and ?and2).2). The presence of this group in ICPD 34 has a profound effect on a short mobile loop (Asp 105 to Ile 110) that consequently adopts an open conformation and fails to interact with the bound inhibitor (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, amino-acid residues 111?131 become completely disordered (Fig. 3A). With ICPD 26 and 47 this loop adopts a more compact conformation interacting with the bound inhibitor. For a variety of pyrazole and isoxazole inhibitors the conformation of the loop is either in an open (pdb 2BYI and 2BYH) or compact conformation (pdb 2CCU, 2VCJ, 2CCT, 2CCS, 2BSM and 2BT0). For the clinical trial candidate NVP-AUY922 (pdb 2VCI) the loop is in the apparent favored compact state. It therefore appears that the binding affinity of ICPD 34 is negatively affected by having to promote a conformational change that moves the short mobile loop to a more open conformation and causes disorder in the amino-acid residues from Asp 105 to Ile 110, and/or by failing to interact with the loop itself. This could potentially explain the weaker binding of ICPD 34, relative to ICPD 26 and 47 (Fig. 1?3). Consequently, optimizing interactions between this mobile loop and future Hsp90 inhibitors could provide higher affinity binding inhibitors as has been observed for the morpholino- and monoethylamide-group of NVP-AUY922 (pdb 2VCI). Such interactions should be directed towards amino acid residues closest to the bound inhibitors, which include the highly conserved Leu 107, Gly 108 and Thr 109 amino-acid residues. However, because these residues are found at the periphery of the ATP-binding site they may be subject to mutational changes that could result in resistance. Resistance through mutagenesis of the ATP-binding site of Hsp90 has recently been shown against both radicicol and geldanamycin [35], [36]. Interestingly, resistance to geldanamycin involved amino acid changes (E88G and N92L) that are at the entrance to the ATP-binding site of Hsp90. In contrast, resistance to radicicol involved an amino acid change (L34I) at the base of the ATP-binding pocket. However, because of the less bulky nature of the thiadiazoles and the simpler set of interactions that these compounds make with Hsp90, they have the potential to be potent inhibitors in situations where more bulky compounds, such as NVP-AUY922, may fail due to emerging resistance in Hsp90. Together with their significant activity against Hsp90, the structural data indicate that the thiadiazole inhibitors may represent a very useful class of Hsp90 inhibitor. Thiadiazoles Bind to Hsp90\u00a5\u00e2 and Inhibit Proliferation of HCT116 Human Colon Cells. The thiadiazoles compounds were evaluated for binding to full-length human Hsp90\u00a5\u00e2 and antiproliferative activity in cancer cells using the fluorescence polarization (FP) and the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, respectively (Table 2). Competitive binding as measured by FP across the 3 compounds ranged from 14.6 to 51.9 nM, which were consistent with the measured K d values (Fig. 1). The compounds exhibited antiproliferative activity (GI 50=3.2 to 4.6 \u00a5\u00ecM) against the HCT116 human colon cancer cell lines (Table 2). Thiadiazoles Elicit Depletion of Hsp90 Client Proteins, Induction of Heat Shock Proteins and Apoptosis. To confirm that growth inhibition was due to the intended Hsp90 inhibitory mechanism, the ICPD 26, 34 and 47 compounds were assessed for their effects on the established molecular signature of Hsp90 inhibition in the HCT116 cancer cells [38]. Depletion of client proteins CRAF, ERBB2 and CDK4, together with upregulation of Hsp72 and Hsp27 expression was observed, with a series of inhibitor concentrations, for the three compounds currently available, ICPD 26, 34 and 47, thus confirming that these compounds were acting as Hsp90 inhibitors in the cell (Fig. 4). An increase in PARP cleavage indicated induction of apoptosis. Discussion. The thiadiazoles studied here were previously shown to have significant affinity towards Hsp90, displaying K d values ranging from 4.8 and 39 nM [37]. Herein we have characterized the molecular interactions that these inhibitors make with the Hsp90\u00a5\u00e1 N-terminal ATP-binding domain and analyzed their effects on the human colon cancer cell line HCT116. The X-ray structures presented herein demonstrate that the thiadiazole compounds, although chemically simpler and less bulky, are none-the-less effective Hsp90 inhibitors. One of the inhibitors, ICPD 34, causes a structural change that affects a mobile loop, which adopts a conformation similar to that seen in complexes with ADP, rather than the conformation generally seen with the pyrazole/isoxazole-resorcinol class of inhibitors, such as NVP-AUY922. Importantly, we demonstrate that the thiadiazole inhibitors display a more limited core set of interactions relative to the clinical trial candidate NVP-AUY922, and consequently may be less susceptible to resistance derived through mutations in Hsp90. We have not tested this possibility directly, as it is difficult to predict precisely what mutations in Hsp90 might arise that would lead to resistance. However, the possibility of avoiding resistance combined with their antiproliferative and apopototic activity mediated through Hsp90 inhibition, makes the thiadiazole compounds an interesting and potentially useful class of Hsp90 inhibitors. Interestingly, a conformational change in the main-chain of the N-terminal domain was seen with ICPD 34, in order to accommodate the 3-methoxy group on the benzyl ring of this compound. It appears that the resulting conformation of the loop upon binding of ICPD 34 lowers the binding affinity as compared with ICPD 26 and ICPD 47, which lack the 3-methoxy group. The additional interactions this group makes do not compensate for the loss of the morpholino group, which for NVP-AUY922 is involved in a series of interactions that contribute to the increased potency of this compound [33]. The IC 50 values for binding of the clinical candidate NVP-AUY922 to Hsp90\u00a5\u00e1 and Hsp90\u00a5\u00e2, as measured by the FP competitive binding assay, were found to be 7.8\u00a1\u00be1.8 and 21\u00a1\u00be16 nM, respectively [33]. In comparison, the thiadiazoles displayed values ranging from 14.6 to 51.9 nM against Hsp90\u00a5\u00e2, results that are consistent with their somewhat weaker affinity for Hsp90 relative to NVP-AUY922. Furthermore, the GI 50 values for antiproliferative activity ranged between 3.2 to 4.6 \u00a5\u00ecM, which are much higher than the values for NVP-AUY922 (16.0\u00a1\u00be8.0 nM) against the HCT116 human colon cancer cell line [33]. The molecular signature of Hsp90 inhibition is the induction of the molecular chaperones Hsp72 and Hsp27 combined with the depletion of Hsp90 client-proteins. All three of the thiadiazole compounds tested displayed this signature of Hsp90 inhibition (Fig. 4) and they also induced PARP cleavage, suggesting that they induced apoptosis. The greater cellular potency of NVP-AUY922 against the thiadiazoles may be due to cell permeability issues and it is acknowledged that further optimization work is required to convert the high potency on the molecular target into greater potency against cancer cells. Such investment of effort can be justified by their potential to avoid emerging mechanisms of resistance due to mutations in the N-terminal ATP pocket. In conclusion, apart from the relative simplicity of their synthesis, the main potential advantage of the thiadiazole compounds studied here is the limited number of interactions that they make with highly conserved amino-acid residues representing the core of the N-terminal ATP-binding site of Hsp90. Consequently, they maybe less prone to resistance through mutation of this ATP-binding site. Whether these compounds could be developed further remains to be seen; however, this present study provides the structural basis and mechanistic framework to support further optimization. Materials and Methods. Hsp90 Inhibitors. The synthesis of the 5-aryl-4-(5-substituted-2-4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1,2,3-thiadiazoles was previously described [37]. The chemical structures of the compounds studied here are shown in Figure 1. Crystallization, Crystallographic Data Collection and Refinement. Crystals of human Hsp90\u00a5\u00e1 N-terminus were grown from a 1:1 mixture of protein (29 mg ml ?1) and precipitant solution (0.2 M MgCl2, 25% PEG 2 K and 100 mM sodium cocodylate pH 6.5) using the vapor diffusion crystallization method. The crystals were stepwise cryoprotected in 30% glycerol and flash frozen before data were collected at Diamond on beamline IO2. Data were processed in Mosflm and scaled and merged using SCALA [39]. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser using pdb code 2WI1 for compounds ICPD 26, and 47, and PDB code 1YC1 for ICPD 34 as the search model. The structures were refined using Phenix, with weight optimization, and manual building using COOT [40], [41], [42]. The inhibitors were built using the PRODRG 5 server. The ligand and waters were added towards the end of refinement. Structures were submitted to PUBSUM [43] for determination of molecular interactions between the protein and the drug molecules, in addition to visual inspection with PyMol [44]. The statistics for the crystallographic determinations are shown in Table 1 and the co-ordinates for the structures were deposited in the pdb database. The pdb accession numbers are 2YI0 (ICPD 26), 2YI5 (ICPD 34), and 2YI7 (ICPD47). Cell Lines. The human colon cancer cell line HCT116 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (LGC Promochem, Middlesex, UK). Cells were grown in DMEM/10% FCS, 2 mM glutamine and nonessential amino acids in 5% CO 2. HCT116 cells were free of Mycoplasma contamination (Venor GeM kit, Minerva Biolabs, Berlin, Germany). Production of Recombinant Proteins. The N-terminal domain of Hsp90\u00a5\u00e1 [45] and the full length Hsp90\u00a5\u00e2 proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as previously described [46], [47]. Western Blots. Protein extracts were prepared and Western blotting was performed as previously described [5], [31]. Fluorescence Polarization and Growth Inhibition Assay. Binding of HSP90 inhibitors to human full-length HSP90\u00a5\u00e2 was determined by a competitive binding fluorescence polarization assay, using a fluorescent isoxazole- resorcinol probe, as described previously [48]. Briefly, compounds were assayed in a 96-well plate format to determine IC 50 values. Reaction mix (100 \u00a5\u00ecl; 100 mM Tris.Cl, pH 7.4, 20 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 5 \u00a5\u00ecg ml ?1 bovine serum albumin, 80 nM isoxazole probe, 100 nM Hsp90\u00a5\u00e2) was added per well of a black 96-well plate (Corning Costar No. 3915) and allowed to equilibrate for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. Plates were read on a Fusion Alpha-FP (Perkin?Elmer, USA) with excitation 485/20 nM and emission 535/25 nM with polarization. Compounds at a range of concentration were then added to the reaction, mixed thoroughly, and allowed to equilibrate again at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. IC50 values were calculated on the difference in anisotropy from the first and second reads. Sensitivity of cells to Hsp90 inhibitors was measured by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay [5]. Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to attach for 36 hours. Compounds at a range of concentrations were added in quadruplicate wells for 4 days in a volume of 200 \u00a5\u00ecl per well. The GI 50 was calculated as the drug concentration that inhibits cell proliferation by 50% compared with vehicle controls. Funding Statement.

                "text": "Killing of Kras mutant colon cancer cells via Rac-independent actin remodeling by the \u00a5\u00e2GBP cytokine a physiological PI3K inhibitor therapeutically effective in vivo\tActivating mutations in Kras are the most frequent mutations in human cancer. They define a subset of patients who do not respond to current therapies and for whom prognosis is poor. Oncogenic Kras has been shown to deregulate numerous signalling pathways of which the most intensively studied are the Ras-ERK cascade and the PI3K-Akt cascade. However, to date there are no effective targeted therapies in the clinic against Kras-mutant cancers. Here we report that the \u00a5\u00e2GBP cytokine, a physiological inhibitor of class I PI3Ks is a potent activator of apoptosis in Kras-mutant colorectal cancer cells, even when co-harboring mutant-activated PIK3CA. Our study unveils an elective route to intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis which involves the cytoskeleton. Early events are inhibition of PI3K activity and Rac-independent actin rearrangement assignable to phosphoinositide changes at the plasma membrane. Cyclin E deregulation, arrest of DNA synthesis and Chk2 activation underscore events critical to the activation of an intrinsic apoptotic program. Clustering of CD95/Fas death receptors underscore events critical to the activation of extrinsic apoptosis. In nude mice we present the first evidence that xenograft tumor development is strongly inhibited by Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP. Taken together our results open a new therapeutic opportunity against a subset of patients refractive to current treatments. This first demonstration of therapeutic efficacy against Kras-mutant colon cancer suggests that Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP may also be therapeutically effective against other cancers harbouring activating Ras mutations as well as PIK3CA mutations. Introduction. Activating mutations in the Ras genes (H,K,N) (1), the most common oncogenic mutations in human cancers, are dominant determinants of drug resistance. Most frequent in Kras, Kras mutations define tumors refractory to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy (2, 3) and to more recently introduced therapies based on EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (4-7). Locked in the GTP-bound mode, oncogenic Ras constitutively activates the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade and an integrated signaling network which controls cell proliferation and cell survival (8, 9) to be a major mediator of tumorigenesis. The importance of activating mutations in the Ras oncogenes in human cancers has made Ras and downstream effectors elective targets for therapeutic intervention but the value of targeting inhibitors in the clinic remains doubtful. For example, prevention of Ras anchorage at the cell membrane by farnesyltransferase inhibitors has been shown to be effective in mice expressing oncogenic Ras but not in patients with solid tumors (10). Similarly, in more recent studies CI-1040, a MEK inhibitor, was found to induce significant shrinkage of Kras-driven lung carcinomas in mice (11) but to have no significant effect in patients with advanced lung, breast, colon and pancreatic cancers (12). Using a different approach a number of compounds with efficacy against cells with mutant-activated Kras have been identified by high-throughput screening (13-16) and shown to inhibit xenograft growth (13,15,16), however the mechanisms by which these compounds operate are not fully understood and their anti-cancer efficacy in the clinic remains uncertain. Recently, the necessary role played by the PI3K/Akt pathway in maintaining tumor growth has made this pathway a target for small molecule inhibitors of the PI3K cascade (17-21). However, the efficacy of these inhibitors as single agents in Kras-driven oncogenesis is disputable. For example, in mice that had developed lung tumors in response to Kras activation, no significant tumor regression was found upon treatment with a dual pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor which had instead shown efficacy in lung tumors driven by the expression of activated PI3K (22). In other experiments, the efficacy of the PI3K inhibitor PX-866 was significantly less in xenografts bearing Kras and PIK3CA mutations than in those having PIK3CA mutations alone (23). On the other hand Kras-mutant lung tumors did regress when the pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor was used in combination with a MEK inhibitor (22). Similarly, in cells expressing Kras or Hras mutants, resistance to PI3K inhibitors could be reversed by inhibitors of the Ras-ERK pathway (24). Despite these positive results, it remains to be established whether in the human system Kras oncogenicity could be overcome by the combined targeting of the PI3K and the Ras pathways and be beneficial as, in addition to toxicity, a disadvantage of this approach is that these pathways are also required for the proliferation of normal cells and for the maintenance of their homeostatic balance. In previous studies we have shown that monomeric \u00a5\u00e2-galactoside binding protein (\u00a5\u00e2GBP), an antiproliferative cytokine (25) which in normal cells participates in the negative regulation of the cell cycle (26) operates through mechanisms which involve high affinity receptor binding (Kd~1.5\u00a1\u00bf10 ?10M) (26) and molecular interactions leading to downregulation of class IA and class IB PI3Ks (27). Inhibition of PI3K activity by Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP was found to have two major outcomes: suppression of Ras-GTP loading leading to block of ERK activation (27), and negation of akt gene expression leading to loss of Akt (21), conditions that either by blocking the ability of cancer cells to proliferate or by impairing their ability to survive can block oncogenicity, thus highlighting a selective anti-cancer effect as in normal cells \u00a5\u00e2GBP enforced cell cycle restriction is reversible (26). We now report that in colorectal carcinoma cells bearing oncogenic Kras downregulation of PI3K activity by Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP at doses that did not inhibit canonical signaling downstream of Ras or PI3K promoted events critical to the activation of an intrinsic and an extrinsic cell death program initiating with Rac-independent actin reorganization assignable to phosphoinositide changes at the plasma membrane. We also report that Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP had therapeutic efficacy in vivo and that the added presence of activating mutations in PIK3CA did not confer resistance to treatment with Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP.

PI3K assay. Step by step description of the method for assessment of PI3K activity has been reported previously (21). In brief, the immmunoprecipitated class I enzyme complex (27) was incubated in a kinase reaction for 3 hours with 40pmol phosphatidylinositol (4,5) biphosphate substrate and the phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate generated assayed in a competitive ELISA (Echelon Biosciences). Differences were tested using Student\u00a1\u00afs t test and p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Western blotting. ERK2 phosphorylation was visualized by mobility shift using anti-p42 polyclonal anitibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Phosphorylated Akt was detected by anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and total Akt1/2 protein probed with anti-Akt1/2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). E2F1 was detected using anti-E2F1 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and phosphorylated Chk2 detected with anti-phospho-Chk2 (Thr 68) polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare) were used for visualisation by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Blots were reprobed with anti-GAPDH antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with monoclonal anti-\u00a5\u00e2?actin (Sigma). Active Rac1 levels were assessed by affinity precipitation using PAK1 p21 binding domain agarose (Millipore) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions, followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling) and Odyssey fluorescent secondary antibodies. Total Rac was assessed using the same antibodies. Fluorimetric quantitation of cyclin E. Cells fixed in cold 70% ethanol were treated with FITC-labelled monoclonal anti-cyclin E antibody (Becton Dickinson), washed, stained with propidium iodide containing RNase (Sigma) and analysed using an LSRII (Becton Dickinson). FITC fluorescence was collected using a 530/30 filter and propidium iodide fluorescencece using a 610/20 filter. At least 20,000 events were recorded. DNA synthesis. Cells incubated with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Sigma) for 30 minutes were fixed in cold 70% ethanol and stained for BrdU uptake using a monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (Becton Dickinson), followed by an FITC-labelled monoclonal goat anti-mouse antibody (Dako). DNA was counterstained with propidium iodide (Sigma) containing RNase (Sigma). Samples were analysed using an LSRII (Becton Dickinson) and FITC fluorescence collected using a 530/30 filter and propidium iodide fluorescence using a 610/20 filter. At least 20,000 events were recorded. Microscopy. Cells on coverslips fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/0.2%gluteraldehyde solution were stained with Texas Red phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for F-actin detection. For tubulin detection cells were treated with a monoclonal anti \u00a5\u00e1-tubulin antibody (Sigma) followed by anti-mouse secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). DNA was stained with DAPI (Sigma). Imaging was carried out using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal system. Analysis of the F-actin labeled regions was performed in an automated manner using journals in MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging) and statistical significance tested by ANOVA (29). For CD95/Fas and FasL imaging with a Zeiss Axiophot microcope, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated with a monoclonal antibody to CD95/Fas (Abcam) followed by FITC-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (Cappel) and rabbit polyclonal FasL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by Texas Red-conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Time-lapse imaging by Differential Interference Contrast microscopy was used to monitor peripheral dynamics at the plasma membrane edge. Recordings on sets of 150 cells from three randomly selected fields from double experiments were analysed and graded on a 0 to 3 arbitrary scale by two independent observers and statistical significance determined by \u00a5\u00f6 2 test. Tumor growth in mice. Thymectomized female nude CD-1mice (Charles River Laboratory) were implanted subcutaneously in the right flank with 5\u00a1\u00bf10 6 SW620 cells in 150 \u00a5\u00ecl PBS. Control mice received an equal volume of PBS. Mice were ear marked and randomised in groups of seven and treatment with Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP dissolved in PBS started at a tumor volume of ~40 mm 3. Treatment was performed by subcutaneous injection of 150\u00a5\u00ecl in the tumor area for six consecutive days with one day interval, up to 35 days. Control mice received an equal volume of PBS. Experiments were carried out in accordance with the UK Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research guidelines and approved by the local responsible authorities. Results. Arrest of cell replication and apoptosis are preceded by cytoskeletal rearrangement. We tested Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP against SW480 and SW620 colorectal cancer cells, of primary and metastatic derivation, both harboring Kras G12V and against LoVo cells, also of metastatic origin, which harbor Kras G13D (COSMIC database). We found that treatment with Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP at concentrations of 2-4 nM, some tenfold lower than those required for other cancer cells (21, 30) resulted in growth arrest and accumulation of cells in S phase, a state reversible in normal cells (26) but followed in the cells of this study by total cell loss attributable to the activation of an apoptotic program documented by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, functional alteration of the plasma membrane and caspase 3 activation (Fig. 1A and 1B). We next investigated whether as in other cell contexts (21, 27) PI3K was a responder to the action of Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP. As cell phosphoinositide levels do not directly represent the functional state of the PI3K enzymes, but are the result of PI3K and PTEN activity, to estimate PI3K activity we isolated the PI3K enzyme complex (27) by immunoprecipitation and assessed its ability to convert phosphatidylinositol (4,5) biphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate (PIP3) in a kinase reaction by measuring the generated PIP3 in a competitive ELISA (21). PIP3 quantitation (Fig. 2A) shows that downregulation of PI3K activity was a prime event, though delayed in the LoVo cells. However, contrary to previous evidence from other cell types (21, 27) we found no indication, after PI3K inhibition, of loss of ERK or Akt function whose phosphorylation state in the cells programmed to death was instead increased (Fig. 2B), a response conceivably similar to that seen in human cancer cells where inhibition of mTORC1 by a rapamycin derivative resulted in increase ERK and Akt activity via a feedback loop (31). We discovered instead that the treated cells had undergone a profound change of shape characterized by F-actin rearrangement, spreading of the microtubular network and an enlargement of the cell spread area whose changes in time were quantitated in terms of F-actin spatial distribution (Fig. 2C and 2D), changes that can block cancer cell motility and invasion (32) but in our case followed by apoptosis (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether actin remodeling related to changes in Rac activity, a key regulator of actin dynamics, we assessed active Rac1 levels by immunoblot analysis and examined protrusive activity at the membrane edge, a Rac mediated process (33), by time-lapse imaging within the 24 hours time span leading to cytoskeletal changes. We found that in the cells where PI3K activity had been inhibited, Rac1 levels remained unchanged and edge membrane activity was not affected by treatment with Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP, nor by treatment with wortmannin (10\u00a5\u00ecM) a pharmacological p110 inhibitor. These results, consistent with the finding that edge ruffling induced by constitutively active Rac is not blocked upon PI3K inhibition (34), suggest that in cells harboring oncogenic Ras, Rac activation is maintained through Ras mediated signaling in a PI3K independent manner (35). Cyclin E stabilization and arrest of DNA synthesis results in Chk2 activation. To determine which biochemical events consequent to PI3K inhibition and cytoskeletal changes might play a part in cell cycle arrest and in the activation of an apoptotic program, we examined parameters involved in cell growth restriction. Following immunoblot analysis, which in the arrested cells revealed no changes in cyclin D1 but raised and persistent levels of cyclin E and a gradual, and expected, decline of cyclin A levels, we quantitated cyclin E by cytofluorometry and found that while decreasing in the replicating cells, in the arrested cells cyclin E levels remained ectopically high with resulting relative values greater than those of controls by about 60-90 percent at the highest point (Fig. 3A). As ectopic expression of cyclin E can cause impairment of DNA replication due to defects in replication initiation (36), we investigated whether in the arrested cells DNA synthesis had been inhibited. We found that by day 2 of treatment DNA synthesis had come to a halt (Fig. 3B). Since processes that interfere with DNA synthesis may result in the activation of DNA damage checkpoints and death by apoptosis (37), we turned our attention to the downstream kinase effectors of the DNA damage response pathways (37-39). Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) was not detectable but we found that checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) which is required for responses to DNA damage and replication block (37, 39) had been activated (Fig. 3C). This is of relevance as Chk2 can phosphorylate E2F-1 regulating its stability and transcriptional activity (38, 40) and be a cause of apoptotic induction in cells where, in contrast to normal cells, E2F-1 is overexpressed (41, 42), as can be seen when comparing epithelial cells from the normal colon mucosa and the colon cancer cells of this investigation (Fig. 3 D and 3E). Involvement of death receptors. Further to the rearrangement of cytoskeletal architecture (Fig. 2B) it is conceivable that rearrangement in the organization of subcortical actin may affect macromolecular mobility within the plane of the plasma membrane. We therefore investigated whether treatment with Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP would affect the distribution pattern of the CD95/Fas death receptor which, as well as other death receptors (28), is a mediator of apoptosis, and examined whether the distribution pattern of Fas L would change accordingly. The evidence collected (Fig. 4) shows that as suggested by their co-location, CD95/Fas-Fas L clustering, a prime condition for the activation of an extrinsic apoptotic program, was detectable in each cell line. Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP has efficacy in vivo. Next we tested whether the therapeutic efficacy observed in vitro could be reproduced in an in vivo model. We implanted subcutaneously SW620 metastatic cells in nude mice and initiated treatment at a tumor volume of ~40 mm 3 administering Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP at doses conforming to the nM dosages (Fig. 5 legend) used in the current and in previous in vitro experiments (21, 27, 30). Comparison of growth curves (Fig. 5A) shows that a five week period of treatment had inhibited xenograft growth by ~70%, with none of the treated mice appearing unhealthy as assessed by observation of behaviour and body weight measurements. On further observation once the treatment had been stopped, we followed individually surviving mice bearing small tumors (~100-200mm 3) (Fig. 5B) and compared the rate of tumor growth resumption with the growth rate of control xenografts from an average volume of ~100 mm 3 hence. Histograms show that resumption of tumor development proceeded at a slower rate and that in only two instances within a nine week period xenograft size had approached the size attained in three weeks by the xenografts of the control mice (Fig. 5C). Mutant PIK3CA does not confer resistance to Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP. In addition to oncogenic Kras, whose frequency in human colorectal cancer is about 40%, activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene, also frequent in colorectal cancer (43), can induce oncogenicity (44) and tumor invasion (45). To investigate whether Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP would be therapeutically effective in colorectal cancer cells bearing both mutations we examined HCT116 and DLD1 both mutated at Kras-G13D (13) in which either the mutant or the wild-type PIK3CA allele had been deleted by homologous recombination in order to express one of two major hot spot mutations (44). In a tightly controlled experiment we examined HCT116 G13D cells harboring an H1047R alteration in exon 20 (kinase domain) and DLD1 G13D cells which have an E545K alteration in exon 9 (helical domain) paired with their isogenic wild-type counterparts. Our results show that compared to the wild type the growth rate of cells harboring mutant PIK3CA was increased and apoptosis was delayed by one day (DLD1mut) (Fig. 6A and 6B), but the response to Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP was fundamentally similar in all cells whether PIK3CA wild type or mutant and similar to the response of the colorectal carcinoma cells of Figure 1 which are exempt of PIK3CA mutations. Inhibition of PI3K activity was followed by inhibition of cell proliferation and cell death assignable to the activation of an apoptotic program. Discussion. Mutant-activated Kras defines a subset of patients with poor prognosis. We show that the PI3K inhibitor used in this study was remarkably efficacious. Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP as a single agent induced apoptotic death in cancer cells harboring mutant-activated Kras, even when co-expressing an activating mutation in PIK3CA, and was therapeutically effective in vivo. Unlike molecules designed to target critical hubs within signaling pathways, the \u00a5\u00e2GBP molecule operates through mechanisms which involve high affinity receptor binding (26) and molecular interactions leading to functional inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit of class IA and class IB PI3Ks with consequent loss of ERK (27) and Akt function (21). Surprisingly, in the cancer cells of this study inhibition of PI3K activity was not characterized by loss of active ERK or active Akt, key prognostic therapeutic markers to \u00a5\u00e2GBP response (46), whose phosphorylation state was instead increased, but characterized by actin reorganization in a Rac-independent manner. While our data provide no indication that changes in actin organization related to loss of Rac activity, the fact that phosphoinositides and PIP2 in particular have an important role in the binding and control of actin regulatory proteins (47) lends ground to infer that changes in PIP2 levels, turnover or spatial distribution brought about by molecular interactions involved in \u00a5\u00e2GBP receptor-PI3K communication (27) may affect plasma membrane-cytoskeletal linkages and have a causative role in the activation of two distinct sets of events critical to the initiation of an apoptotic program. One, relating to a general rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, consequent cell cycle checkpoint restrictions and the ectopic accumulation of cyclin E whose bearing on the impairment of DNA replication provides a potential for errors in DNA repair and for the activation of an intrinsic apoptotic process. The other set of events relates, conceivably, to changes in cortical actin organization, increased macromolecular mobility within the plane of the plasma membrane and clustering of death receptors, a critical condition for the activation of an extrinsic apoptotic process. Two other aspects of our study deserve mention. One pertains to the importance that activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene have in conferring advantages which facilitate cell growth and invasion (44). Our data (Fig. 6) provide strong evidence that in colorectal carcinoma cells harboring mutated PIK3CA further to oncogenic Kras, inhibition of PI3K activity was followed by the activation of a cell death program, underscoring that as single agent Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP had full therapeutic efficacy where combination targeting of PI3K and of Ras downstream effectors might instead be required (22, 24). The other key aspect relates to the ability of Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP to strongly reduce tumor growth and to convert tumors that had survived a five week period of treatment from a faster to a slow developing (Fig. 5B and 5C) and, conceivably, a more benign tumor phenotype. Based on a model discussed in a previous report (21) this result may be interpreted as proof-of-principle-evidence that cancer vulnerability in response to Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP challenge is greater in the aggressive cancer phenotype, as a contained tumor growth after end of treatment is suggestion of clonal selection through elimination of the more aggressive cells. Recently, a number of compounds identified by high-throughput screening have been reported to have therapeutic efficacy against Kras-mutant cancer cells (13-16), however, amongst all candidate agents for the therapy of cancers harboring mutant-activated Ras, the \u00a5\u00e2GBP molecule, a cytokine, by virtue of its physiological nature is the only one, to our knowledge, which in the clinic would be implicitly exempt from drug toxicity and drug resistance. As, further to colorectal carcinoma, mutations in the Ras oncogenes and in genes involved in PI3K regulation extend to other cancers, our results suggest that Hu-r-\u00a5\u00e2GBP is, potentially, a therapeutic agent that could provide benefit to a large number of patients.

                "text": "A novel ligand delivery system to non-invasively visualize and therapeutically exploit the IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 tumor-restricted biomarker\tOur objective was to exploit a novel ligand-based delivery system for targeting diagnostic and therapeutic agents to cancers that express interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13R\u00a5\u00e12), a tumor-restricted plasma membrane receptor overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), meningiomas, peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and other peripheral tumors. On the basis of our prior work, we designed a novel IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-targeted quadruple mutant of IL13 (TQM13) to selectively bind the tumor-restricted IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 with high affinity but not significantly interact with the physiologically abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 heterodimer that is also expressed in normal brain. We then assessed the in vitro binding profile of TQM13 and its potential to deliver diagnostic and therapeutic radioactivity in vivo. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR; Biacore) binding experiments demonstrated that TQM13 bound strongly to recombinant IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 (K d\u00a1\u00ad5 nM). In addition, radiolabeled TQM13 specifically bound IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing GBM cells and specimens but not normal brain. Of importance, TQM13 did not functionally activate IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 in cells or bind to it in SPR binding assays, in contrast to wtIL13. Furthermore, in vivo targeting of systemically delivered radiolabeled TQM13 to IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing subcutaneous tumors was demonstrated and confirmed non-invasively for the first time with 124I-TQM13 positron emission tomography imaging. In addition, 131I-TQM13 demonstrated in vivo efficacy against subcutaneous IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing GBM tumors and in an orthotopic synergeic IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-positive murine glioma model, as evidenced by statistically significant survival advantage. Our results demonstrate that we have successfully generated an optimized biomarker-targeted scaffolding that exhibited specific binding activity toward the tumor-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 in vitro and potential to deliver diagnostic and therapeutic payloads in vivo. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an invariably fatal malignancy with a mean survival time of approximately 14 months despite the availability of multimodality treatments, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. 1 The residual and infiltrating cells left after therapies, such as surgery and radiation, lead to recurrent disease in the resection cavity and beyond. Molecular-targeted therapies that target tumor-associated biomarkers have emerged as innovative approaches to eradicate these highly infiltrative tumors but not harm normal brain. Similarly, molecular targeted therapies offer promise in systemic malignancies that also express tumor-restricted biomarkers. Interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13R\u00a5\u00e12) is an attractive GBM-associated biomarker that we and others have previously identified to be overexpressed in approximately 75% of GBMs but not in normal brain tissue or significantly on other organ sites except the testes. 2? 5 In addition to GBMs, IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 has been reported to be overexpressed in peripheral nerve sheath tumors, medulloblastomas, and meningiomas. 6? 9 This receptor is thought to serve as a protective decoy receptor that has recently been shown to sequester IL13 and prevent it from inducing apoptosis through the physiologically abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 heterodimer in GBM. 10 IL13R\u00a5\u00e11 is a distinct physiologically abundant receptor that weakly binds IL13 and needs to recruit IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 for a high-affinity IL13 interaction requisite to mediate the common physiological functions of IL13. 11 The differential expression of IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 in cancer has led many groups to develop means of targeting this attractive biomarker with diagnostic and therapeutic agents. One approach to targeting IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 has been to use derivatives of IL13, the high-affinity natural ligand for IL13R\u00a5\u00e12. 12, 13 However, because IL13 also interacts with the physiologically abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 heterodimer expressed in normal brain, 3 we rationally designed our derivative ligands to overcome this interaction with the non-cancer associated receptor. This selectivity is possibly attributable to our prior work in which we extensively used site-directed mutagenesis to identify specific amino acids on IL13 that are responsible for its binding toward the physiologically abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 heterodimer and the cancer-restricted IL13R\u00a5\u00e12. We found that specific mutations introduced to amino acids at the 13 th, 66 th, and 69 th positions on IL13 decreased the binding/activation of the physiologically abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 receptor (Fig.?1). 14, 15 Of importance, these mutations that impair binding to the physiologically abundant IL13 receptor have no adverse effect on the strong binding to the tumor-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12. 14, 15 In addition, we found that a mutation in a separate region of IL13, a lysine-to-arginine mutation at the 105 th position in the D-helix, enhanced IL13 affinity toward the cancer-restricted receptor IL13R\u00a5\u00e12. 16, 17 Therefore, to further improve targeting the tumor-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12, we for the first time combined all 4 IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-targeting mutations to produce an optimized targeted quadruple mutant of IL13 (TQM13; IL13.E13K/R66D/S69D/K105R), a multiply mutated IL13 derivative that we hypothesized would demonstrate enhanced binding to the tumor-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 but not to the physiologically abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 heterodimer (Fig.?1). In addition, on the basis of our prior work, we produced a matched negative control (IL13R-binding deficient mutant of IL13, BDef13; IL13.E13K/R66D/S69D/K105A) that only differs from TQM13 by a single amino acid substitution, but lacks appreciable binding to both IL13 receptors (Fig.?1). 16, 17 In addition to demonstrating in vitro and in vivo tumor targeting of our optimized ligand, we used a mutant derivative of IL13 (TQM13) to non-invasively image real-time biomarker IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 expression via positron emission tomography (PET) and to selectively deliver toxic \u00a5\u00e2-emitting radioactivity to IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing malignancy. This, for the first time, manifests the potential of using noninvasive imaging to assess real-time IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 expression for the purpose of personalizing our targeted therapy against malignancies that express this attractive tumor-associated biomarker.

IODO-GEN reagents for 125I, 124I, and 131I labeling were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Construction of Plasmids and Expression/Purification of Recombinant Proteins. For TQM13 and BDef13 plasmid construction, the plasmid for IL13.E13K.R66D.S69D (obtained from W.D. 21) was further mutagenized at the 105 th position as we previously described. 16, 17 TQM13 cDNA was amplified and inserted into the directional pET100 TOPO vector as instructed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen), which contained an N-terminus polyhistidine tag. All plasmids carrying the gene constructs of interest were under a T7 promoter-based expression system and constructed as described. 14 Plasmids were isolated using Qiagen kits and sequenced in-house to verify the correct mutations prior to use. Protein synthesis in Escherichia coli and purification were performed as previously described. 15, 17 The inclusion body fraction of the bacterial cells was isolated using the detergent-based BugBuster protein extraction reagents according to the manufacturer's recommendations (EMD Chemicals). Denatured recombinant proteins were purified via nickel-based affinity chromatography (Qiagen), then renatured using the disulfide-shuffling method as described elsewhere. 22 wtIL13 and IL13.E13K recombinant proteins were obtained from W.D. and were expressed/purified in a prokaryotic system as previously described. 14, 15 Western Blot. Western blotting was done as described previously. 15 Membranes were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C and with secondary antibody conjugated with HRP for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was done using the enhanced chemiluminescence plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare) with the LAS-3000 imaging system (Fujifilm), and images were compiled using Adobe Photoshop Elements, version 5.0 (Adobe Systems). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were made with a Jasco-720 spectropolarimeter. All measurements were performed at 23\u00a1\u00c6C, using a .05 cm path-length quartz cuvette. Proteins (0.2 mg/mL) were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then analyzed. Reported spectra were the average of 3 consecutive runs for each sample. Spectra from PBS alone were subtracted from each sample so that the resulting spectra reflected only the CD contribution of the proteins. Cytotoxicity Assay. Cytotoxicity assays were performed as described previously. In brief, 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 3 G26-hIL13R\u00a5\u00e12(+) cells were plated on each well of a 96-well plate in 150 \u00a5\u00ecL of media and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, 25 \u00a5\u00ecL of blocker (8 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL; eg, IL13 derivatives in 0.1% BSA/PBS buffer or buffer alone) was added. After an hour of incubation at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, 25 \u00a5\u00ecL of varying concentrations of IL13-based bacterial cytotoxin was added in quadruplicate and incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in 5% CO 2/95% O 2 for 48 h. After 48 h, the MTS/PMS cell proliferation assay was performed as instructed by the manufacturer (Promega). Ten microliters of dye was added to each well and incubated for 2?4 h. Plates were then read using a microplate reader at an absorbance of 490 nm. Cyclohexamide-treated, cell-containing wells served as the background for the assay. Background was subtracted from each data point, which was divided by the value from the wells that were not treated with cytotoxin to obtain the fraction of cells remaining. The fraction of cells remaining was multiplied by 100 to obtain the percent of control. IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-Binding Biacore Experiment. Measurements were performed in a Biacore T100 instrument by monitoring the changes in response units (RU) at the biosensor surface. 23 Recombinant hIL13R\u00a5\u00e12-Fc (R&D Systems) in sodium acetate (pH 4; Biacore AB) was coupled to the carboxymethyl dextran layer of a CM5 research-grade chip using standard amine-coupling procedures, expecting to achieve a surface density of 10 000?12 000 RUs in the sample channel; excess ethanolamine then blocked any remaining reactive groups in both the sample and reference channels. 24 The running buffer used in this study was HBS-EP 1X (Biacore AB). Purified TQM13 and BDef13 were separately injected in series (0, 100, 300, and 1000 nM) over the immobilized receptor, followed by a regeneration cycle with 0.1% SDS. The biosensor was equilibrated for 300 s with buffer prior to the next cycle. Binding was quantified as the increase in RUs (sample minus reference channel signals) at 60 s after the end of injection, compared with a baseline established at 20 s prior to injection. Kinetic data were analyzed with a bivalent analyte model to determine the forward and reverse rate constants for complex formation between TQM13 (or BDef13) and immobilized IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-Fc. This approach yielded a 20-fold reduction in \u00a5\u00f6 2, compared with a single-site kinetic model. Therefore, the dissociation constant K d was calculated from the ratio k off/k on for the initial binding step, as previously described. 23 IL13R\u00a5\u00e11-Dependent TF-1 Cell Proliferation Assay. TF-1 cells (pre-leukemic human B cells, which express the shared IL13/4 receptor) 25 were grown in the presence of different concentrations of wtIL13 or its mutants in 96-well culture plates. After 72 h of incubation at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, the rate of proliferation of the TF-1 cells was determined by a colorimetric MTS/PMS cell proliferation assay as instructed by the manufacturer (Promega). Cyclohexamide-treated, cell-containing wells served as the background for the assay. Background was subtracted from each data point, which was divided by the value from the wells that were not treated with cytokines to obtain the proliferation rate, expressed as percentage of controls. 16 In the competitive assay, TF-1 cells were pretreated with TQM13 for 2 h prior to the addition of wtIL13 for growth. IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1-Binding Biacore Experiment. This study was performed similarly to the IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-binding Biacore experiment. Recombinant hIL4R\u00a5\u00e1-Fc (R&D Systems) was immobilized instead. wtIL13, IL13.E13K, and TQM13 were pre-incubated with or without recombinant human IL13R\u00a5\u00e11-Fc (R&D Systems) in equal molar concentrations for 1 h at 37\u00a1\u00c6C to reconstitute the binding complex prior to delivery to the immobilized IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 binding partner. Binding signal for each experimental ligand complex was expressed as a percentage of the positive control (wtIL13 + IL13R\u00a5\u00e11). Iodination and Instant Thin-Layer Chromatography. Recombinant IL13 derivatives were labeled with 125I (or 124I, 131I) using the IODO-GEN method as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). Instant thin-layer chromatography was performed using 0.9% saline as the mobile phase to ensure labeling efficiency. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay. Radiolabeled 125I-TQM13 and 125I-BDef13 were incubated with excess molar amounts of soluble recombinant hIL13R\u00a5\u00e12.Fc (R&D Systems) at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 1 h with constant gentle mixing. Sample preparation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were then performed using the NativePAGE gel system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Digital detection was done using a storage phosphor screen with the Typhoon Trio (GE Healthcare), and images were compiled using Adobe Photoshop Elements, version 5.0 (Adobe Systems). Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry detecting IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 expression was performed as previously described. 26 Photomicrographs were taken with a 40x magnification lens with a Retiga 4000 camera using ImagePro Plus, version 5.1. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop Elements, version 5.0 (Adobe Systems). Autoradiography. Autoradiography was performed as previously described 4 on snap-frozen G48a subcutaneous tumor sections or clinical GBM specimens obtained from the Wake Forest University Brain Tumor Center of Excellence depository. Digital detection was done using a storage phosphor screen with the Typhoon Trio (GE Healthcare), and images were compiled using Adobe Photoshop Elements, version 5.0 (Adobe Systems). All clinical tissue sections were scored independently by 2 reviewers on the basis of the overall specific signal intensity throughout the section and assigned a score (0, none; 1, low; 2, moderate; or 3, strong). Receptor Binding Study on Tumor Cells. G48a cells were plated at 8 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 cells per well in 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. For saturation curve binding analysis, cells were incubated in 300 \u00a5\u00ecL of growth medium in duplicates containing 0.1?20 nM concentrations of 125I-TQM13 (specific activity 233 cpm/fmol) for 2 h at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. Cells were then washed gently 3 times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in 500 \u00a5\u00ecL of 0.1% NaOH. Lysate was harvested into scintillation vials; scintillation cocktail was added, and its activity was counted using a Beckman Coulter LS6000SC scintillation counter. Non-specific binding was determined at each concentration of labeled TQM13 by adding 500-fold molar excess of the non-labeled TQM13. Non-specific binding was subtracted from all the data points to produce specific binding values. The results represent an average of duplicate determinations in 1?3 independent assays with variations being <20% from the mean. Saturation binding studies were performed similarly with U-251 and B16 tumor cells. In competition studies, 8 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 G48a cells were incubated with serial dilutions of TQM13 at 4\u00a1\u00c6C for 1 h. Next, labeled TQM13 was added at a final concentration of 0.5 nM and incubated with cells for an additional 2h. Then, the cell-bound radioactivity was determined as above. 16 Binding data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software and receptor number estimated by GraphPad radioactivity calculator (GraphPad Software). In Vivo Biodistribution Experiment. Actively growing G48a cells were implanted subcutaneously into male athymic nude (nu/nu) mice at 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 7 cells per mouse in 200 \u00a5\u00ecL of PBS/Matrigel (BD Biosciences), as recommended by the manufacturer. When tumors reached 500 mm 3, mice were injected intravenously with 100 \u00a5\u00ecCi 125I-TQM13 (n = 6) or BDef13 (n = 2) and killed 24h after injection. Muscle and tumor tissues were harvested, weighed, snap-frozen, and counted in a \u00a5\u00e3-counter. Counts per wet weight were calculated for each tissue sample, and the tumor-to-muscle ratio was obtained. PET Experiment. Luciferase-expressing G48a GBM subcutaneous tumors were initiated in the front and hind flanks of male athymic nude (nu/nu) mice as described in the biodistribution study (2 tumors per mouse). When tumors reached 500 mm 3, mice were injected intraperitoneally with luciferin-D (50 mg/kg) and imaged using the IVIS-100 Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences) for tumor confirmation prior to PET imaging study. Mice were then injected intravenously with 100 \u00a5\u00ecCi 124I-TQM13 (n = 2) or BDef13 (n = 2) and imaged at 2, 4, 24, and 48h after injection with use of a microPET P4 scanner (Siemens/CTI Concorde). Before and during the 20-min scans, all mice were anesthetized and maintained by 1.5?2.5% isoflurane. PET images were analyzed by defined region of interest (ROI) using AMIDE software (Stanford School of Medicine). In Vivo Antitumor Experiment. G48a GBM cells were implanted subcutaneously into male athymic nude (nu/nu) as described in the biodistribution experiment. The treatment started when established tumors were formed. Radiolabeled 131I-TQM13 (200 \u00a5\u00ecCi/mouse) or controls (unlabeled TQM13, 131I-labeled control or saline mock injection) were injected intratumorally and repeated 7 days after the initial treatment (n = 5 per group). Tumor measurements were obtained weekly using a digital caliper. When tumors reached a volume exceeding 1000 mm 3, mice were killed, and their tumors were removed then snap frozen. Orthotopic IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing GBM tumors were established by stereotaxic implantation of 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 actively growing G26-H2 murine glioma cells in C57BL/6 mice. In brief, mice were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture (114/17 mg/kg), and a 0.45 mm burr hole was made 2 mm lateral and 0.5 posterior to the bregma in the right cerebral hemisphere through a scalp incision. Stereotaxic injection was performed on a Just For Mice stereotaxic apparatus (Harvard Apparatus) using a 10-\u00a5\u00ecL syringe (Hamilton) with a 30-gauge, 1-inch flat needle, inserted through the burr hole to a depth of 3.2 mm, and constant infusion at a rate of 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecL/min to a total volume of 5 \u00a5\u00ecL was delivered by a Nanomite Programmable Syringe Pump (Harvard Apparatus). 27, 28 Five days after implantation, mice were imaged using the IVIS-100 Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences) as described in the PET experiment to confirm tumor establishment. Animals with confirmed intracranial tumors via luminescent signal were randomly stratified to treatment and control groups. They were then administered 2 treatments of radiolabeled 131I-TQM13 (n = 8), radioactivity control (n = 5) or mock injection with saline (n = 7) at day 10 (90 \u00a5\u00ecCi/mouse) and day 20 (142 \u00a5\u00ecCi/mouse) after tumor implantation. During these treatments, mice were again anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine, and therapeutic agents or controls were administered via the same burr hole made for tumor implantation. To mimic convection-enhanced delivery, drugs were infused at a constant rate of 0.7 \u00a5\u00ecL/min by positive pressure from a Nanomite Programmable Syringe Pump (Harvard Apparatus). Animals losing \u00a1\u00c320% of their body weight or having trouble ambulating or feeding were euthanized. Mice with tumors growing outside of their intracranial space were eliminated from the study. Statistical Analyses. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Error bars represented mean \u00a1\u00be standard deviation. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy, Kaplan-Meier survival curves of the control and radiolabeled construct treatment groups were compared via the log-rank test. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software). Results. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification. To express recombinant proteins, we used a prokaryotic expression system under T7-promoter control. Pre- and post-induction cultures demonstrated tight regulation of expression, evidenced by a prominent 16-kDa protein band both on stained gel and Western blot analyses (Fig.?2A and B). Proteins were expressed in the insoluble inclusion bodies (Fig.?2C). They were therefore subsequently solubilized, denatured, then refolded and purified as we previously described, 15 yielding 0.5?1.5 mg of purified recombinant protein per liter of culture (Fig.?2D). To determine whether TQM13 had refolded correctly and that the multiple mutations did not alter the characteristic \u00a5\u00e1-helix rich secondary structure of IL13, CD analysis was performed. We found that our recombinant TQM13 had a spectrum with 2 minima at approximately 208 and 222 nm, similar to wild-type IL13 (Fig.?2E). Similar results were obtained for the binding-deficient control, BDef13 (not shown). This suggests that the novel targeted multiply-mutated IL13 derivative maintained a similar secondary structure to IL13. TQM13 Demonstrates Affinity Toward the Cancer-Associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12. IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing GBM cell lines and tumors are highly sensitive to chimeric cytotoxins consisting of human IL13 and derivatives of bacterial toxins, such as Diphtheria toxin or Pseudomonas exotoxin A. 14 Of importance, we have demonstrated that this potent killing effect by these cytotoxins is mediated through specific targeting of the cancer-restricted IL13R\u00a5\u00e12. 14 The G26 murine glioma cell line G26-H2 expresses human IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 and is highly susceptible to IL13-based cytotoxins, in contrast to the G26 parental cell line, which does not express any IL13 receptors and is not susceptible to IL13-based cytotoxins (Fig.?3A). 16, 20 To determine whether TQM13 had affinity toward IL13R\u00a5\u00e12, we pre-incubated G26-H2 murine glioma cells with excess TQM13 to saturate and block the IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 binding sites prior to applying a potent IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-targeted bacterial cytotoxin. In the absence of competing TQM13, G26-H2 cells were effectively killed by the IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-targeted IL13-based cytotoxin (Fig.?3A). In contrast, when the cells were pre-incubated with excess TQM13, the cytotoxin no longer killed cells, indicating binding and saturation of IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 sites by TQM13 (Fig.?3A). As expected, such competition was not observed with BDef13 (Fig.?3A) because it did not effectively bind and saturate IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 to prevent cell killing by the cytotoxin. These data indicate that TQM13, but not the BDef13 control, binds to the tumor-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12. We next quantified the IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 binding of TQM13 or BDef13 using surface plasmon resonance in which we separately delivered the ligands over immobilized recombinant hIL13R\u00a5\u00e12-Fc. TQM13 exhibited rapid, concentration-dependent binding to IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 and little dissociation during buffer delivery (Fig.?3B and C). These kinetic studies demonstrated that, at each concentration tested, TQM13 bound rapidly and strongly to the cancer-restricted IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 with a K d of \u00a1\u00ad 5 nM for the initial binding step. In contrast, BDef13 bound \u00a1\u00ad 25-fold more slowly and dissociated \u00a1\u00ad10-fold more quickly, yielding a 250-fold weaker K d of \u00a1\u00ad 1.2 \u00a5\u00ecM (Fig.?3B and D). The concentration dependence of the maximum binding RU signals yielded a similar pattern of tight binding with TQM13 and significantly decreased binding of BDef13 toward the tumor-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 (Fig.?3B). TQM13 Does Not Bind or Activate the Physiologically Abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1. To assess activity of TQM13 toward the physiologically abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 receptor, we performed a functional cell proliferation assay on TF-1 cells, which are pre-leukemic human B cells that express the physiologically abundant IL13Ra1/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 heterodimer and only proliferate in the presence of cytokines, such as GM-CSF, IL13, or IL4. 25, 29, 30 As expected, the cells proliferated in a dose-dependent manner in response to wtIL13. In contrast, TQM13 did not induce TF-1 cell proliferation even when present at very high concentrations, such as 1000 ng/mL (Fig.?4A). To examine whether the lack of TF-1 cell proliferation was attributable to abrogated function versus disrupted binding toward the physiologically abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 heterodimer, we performed a competition assay in which we pretreated TF-1 cells with 100x excess of TQM13 prior to adding wtIL13. However, excess TQM13 did not compete with wtIL13 for the IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 binding sites and, thus, did not prevent wtIL13-induced proliferation (Fig.?4B), indicating a lack of effective binding. To further investigate potential interactions between TQM13 and IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 in a direct manner, we reconstituted the physiologically relevant binding complex in a Biacore experiment. We immobilized soluble recombinant human IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 onto a flow cell and confirmed its functionality by injecting IL4, which bound fast and tight (not shown). In contrast, as expected, wtIL13 did not bind the immobilized IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 receptor (Fig.?4C), because wtIL13 must first bind (weakly) to IL13R\u00a5\u00e11 to recruit the IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 receptor into the heterodimer. 15 Similarly, IL13.E13K and TQM13 did not bind alone to IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 (not shown). However, when injected as a pre-formed wtIL13/IL13R\u00a5\u00e11 complex, there was significant binding to the immobilized IL4R\u00a5\u00e1, reconstituting the wtIL13/IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 complex (Fig.?4C). In contrast, mixtures of IL13.E13K and IL13R\u00a5\u00e11 showed significantly decreased binding (\u00a1\u00ad70%) to the immobilized IL4R\u00a5\u00e1, demonstrating directly for the first time the adverse effects of even a single mutation on the physiological receptor binding. Furthermore, mixtures of the multiply mutated TQM13 and IL13R\u00a5\u00e11 demonstrated a 90% overall binding reduction to IL4R\u00a5\u00e1, compared with the wtIL13 mixture, a >60% additional decrease, compared with the single mutant. Of importance, there was no statistically significant difference between premixed TQM13/IL13R\u00a5\u00e11 binding to immobilized IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 and background (IL13R\u00a5\u00e11 alone) binding to IL4R\u00a5\u00e1. These data for the first time directly demonstrate a significant additive effect of combining multiple mutations on redirecting IL13 away from its physiologically abundant receptor complex (Fig.?4C). 125I-TQM13 Binds Tumor Samples Expressing the Cancer-Associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12. To demonstrate the potential of using TQM13 to deliver diagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes to IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing GBMs, we radioiodinated TQM13 with 125I and confirmed the radiochemical purity at \u00a1\u00c398% using ITLC (Supplemental Figure?1). Furthermore, we directly confirmed binding of radiolabeled TQM13 to IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). We only observed a shift in the molecular weight (mw) of radiolabeled TQM13 mixed with soluble IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 but not in BDef13 mixed with the receptor, indicating that only TQM13 bound IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 (Fig.?5A). In addition, we found that 125I-TQM13 bound IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 expressed on tumor samples by performing digital autoradiography on snap-frozen IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing G48a subcutaneous tumor sections (Fig.?5B), because these tumors express high amounts of IL13R\u00a5\u00e12, confirmed here by IHC (Fig.?5B, Supplemental Figure?2). Of importance, G48a tumor specimens bound 125I-TQM13, but not the radiolabeled binding-deficient control (Fig.?5B). The binding of TQM13 was highly specific because it was displaced by excess unlabeled TQM13 but not excess unlabeled BDef13. Furthermore, we found a direct relationship between IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 expression and 125I-TQM13 binding to cells and tumor specimens (Supplemental Figure?3). Thus, radioiodinated TQM13 retained its affinity toward IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 expressed on GBM tumors. Radiolabeled TQM13 Binds to Clinical GBM Specimens. The cancer-restricted IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 has been shown to be overexpressed in the vast majority of GBMs but is not present in normal brain tissue. 4 Previously reported autoradiographic and immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the prevalence of IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 expression in patients with GBM is approximately 75%. 3, 31, 32 To determine whether the binding activity by TQM13 matched the previously reported prevalence of the receptor, we performed autoradiography with 125I-TQM13 on 10 GBM specimens. All tissue sections were scored independently by 2 reviewers on the basis of the overall specific signal intensity throughout the section and assigned a general qualitative score (0, none; 1, low; 2, moderate; or 3, strong). Our results indicated that 125I-TQM13 bound to 8/10 samples tested with 3 samples having low binding, 4 moderate binding, and 1 strong binding (Fig.?5C). This was similar to the expected number of IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-positive samples. TQM13 Specifically Binds to IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-Expressing Tumors In Vivo. In vivo tumor targeting studies were performed on mice bearing subcutaneous IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing G48a tumors at 24h after intravenous injection of 125I-TQM13 or 125I-BDef13. 125I-TQM13 preferentially bound to IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing tumors at a 7-to-1 tumor-to-muscle ratio 24h after intravenous delivery of radiolabeled ligands. In contrast, 125I-BDef13 did not specifically bind to IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing tumors because its activity remained similar to normal muscle activity at 24h after injection (Fig.?6A). In addition, we tested the tumor targeting of 125I-TQM13 in B16 tumors that do not express IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 and found no significant tumor uptake over background muscle but a significant difference between uptake in IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing G48a tumors (Supplemental Figure?4; P \u00a1\u00c2.05 between G48a-IL13R\u00a5\u00e12(+) tumors and B16-IL13R\u00a5\u00e12(?) tumors). Encouraged by these promising in vivo results, we evaluated the feasibility of using TQM13 as a PET probe to non-invasively image real-time expression of the attractive tumor-associated biomarker IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 in the G48a GBM subcutaneous model. PET scans at 24 and 48h after intravenous radioligand delivery demonstrated significant localization to the IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing tumors by 124I-TQM13 but not 124I-BDef13 (Fig.?6B). ROI analysis quantified the tumor-to-muscle ratio by 124I-TQM13 be 7-to-1 at 48h after injection, whereas 124I-BDef13 remained similar to background activity (Fig.?6C). In addition, radioactivity was transiently localized in the bladder and excreted in the urine (not shown). Radiolabeled 131I-TQM13 Demonstrates Safety and Antitumor Activity Against Subcutaneous IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-Expressing Tumor Xenografts In Vivo. After confirming that TQM13 targets IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing tumors in vivo, we tested the potential of TQM13 as a delivery vehicle for molecular-targeted radiotherapy by performing antitumor experiments in mice bearing the IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing G48a GBM xenografts. GBM cells were implanted subcutaneously in the flank of immunocompromised mice, and IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-targeted radiotherapy was initiated after tumors reached a measurable size of about 100 mm 3 (Fig.?7A). For this pilot experiment, we administered 2 intratumoral injections of 200 \u00a5\u00ecCi 131I-TQM13 (7 days apart), which resulted in tumor growth inhibition and increased overall survival (Fig.?7A and B). All mice treated with 131I-TQM13 survived until at least day 35 after treatment initiation, whereas none of the control animals remained at this time (Fig.?7B). Of importance, no adverse effects or toxicities were observed in the treated mice, compared with the controls. Thus, this indicates for the first time to our knowledge the suitability of targeting IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 with molecular-targeted radiotherapy in vivo using our novel ligand. Radiolabeled 131I-TQM13 Demonstrates Safety and Antitumor Activity Against Orthotopic Synergeic IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-Expressing Tumors In Vivo. To further demonstrate the therapeutic potential of 131I-TQM13, we tested its in vivo safety and efficacy in an orthotropic GBM model after loco-regional delivery to mimic the potential translational scenario. For this orthotopic study, we used the G26-H2 synergeic murine glioma model that we and others have developed to express human IL13R\u00a5\u00e12. 16, 20, 33, 34 In addition to the intracranial location of the tumors, using this model allowed us to evaluate the potential safety and efficacy of 131I-TQM13 in animals with an intact immune system. Tumor cells were stereotactically implanted intracranially, and tumor establishment was verified in all mice via bioluminescent imaging prior to treatment. Expression of IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 in implanted tumors was also confirmed via postmortem autoradiography (Supplemental Figure?5) in selected animals. To test the safety and efficacy of 131I-TQM13, tumor-bearing mice were administered loco-regionally with 94 \u00a5\u00ecCi and 142 \u00a5\u00ecCi of 131I-TQM13 on days 10 and 20, respectively, after tumor implantation. Loco-regional administration was performed after stereotactically targeting the tumor with a needle and administering the therapy over 20?30min under constant pressure from a syringe pump, similar to convection-enhanced delivery. Our results demonstrated that 131I-TQM13 significantly increased survival in mice bearing orthotopic tumors, compared with radioactive control and saline mock injection (Fig.?8). Furthermore, 2 (25%) of 8 treated intracranial tumor-bearing mice from the 131I-TQM13 group were cured and demonstrated no evidence of tumor burden at the conclusion of the study (day 80). Of importance, no adverse effects or toxicities were observed in the treated mice, compared with the controls. These data confirm and strengthen our finding that the novel ligand TQM13 is a potential platform to target the tumor-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 with molecular-targeted radiotherapy. Discussion. In this work, we successfully developed TQM13, a novel IL13-based targeted delivery vehicle with high-affinity binding to the cancer-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 that spared the physiologically abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 heterodimer. These data are of great therapeutic significance, because many groups are targeting IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 in hopes of specifically killing tumor cells. However, therapies that use wtIL13 also target normal tissues that express IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1, in contrast to our targeted quadruple mutant. For example, wtIL13 genetically fused to a fragment of a bacterial toxin (IL13-PE38QQR) was tested in a phase III clinical trial and showed no increased overall survival compared with the standard of care at the time. Although there were major issues that contributed to these disappointing results, including problematic drug delivery and lack of biomarker correlation, there were significant toxicities observed at the given doses, plausibly because of non-specific targeting of the physiologically abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 present in normal brain and immune cells. 3 Because major improvements in loco-regional delivery using image guidance have been achieved and promise to improve results of future trials, 35 the issue of toxicity can be further addressed by targeting only the tumor-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12. In this work, we successfully demonstrated a promising approach using rational site-directed mutagenesis to create a multiply-mutated IL13 derivative, TQM13, which we showed has specific and strong affinity only toward the tumor-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12, but not the physiologically abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 heterodimer. Of importance, we found that the multiple mutations in TQM13 did not functionally activate the physiologically abundant IL13 receptor even at high doses of 1000 ng/mL, in contrast to some activation reported for single mutants at high doses. 15 Furthermore, the disruption of TQM13 binding to the physiologically abundant receptor was further demonstrated by its inability to block wtIL13-mediated IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 receptor activation even at 100-fold excess concentration, in contrast to what has been reported for the single mutant IL13.E13K. 36 The additive effects of multiple mutations in abrogating the interaction between TQM13 and IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 were further confirmed by a significant (\u00a1\u00ad60%) binding reduction in our SPR (Biacore) reconstitution experiment, compared with a single mutant (IL13.E13K), and a 90% overall reduction, compared with wtIL13 (Fig.?4). This broken interaction between TQM13 and IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1 promises to increase the therapeutic window and strengthen the probability of success for IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-targeted agents. In addition to in vitro binding studies, we for the first time demonstrated the feasibility of using TQM13 to target IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing tumors after systemic injection using non-invasive PET imaging (Fig.?6). This is of great significance to other IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing tumors beside GBM, such as peripheral nerve sheath tumors, medulloblastomas, and meningiomas, 6? 9 because TQM13 can be used to non-invasively assess IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 expression using a PET scan. Of importance, this information can be used to personalize biomarker-targeted therapies only to patients expressing the targeted receptor. This approach of personalized anti-cancer therapy has been shown to predict response to biomarker-targeted therapy a priori when used to target other tumor-restricted biomarkers. 37? 40 A significant challenge to delivering molecular-targeted therapeutics to GBM is exclusion from the brain by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after systemic injection. As expected for a macromolecule, we have found that IL13 and TQM13 do not cross the intact BBB (unpublished), although we are currently studying the ability to target GBM in the presence of a tumor-induced leaky BBB. However, despite the limitations caused by the BBB, investigators are working on various mechanisms of bypassing the BBB to deliver molecular therapeutics to GBM, including using molecular targeted nanoparticles capable of crossing the BBB or altering the BBB with drugs and/or radiation to make it more permeable to macromolecules. 41, 42 Therefore, by demonstrating significant tumor targeting of TQM13 in vivo after systemic injection (Fig.?6), we validated its potential as a tumor-targeting ligand capable of delivering diagnostic and therapeutic entities selectively to biomarker-expressing tumors. A promising alternative to systemic delivery of anti-GBM agents is direct loco-regional injection of therapeutics into tumors or resection cavities. In addition to bolus injections, convection enhanced delivery (CED) has been used as a clever approach of bypassing the BBB by directly perfusing therapeutic agents straight into the brain parenchyma or intratumorally. 43? 45 Previous clinical trials using CED for targeted cytotoxins demonstrated that large areas of human brain can be infused by this technique without producing tissue injury, increased intracranial pressure, or systemic toxicity resulting from drug leaking into the circulation. 43, 44, 46 Furthermore, recent innovations in delivering other therapeutic agents to GBM via CED demonstrated that incorporating imaging to confirm proper catheter placement significantly increased the efficacy of this approach. 47? 49 Thus, direct intraparenchymal delivery is an innovative approach of safely delivering sufficiently higher doses of macromolecular anti-cancer therapeutics to GBM, compared with systemic delivery. 46, 50 The development of local delivery methods of bypassing the BBB opens the door to use of moleculer-delivered radioactivity as a viable therapeutic option against GBM. Therefore, we conjugated the cytotoxic \u00a5\u00e2-emitting radioisotope 131I to TQM13 and demonstrated specific inhibition of tumor growth after direct injection into IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing GBMs. We used subcutaneous human tumor xenografts in this pilot in vivo experiment to directly demonstrate the targeting specificity of TQM13, compared with the untargeted, binding deficient BDef13. Furthermore, considering the unique clinical challenges posed by brain tumors and the critical role played by the immune system in cancer radio-immunotherapy, we proceeded to evaluate safety and therapeutic efficacy of 131I-TQM13 in mice bearing synergeic intracranial G26-H2 IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-expressing gliomas. We once again confirmed the antitumor effect of 131I-TQM13 evidenced by significantly prolonged survival in the treatment group compared with that of controls. These data indicate that TQM13, our novel IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-targeting ligand, is suitable for loco-regional convection enhanced delivery, which makes it a promising delivery vehicle for GBM management. Our work demonstrated for the first time the potential of IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-targeted radiotherapy approaches. Of importance, molecular delivery of cytotoxic radioactivity to GBMs has recently shown promising therapeutic potential. 51? 56 Specifically, investigators used an 131I-labeled antibody that targeted Tenascin-C (TN-C), an extracellular matrix brain glycoprotein shown by some groups to be overexpressed in GBM. 54 Early phase clinical trials indicated incremental benefit of 131I-labeled antibody in combination with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide. 52 Although we also used 131I labeling in our pilot in vivo experiments because of its ready availability and ease of radiolabeling, \u00a5\u00e2-emitting radioisotopes may be suboptimal for local delivery in brain cancer, as evidenced by radiotoxicity that occurred to the normal surrounding brain tissue in the pioneering clinical trial that used 131I-labeled anti-TN-C antibodies. Because 131I emits \u00a5\u00e2-rays that travel 0.08?2.3 mm (10?230 cells) 57, it will inevitably kill untargeted surrounding normal brain tissue. However, \u00a5\u00e1-emitting radionuclides, such as 213Bi or 211As, are up to 1000-fold more potent than \u00a5\u00e2-particles emitted by 131I and have a significantly shorter range (6?8 cells) 57. This is of great significance in GBM, in which tumor cells infiltrate normal brain parenchyma that may be damaged if the range of radiotoxic emissions is too long. Furthermore, \u00a5\u00e1-particles efficaciously elicit irreparable double-stranded DNA breaks, in contrast to \u00a5\u00e2-emitters. These advantages are supported by the only clinical study to date that delivered an \u00a5\u00e1-emitter in GBM via loco-regional delivery, in which 211As was conjugated to 81C6, an anti-TN-C antibody. 51 This study concluded that there was significantly less radionecrosis, compared with patients treated with 131I-81C6 anti-TN-C antibody. 51 This and other clinical studies in different malignancies confirm that the strength and short distance traveled by \u00a5\u00e1-particles may make them more suitable than \u00a5\u00e2-emitters for some molecular radiotherapy applications. 58? 61 Of importance, IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 is a receptor membrane protein that is internalized after engaging IL13 or mutants, 62 which is highly advantageous when using short-range \u00a5\u00e1-emitting radioisotopes, in contrast to TN-C, which is an extracellular matrix protein. Thus, this proof-of-concept work validating our novel ligand as a carrier for IL13R\u00a5\u00e12-targeted radioimmunotherapy manifests the therapeutic potential of our approach, which can be further optimized with other choices of radioisotopes in future studies. Antibodies have played a key role in the development of molecular targeting systems that are capable of delivering cytotoxic radioisotopes specifically to biomarker-expressing tumor cells. 63 However, whole antibodies are suboptimal for molecular-targeted radiotherapy approaches because of their long plasma half-life that results in prolonged exposure of normal tissue to radiation. Although smaller-sized antibody fragments and peptides have shown promise in improving these shortcomings, our approach exploits IL13, a natural high-affinity ligand that we successfully retargeted to bind only the tumor-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 but not the physiologically abundant IL13R\u00a5\u00e11/IL4R\u00a5\u00e1. We used rational site-directed mutagenesis to identify the structurally significant parts of IL13 and used this knowledge to engineer TQM13 to optimize its potential as an anti-tumor ligand. 15? 17 In our system, this approach may be advantageous over using antibodies because of the strong binding and very poor dissociation after ligand is bound to IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 (Fig.?3). These favorable binding characteristics are not typically seen by antibody derivatives and are more characteristic of the irreversible biotin/avidin binding. 64 Thus, the data presented here demonstrate for the first time the power of this approach in our receptor system and potentially for targeting other tumor-associated receptors with cytotoxic radionuclides. Conclusion. On the basis of these promising studies that demonstrated a novel approach of targeting IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 using rational site-directed mutagenesis, we anticipate that our optimized ligand will aid in targeting the GBM-associated IL13R\u00a5\u00e12 biomarker with diagnostic and therapeutic entities, including radioisotopes.

                "text": "Combined Drug Action of 2-Phenylimidazo[2,1-b]Benzothiazole Derivatives on Cancer Cells According to Their Oncogenic Molecular Signatures\tThe development of targeted molecular therapies has provided remarkable advances into the treatment of human cancers. However, in most tumors the selective pressure triggered by anticancer agents encourages cancer cells to acquire resistance mechanisms. The generation of new rationally designed targeting agents acting on the oncogenic path(s) at multiple levels is a promising approach for molecular therapies. 2-phenylimidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazole derivatives have been highlighted for their properties of targeting oncogenic Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling. In this study, we evaluated the mechanism of action of one of the most active imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazol-2-ylphenyl moiety-based agents, Triflorcas, on a panel of cancer cells with distinct features. We show that Triflorcas impairs in vitro and in vivo tumorigenesis of cancer cells carrying Met mutations. Moreover, Triflorcas hampers survival and anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells characterized by \u00a1\u00b0RTK swapping\u00a1\u00b1 by interfering with PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 phosphorylation. A restrained effect of Triflorcas on metabolic genes correlates with the absence of major side effects in vivo. Mechanistically, in addition to targeting Met, Triflorcas alters phosphorylation levels of the PI3K-Akt pathway, mediating oncogenic dependency to Met, in addition to Retinoblastoma and nucleophosmin/B23, resulting in altered cell cycle progression and mitotic failure. Our findings show how the unusual binding plasticity of the Met active site towards structurally different inhibitors can be exploited to generate drugs able to target Met oncogenic dependency at distinct levels. Moreover, the disease-oriented NCI Anticancer Drug Screen revealed that Triflorcas elicits a unique profile of growth inhibitory-responses on cancer cell lines, indicating a novel mechanism of drug action. The anti-tumor activity elicited by 2-phenylimidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazole derivatives through combined inhibition of distinct effectors in cancer cells reveal them to be promising anticancer agents for further investigation. Introduction. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling has been implicated in tumor evolution for its capacity to influence cell fate through changes in key regulatory circuits [1]?[3]. As evidenced by cancer genomic studies, RTK signaling is one core pathway frequently altered in human cancer [4], [5]. We have recently shown the relevance of signaling nodes interconnecting RTK and p53 core pathways and the impact of targeting such nodes during tumor evolution [6], [7]. The relevance of altered RTKs in oncogenesis has drawn tremendous interest to identify agents capable of restraining their activity and function. To date, molecular therapies for \u00a1\u00b0RTK-addicted\u00a1\u00b1 cancer cells are mainly based on the application of compounds that selectively target the oncogenic RTK [1]. However, the success of these strategies has been limited since inhibition of the \u00a1\u00b0primary RTK-addiction\u00a1\u00b1 triggers a selective pressure on cancer cells to acquire resistance through \u00a1\u00b0RTK swapping\u00a1\u00b1 [8], [9]. These limitations impose the identification, or the combined use, of agents that not only target RTK signaling dependency, but also hamper adaptation caused by redundancy in the RTK signaling network [10]. One approach to circumvent \u00a1\u00b0RTK swapping\u00a1\u00b1 could be the identification of drugs interfering with oncogene dependency by acting at multiple levels within the addiction path. An example of this concept is provided by Sorafenib, a small chemical agent able to inhibit several RTKs, including VEGFR, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2, Kit, FGFR1, Ret, and the intracellular Raf kinase [11]. The broad-spectrum activity of Sorafenib in several cancer models is likely due to the wide range of its targets. Nevertheless, Sorafenib activity in some types of tumor models is attributed to the concomitant inhibition of RTK-driven angiogenesis and the RTK downstream Raf/MAPK pathway [11]. The generation of agents, which target oncogenic path(s) at multiple levels, is not a simple issue as distinct targets require a precise drug structure and chemical modifications of drugs can either affect selectivity (e.g. by targeting multiple RTKs), effectiveness, or toxcicity. In contrast to other RTKs, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor Met is characterized by unusual structural plasticity as its active site can adopt distinct inhibitor binding modes [12]. Indeed, a wide range of small-molecules have been discovered as Met inhibitors [13], [14]. Nevertheless, efforts continue to uncover novel anti-Met agents for targeted therapies and associated resistance mechanisms [8], [15]?[17]. To identify chemical agents capable of inhibiting oncogenic Met signaling in cancer cells, we previously applied a Met-focused cell-based screen. We had reasoned that such a strategy would offer the possibility of identifying compounds that may: a) elicit inhibitory effects directly on Met; b) target other essential components in the Met signaling cascade; c) be well tolerated due to limited toxic effects at biologically active concentrations [18]?[20]. We reported that new amino acid amides containing the imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazol-2-ylphenyl moiety target Met directly and inhibit oncogenic Met function, without eliciting major side effects in vitro [19]. In this study, we explored the anticancer activity of one of the most active agents we have identified, Triflorcas (TFC), on a panel of cancer cells with distinct characteristics and investigated its mechanism of drug action by a range of complementary approaches. We show that Triflorcas targets cancer cells either carrying Met mutations or characterized by RTK swapping. We demonstrate that Triflorcas is well tolerated in vivo and does not significantly alter the expression of several cell toxicity and stress genes. Biochemical and phospho-screening array studies revealed that Triflorcas predominantly alters the phosphorylation levels of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which ensures oncogenic dependency to Met, as well as Retinoblastoma (Rb), and nucleophosmin/B23. These alterations functionally correlate with changes in cell cycle progression underlying mitotic failure. Although Triflorcas anticancer activity correlates with its inhibitory effects on Met, its drug action mechanisms may not be merely restricted to Met target itself. The unique ability of Triflorcas to modulate multiple pathways deregulated in tumor cells with aberrant Met signaling further strengthens the prospect of exploiting the flexible-binding mode capacity of Met active site to identify new agents with inhibitory properties towards signaling targets required to execute the oncogenic program. Finally, the assessment of the inhibitory-response profile on cancer cells through the National Cancer Institute anticancer drug screen suggests that Triflorcas is characterized by a novel mechanism of drug action. Bioinformatics studies indicate possible molecular signatures that correlate with cancer sensitivity to imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazol-2-ylphenyl moiety-based agents. Results. Triflorcas Inhibits Survival and Anchorage-independent Growth of Human Cancer Cells Carrying Mutated Met. We first examined the effect of Triflorcas on two human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells carrying Met mutations: H2122 and H1437 cells, harboring point mutations at the amino acid residue N375S and R988C, respectively [21]. Triflorcas impaired survival and anchorage independent growth of H2122 and H1437, respectively (Figure 1A and B). None of the Met inhibitors used as reference compounds, such as SU11274, crizotinib, and PHA665752 interfered with survival and in vitro tumorigenesis of these cells (Figure 1A and B). In contrast, all tested inhibitors impaired survival and anchorage independent growth of human gastric carcinoma GTL-16 characterized by Met amplification (Figure 1A and B), as previously reported [19], [21]. These data suggest that Triflorcas exerts a marked inhibitory effect on cancer cells with Met mutations, which are not sensitive to other Met inhibitors, in addition to cells carrying Met amplification. Triflorcas Interferes with Met Phosphorylation, with Met Localization, and with PI3K-Akt Pathway Activation. We have previously shown that Triflorcas interferes with Met phosphorylation in living cells and with Met activation in vitro [19]. We therefore investigated the effects of Triflorcas on Met in H1437 cells by following Met phosphorylation on two tyrosine residues located in its kinase domain, Tyr 1234 and Tyr 1235. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed Met phosphorylation predominantly on the plasma membrane when H1437 cells were exposed to HGF stimulation (Figure 2A). Notably, we found that Triflorcas leads to changes in phosphorylated Met: a) down-regulation of its phosphorylation levels and b) a predominant localization in intracellular compartments (Figure 2A). Treatment with chlorpromazine, a cationic amphipathic drug that inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis, restored phospho-Met localization at the cellular membrane, thus indicating that Triflorcas enhances Met internalization (Figure 2A) Reduced Met phosphorylation was also observed in protein lysates from H1437 cells accompanied by reduced Met protein levels (Figure 2B). Densitometric analysis indicated that Met down-regulation through endocytosis causes the decrease in Met phosphorylation (data not shown). Consistently, we found reduced phosphorylation of Gab1, which is an immediate signaling target of Met (Figure 2B). The biological effect of Triflorcas on cells carrying Met mutations and Met amplification (Figure 1) [19] led us to evaluate the phosphorylation status of RTK downstream effectors. Among pathways required in cancer cells with oncogenic Met, it has been shown that only a subset of Met-activated pathways sustains the dependency of cancer cells on Met. In particular, the Ras/ERKs and the PI3K/Akt are two pathways that predominantly ensure dependence on oncogenic Met [22]. We therefore explored whether Triflorcas restricts the activation of these two pathways by following the phosphorylation level of ERKs and Akt in H1437 cells. No significant changes were observed on HGF-induced ERK phosphorylation when H1437 cells were exposed to Triflorcas (Figure 2B). In contrast, Akt phosphorylation was significantly reduced after Triflorcas treatment (Figure 2B). Reduced phospho-Akt was paralleled with a decrease in the phosphorylation levels of its downstream signal p70 S6K (Figure 2B). Consistently, reduced phosphorylation levels of Akt and its downstream signals p70 S6K and S6 ribosomal protein, but not ERKs, were observed also in GTL-16 cells (Figure 2C). We confirmed the functional relevance of intact PI3K/Akt signaling for anchorage-independent growth of H1437 and GTL-16 cells by pharmacologically blocking its activation with LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or A-443654 (Akt inhibitor) (Figure 2D, E, S1A, and 1B). The decrease of Akt phosphorylation after Triflorcas treatment was also observed in the ErbB1-addicted human breast cancer BT474 cells, where ErbB1 phosphorylation levels were unchanged (Figure S1C) [19]. Together, these results indicate that the reduction of PI3K/Akt pathway activation by Triflorcas is not merely a consequence of the inhibition of upstream RTK activity. We also found that Akt activity is not required for survival of BT474 cells (Figure S1D). These results provide insights into BT474 cell resistance to Triflorcas treatment by showing that their addiction to oncogenic ErbB1 is ensured by pathway(s) other than PI3K/Akt. Together, these findings reveal that the anti-tumor activity elicited by Triflorcas occurs through combined outcomes on distinct effectors involved in RTK-driven oncogenic dependency. Triflorcas Impairs in vivo Tumor Growth of Human Cancer Cells Carrying Met Mutation, Without Causing Major Side Effects. We have recently reported that Triflorcas is well tolerated by primary neurons and hepatocytes [19]. To evaluate further the potential therapeutic application of this compound, we assessed whether it is also well tolerated after in vivo administration. Triflorcas was intra-peritoneally injected into mice at a dose of 30 mg.kg -1 each day. As body weight is a generic indicator of animal physiology influenced, for example, by metabolism, animal activity, and feeding behavior, the weight of Triflorcas-treated mice was followed over time. No significant differences were found versus controls and throughout treatment (P>0.05; Figure 3A). We also measured the weight of the heart, spleen, kidney, and liver of mice treated for 21 days and no differences were found between the two groups (P>0.05; Figure 3B). We previously showed that Triflorcas elicits tumor growth inhibition of GTL-16 cells in vivo (Figure S2) [19]. We therefore determined whether the antitumor action of Triflorcas observed in vitro on H1437 cells might also be evidenced in vivo using xenografted nude mice. H1437 cells (5\u00a1\u00bf10 6) were sub-cutaneously injected into nude mice. After tumor formation, the mice were treated with Triflorcas, crizotinib, or vehicle alone, and tumor growth was examined during and after treatment. Notably, we found a 58.7% and 59% reduction in tumor volume when Triflorcas was administered at a dose of 30 mg.kg ?1 or 60 mg.kg ?1 every other day, respectively (control: 82.4 mm 3\u00a1\u00be78.2; 30 mg.kg ?1 Triflorcas injection: 34.0\u00a1\u00be24.5; P=0.04; 60 mg.kg ?1 Triflorcas injection: 33.8\u00a1\u00be24.2; P=0.04; Figure 3C). A reduction of tumor weight was also observed in Triflorcas-treated mice (control: 147.1 mg \u00a1\u00be92.5; 30 mg.kg ?1 Triflorcas injection: 79.1\u00a1\u00be58.1, P=0.03; 60 mg.kg ?1 Triflorcas injection: 62.0\u00a1\u00be38.9, P=0.01; Figure 3D). In contrast, no reduction in tumor growth was found in mice treated with crizotinib at doses of 50 mg.kg ?1 every day (tumor volume: 118.6 mm 3\u00a1\u00be69.4; tumor size: 205.0 mg \u00a1\u00be84.8; Figure 3C and D), consistent with previous studies [21]. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that in vivo Triflorcas elicits tumor growth inhibition of cancer cells with oncogenic Met. Moreover, the absence of side effects indicates that Triflorcas is well tolerated when injected into mice at doses required to elicit its anti-tumor effects. Minor Changes in Gene Expression Profile of Stress and Toxicity Pathways by Triflorcas Correlate with Lack of Toxic Effects in vivo. As Triflorcas is well tolerated both in vitro [19] and in vivo (Figure 3A and B), we next followed gene expression levels of a human RT-PCR array focused on toxicity and stress pathways. The expression profile of 84 genes related to cell stress and toxicity was analyzed in GTL-16 cells exposed to Triflorcas, SU11274, or vehicle. SU11274 altered the expression of 39 genes for at least 2-fold (by increasing or decreasing them; P<0.05). These genes belong to the apoptosis/necrosis (n=10), inflammation (n=7), oxidative/metabolic stress (n=7), heat shock (n=6), proliferation/carcinogenesis (n=5), and growth arrest/senescence pathways (n=4; Figure 4A and Table S1). In contrast, Triflorcas led to a statistically significant change in expression of only 14 genes (P<0.05). Among them, 13 genes overlapped with those altered by SU11274, and belonged to apoptosis/necrosis (n=3), oxidative/metabolic stress (n=3), and growth arrest/senescence (n=3; Figure 4A and Table S1). No significant decrease of gene expression beyond 50% compared to control cells could be observed. Genes showing over a 2-fold increase in expression levels included tnf (3.83-fold; P=0.0008), gdf15 (3.18-fold; P=0.0007), egr1 (2.68-fold; P=0.003), and serpine1 (2.42-fold; P=0.005). Intriguingly, Triflorcas led to a robust and predominant up-regulation of the cytochrome oxidase cyp1a1 gene (611-fold; P=0.0001; Figure 4A). Expression of the cyp1a1 gene was also increased by SU11274, but at significant lower levels (22-fold; P=0.02; Figure 4A). CYP1A1 is a member of the CYP1 family of cytochrome P450 implicated in cancer cell response to therapeutic agents. Western blot analysis confirmed the up-regulation of CYP1A1 protein by Triflorcas, which was impaired by its inhibitor acacetin (Figure 4B) [23]. CYP1A1 up-regulation by Triflorcas was independent of its action on Met as found also in cells, such as in the human breast cancer BT474 cells (Figure 4C), which are addicted to ErbB1 signaling. Together, these studies underline a selective metabolism activity profile elicited by Triflorcas linked to the up-regulation of a small subset of stress and toxicity genes. Thus, the minimal number of genes affected by Triflorcas indicates that this compound elicits more selective action on stress and toxicity genes compared to other Met anticancer agents such as SU11274. Triflorcas Mechanisms of Drug Action and its Effects on Cell Cycle Progression Leading to Mitotic Failure. The effects of Triflorcas on the PI3K-Akt pathway evidenced by biochemical studies (Figure 2B and C) suggest that Triflorcas anticancer properties may be associated with its activity on distinct signaling targets in addition to Met. One screening approach broadly used to identify targets of a given chemical agent is the KINOMEscan, which allows assessing the activity of compounds against a panel of kinases through binding assays [24]. Triflorcas was screened against 98 kinases at a single concentration of 10 \u00a5\u00ecM, in agreement with standard protocols. However, the low solubility of Triflorcas in buffer conditions used for this type of screen limited the possibility of identifying targeted kinases. Nevertheless, we found that Triflorcas reduces by more than 30% the binding constant of only 5 over 98 kinases analyzed: Abl-1 (either wild-type, or E255K and T315I mutant forms), IKK-beta, JAK2, MKNK1, and ZAP70 (Figure 5 and Table S2). Although the pattern of kinases interacting with Triflorcas appears highly focused, these results must take into account that a proportion of targets were possibly not detected due to the low solubility of Triflorcas in buffer conditions used for this screen. For example, Met was not identified despite the fact that Triflorcas inhibitory activity was previously established using the Kinexus compound profiling service [19]. Therefore, to further investigate the mechanism of drug action of Triflorcas, we applied a cell-based assay, which allows evaluation of the agent\u00a1\u00afs effects on multiple oncogenic signaling pathways in culture conditions compatible with Triflorcas solubility and biological activity. The phosphorylation levels of several signaling molecules were therefore examined by using the Kinexus phosphorylated protein screen array. In particular, we compared the phosphorylation levels of 44 signaling phospho-epitopes in GTL-16 cells treated or not with Triflorcas (Figure 6, S3, and Table S3). Consistent with our biochemical studies, we found that the phosphorylation state of several components within the PI3K/Akt pathway was altered in cells exposed to Triflorcas. In particular, reduced phosphorylation levels were observed for Akt1, mTOR/FRAP, p70 S6Kb1, and S6 ribosomal protein (Figure 6A and B; red circles). Intriguingly, we found that Triflorcas significantly alters the phosphorylation status of two additional proteins: the phosphorylation of Rb on different Ser/Thr residues was reduced (Figure 6A and B; blue circles); the phosphorylation of nucleophosmin/B23, a nucleolar protein found to be significantly abundant in tumors [25], was increased (Figure 6A and B; green circles). Western blot analysis confirmed changes in the phosphorylation state of Rb and nucleophosmin/B23 proteins after Triflorcas treatment (Figure 6C). As both Rb and nucleophosmin/B23 are key regulators of cell cycle progression, we next evaluated whether these changes in phosphorylation state were paralleled with alteration of the cell cycle. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and their distribution in different cell cycle phases was assessed by flow cytometric analysis. Untreated GTL-16 cells were proliferating, as confirmed by the flow cytometry pattern (Figure 7A and data not shown). Triflorcas treatment alters GTL-16 cell cycle distribution, with an increase of the G0/G1 cell population at the expense of the S and G2/M population (Figure 7A and data not shown). As controls, treatment of GTL-16 cells with either SU11274 or nocodazol led to a blockage into G0/G1 or G2/M phase, respectively (data not shown). Thus, Triflorcas affects cell cycle progression of GTL-16 cells. Morphological analysis of cells exposed to Triflorcas showed a significant increase in the number of multinucleated cells, which indicates mitotic failure (Figure 7B and C). In contrast, no mitotic failure was observed in cells treated with SU11274, crizotinib, or PHA665752 (Figure 7C). Together, these findings show that the anti-tumor activity elicited by Triflorcas may in part account for phosphorylation changes of distinct signaling targets, such as components of the PI3K/Akt pathway, Rb, and nucleophosmin/B23, which correlates with alterations in cell cycle progression and mitotic failure. Triflorcas Impairs Survival and Anchorage-independent Growth of Human Cancer Cells Characterized by RTK Swapping. One major limitation of molecular therapies using agents targeting distinct RTKs is the drug resistance mechanism, which can be either constitutive or acquired after treatment. In this context, it has been shown that Met, ErbBs, and PDGFRs can reciprocally substitute for each other to maintain the activity of RTK-driven oncogenic pathways [9], [26]?[29]. We therefore evaluated the inhibitory properties of Triflorcas in cancer cell lines, in which reciprocal substitution of Met, ErbBs, and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 confers resistance to single RTK inhibition. Human glioblastoma-astrocytoma U87 cells were used as a model of RTK swapping [27]. Survival and anchorage-independent growth assays were performed by comparing the effectiveness of Triflorcas to that of other Met inhibitors. We found that Triflorcas impaired U87 cell survival in a dose-dependent manner compared to SU11274, crizotinib, and PHA665752 (Figure 8A). Notably, Triflorcas drastically reduced anchorage-independent growth of U87 cells, whereas both SU11274 and Gefitinib (ErbB1 inhibitor) elicited only moderate anchorage-independent growth inhibition (Figure 8B and C), as previously shown [27]. By evaluating the compound IC 50, we found that the Triflorcas inhibitory effects were elicited at lower doses compared to those required in GTL-16 Met-addicted cells (U870.2 \u00a5\u00ecM; GTL-160.811 \u00a5\u00ecM), and more effectively than those elicited by SU11274 or Gefitinib (1.9 \u00a5\u00ecM and 9.5 \u00a5\u00ecM, respectively; Figure 8C). We therefore investigated whether Triflorcas acts also on other target(s) than Met. ErbB1 and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 were two obvious candidates as they are responsible for RTK swapping. We excluded that Triflorcas acts on ErbB1 as: a) ErbB1 phosphorylation was unaffected by Triflorcas in BT474 cells (Figure S1C) [19], and b) ErbB1 is not predominantly phosphorylated in U87 cells under normal conditions (data not shown), as previously reported [27]. In contrast, we observed a drastic reduction in PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 phosphorylation when cells were exposed to Triflorcas (Figure 8D). Remarkably, Triflorcas efficiently reduced PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 phosphorylation at lower doses compared to Imatinib or Nilotinib (Figure 8D), two agents targeting PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2, c-Kit, and c-Abl [30]. Triflorcas almost abolished PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 phosphorylation in U87 cells at 0.3 \u00a5\u00ecM, whereas Imatinib or Nilotinib partially reduced PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 phosphorylation only at 3 \u00a5\u00ecM (Figure 8D). Together, these findings show that Triflorcas exerts its anti-tumorigenic activity also on cancer cells with oncogenic RTK swapping. Triflorcas Elicits a Distinct Growth Inhibitory-response Profile in Cancer Cell Lines. To further elucidate the anticancer properties of imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazol-2-ylphenyl moiety-based agents, we evaluated Triflorcas bioactivity by applying the disease-oriented NCI Anticancer Drug Screen [31]. This developmental therapeutic program historically allowed the efficient capture of compounds with anti-proliferative activity. In a preliminary test, Triflorcas was assayed at a single concentration of 10 \u00a5\u00ecM in the full NCI60 cancer cell line panel (Figure S4). As it satisfied predetermined threshold inhibition criteria established for the NCI Anticancer Drug Screen, according to a minimum number of targeted cell lines, Triflorcas anticancer activity was then evaluated by using a full range of concentrations, in agreement with standard protocols (10, 100 nM, 1, 10, 100 \u00a5\u00ecM). Results were expressed as the percentage of living cells following 48 hours of incubation (Figure 9). A decrease in cell number was seen in a proportion of cancer cells, with the mean log 10 GI 50 (growth inhibition) of ?5.5\u00a1\u00be0.5M (Figure S5). The mean log 10 LC 50 (lethal concentration) calculated for these cell lines was ?4.3\u00a1\u00be0.3M (Figure S5). The COMPARE algorithm allows the identification of compounds whose pattern of growth inhibition is similar to the agent of interest [31]. Using this approach, we found that the Triflorcas activity correlated only minimally with that of known standard chemotherapeutic drugs (maximal correlation 0.335; Table S4). We further widened the comparison to the publicly available data from synthetic compounds screened on the NCI60 cancer cell line panel, and found that none of these compounds significantly matched with Triflorcas, as maximal correlation reached only 0.63 (Table S5). Thus, the unique growth inhibitory-response profile on cancer cells corresponding to solid tumors and leukemia indicates that imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazol-2-ylphenyl moiety-based agents are characterized by a novel mechanism of drug action. To get insights into potential molecular signatures characterizing cancer cells sensitive to Triflorcas, we performed bioinformatics studies using a large set of signaling database. In particular, we compared the response of the NCI60 cancer cell line panel to Triflorcas with NCI data resources from three databases: \u00a1\u00b0Microarrays\u00a1\u00b1, \u00a1\u00b0All NCI dataset\u00a1\u00b1, and \u00a1\u00b0Only Protein subset NCI\u00a1\u00b1 (Figure 10). These studies highlighted a significant correlation between Triflorcas responsiveness and specific molecular changes (belonging to strong positive and weak positive correlation values). Signals with high correlation score included: cytoskeleton-associated protein4 (CKAP4), secernin1 (SCRN1), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2 (MAP2K2), myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MAPCKS), SMAD4, FIP1L1, p53, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), and tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) (Figure 11A). Notably, FOXO3 and TSC2 are known to be regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is targeted by Triflorcas (Figure 2 and ?and6).6). To further support bioinformatics outcomes, we experimentally assessed Triflorcas effects on signals highlighted in the three lists: \u00a1\u00b0microarrays\u00a1\u00b1, \u00a1\u00b0all NCI dataset\u00a1\u00b1, and \u00a1\u00b0only protein subset NCI\u00a1\u00b1. For this purpose, GTL-16 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids that enable measuring the activity of p53, Smad2/3/4, AP-1 (as read of the MAP2K2-JNK pathway) or NFAT (as readout of the PKC-MARCKS pathway) promoters. As Triflorcas does not affect ERK signaling (Figure 2B and C), an Elk1-SRF reporter plasmid was used as negative control. Luciferase activity was measured in cells after 48 hours treatment with vehicle or Triflorcas. Consistently with bioinformatics studies, we found that Triflorcas enhanced luciferase activity controlled by p53, Smad2/3/4, AP-1, NFAT, but not Elk1-SRF, promoters (Figure 11B). As JNK/AP-1 pathway activation can lead to distinct biological outcomes ranging from apoptosis induction to enhanced survival, tumor progression, and metastasis, according to its strength of stimulation and the signaling context [32], it will be relevant to assess JNK-AP-1 function on a panel of cancer cells sensitive to Triflorcas. Together, these studies show that compounds characterized by the imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazol-2-ylphenyl moiety define a new class of chemical agents displaying anticancer activity towards distinct cancer cell types, according to molecular signatures indicated by bioinformatics studies. Discussion. Aberrant Met signaling in tumors recapitulates all the biological events controlled by Met during embryogenesis [33]?[42] and regenerative processes [43], [44]. To target oncogenic Met signaling, we originally generated a virtual chemical library of known anticancer agents and assessed their ability to interact with Met active site through computer modeling studies [12]. We reasoned that the flexibility of Met active site may offer the benefit of generating compounds in which anticancer properties and Met inhibitory features can be merged. The previously described imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazol-2-ylphenyl compounds interact with Met active sites, as evaluated by in silico studies, interfere with Met phosphorylation, as assessed through biochemical and in vitro kinase assays, and hamper survival and anchorage-independent growth of Met-dependent cancer cells [19]. In the present study, we assessed the anticancer properties of Triflorcas, one of the most biologically active agents containing the imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazol-2-ylphenyl moiety, on a panel of cancer cells. Our findings suggest that Triflorcas and its derivatives are promising agents to further exploit for targeting cancer cells: a) carrying Met amplification (such as GTL-16 cells, as previously shown [19]); b) carrying Met mutations (such as H2122 and H1437 cells); c) characterized by RTK swapping (such as U87 cells). By investigating the mechanism of drug action, we found that extinction of Met oncogenic signaling by Triflorcas occurs through at least three distinct mechanisms: a) by restraining Met activity [19], its phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of its immediate downstream signals such as Gab1; b) by enhancing Met internalization and degradation; c) by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of Akt and of its downstream targets mTOR, p70 S6K, and S6 ribosomal protein, one pathway known to ensure Met dependency of cancer cells [22]. It is possibly the combination of these three actions that allows Triflorcas to be an effective inhibitor of cancer cells with oncogenic Met. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of intracellular trafficking to the cellular response of activated Met in tumorigenesis [45], [46]. As Triflorcas enhances Met internalization and degradation, it will be relevant to assess its properties on cancer cells carrying oncogenic forms of Met that render the receptor refractory to degradation [46]. We also show that the inhibitory properties of Triflorcas in cancer cells with RTK swapping can be partially attributed to its capacity to interfere with PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 phosphorylation. Concerning the PI3K/Akt pathway, it is tempting to speculate that Triflorcas reduces its activation to a threshold level that becomes non-permissive for cancer cells when combined with inhibition of other oncogenic signals. Importantly, the reduction of PI3K/Akt pathway activation by Triflorcas, rather than its complete inhibition with more potent and selective drugs, might have the beneficial effect of minimizing side effects that limit the use of these latter in clinics [47], [48]. The effects on the PI3K pathway appear to be a direct action of Triflorcas on this pathway rather than being merely a consequence of its effects on Met. Several data support this hypothesis: a) selective inhibition of Akt function compromises in vitro tumorigenesis of H1437 and GTL-16 cells; b) decreased phosphorylation levels of the Akt, but not Ras/ERKs, pathway was observed in H1437 and GTL-16 cells; c) reduced Akt phosphorylation was observed also in ErbB1-addicted cells, which are resistant to Triflorcas. Beside its effects on the PI3K/Akt pathway, Triflorcas also influences the phosphorylation states of Rb and nucleophosmin/B23, two key regulators of cell cycle progression. Consistently, we found that Triflorcas treatment increases the G0/G1 cell population, leading to mitotic failure. Future studies will clarify how Triflorcas and its derivatives influence Rb and nucleophosmin/B23, whether there is a correlation between changes in their phosphorylation levels and alteration of the PI3K/Akt pathway, and whether these signaling alterations cause microtubular network dynamic instability and impaired mitotic spindle formation. Our stress and toxicity RT-PCR array studies evidenced two additional properties of 2-phenylimidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazole derivatives. First, in contrast to SU11274, Triflorcas changes the expression of only 14 out of 84 genes, which are predominantly related to oxidative/metabolic stress, necrosis/apoptosis, and growth arrest/senescence. This limited alteration of stress and toxicity gene expression by Triflorcas correlates with the absence of major side effects observed in cultured neurons and hepatocytes [19], as well as in vivo (Figure 3A and B). Second, the expression levels of CYP1A1 are drastically up-regulated in tumor cells treated with Triflorcas. CYP1A1 belongs to the CYP1 cytochrome P450 family and has been implicated in cancer cell response to therapeutic agents by biotransforming them from prodrugs to active drugs [49]. CYP1A1 is the most up-regulated gene in cancer cells exposed to the benzothiazole derivative Phortress, its precursor (5F-203) or its desfluoro derivative (DF-203), chemotherapeutic prodrugs currently evaluated in clinical trials [50]. It is well established that these benzothiazole derivatives up-regulate, bind covalently to, and are metabolically bioactivated by CYP1A1 in sensitive cells [51], [52]. As Phortress and Triflorcas contain a similar heterocyclic moiety (Figure S6), it is reasonable that this part of the molecule plays a relevant role in up-regulating CYP1A1 expression in cancer cells. Future studies will clarify whether CYP1A1 influences the effects of Triflorcas by generating specific metabolites. Comparing the profiles of NCI cancer cells responding to Triflorcas and to benzothiazole compounds [49], [51], we intriguingly found a limited overlap, indicating that Triflorcas hampers cancer cells with mechanisms of drug sensitivity distinct to Phortress and its derivatives. We have also evaluated the functional relevance of CYP1A1 up-regulation by Triflorcas for its anti-tumorigenic activity and found that CYP1A1 pharmacological impairment did not significantly influence the inhibitory properties of Triflorcas on cell survival and anchorage independent growth (data not shown). Although the up-regulation of CYP1A1 does not appear to be the main event by which Triflorcas elicits its anti-tumor effects, we cannot exclude that, in some neoplastic cells, the modulation of anticancer pharmaceuticals by CYP1A1 may prove to be an advantage above additional mechanisms of action of 2-phenylimidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazole derivatives. Genome-wide profiling and protein-network-based studies have recently established two important aspects related to cancer complexity. First, tumor evolution is often characterized by the acquisition of mutations in a small number of \u00a1\u00b0core pathways\u00a1\u00b1 [4], [5]. Therefore, agents targeting a core pathway at distinct levels could restrain its oncogenic contribution and possibly minimize resistance mechanism. Second, RTKs share several effectors that participate in the oncogenic process and in the drug response [9]. This opens the possibility of designing anticancer therapies targeting mandatory signals in addition to hitting RTK activity directly. The benefit of combining drugs acting at distinct oncogenic levels is a well-established principle of cancer therapy, supported by several experimental settings [10]. However, determining which combinations would maximize effectiveness among the limitless possibilities remains a major challenge. Our studies establish that the flexibility of Met to accept different inhibitor binding modes offers the possibility to develop drugs targeting oncogenic Met signaling dependency at different levels as an alternative strategy. Although these agents might be less potent in directly impairing Met function compared to others discovered through exhaustive co-crystallographic studies, they may offer the possibility of lowering the activation of oncogenic dependency at non-permissive threshold levels, minimizing redundant pathways, either originally present in the tumor cells or acquired following treatment. Similarly to Sorafenib and here reported outcomes for Triflorcas, it is conceivable that compounds containing the imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazol-2-ylphenyl moiety may have the ability to influence the oncogenic program by exerting modulation of distinct targets, as also evidenced by the disease-oriented NCI Anticancer Drug Screen. Thus, its novel mechanism of drug action together with a favorable side effect profile makes the 2-phenylimidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazole a relevant moiety to be further explored for the treatment of a broad range of tumor types. Materials and Methods. Cell Culture. Human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H1437 and H2122 cell lines, human breast cancer BT474 cells, and human glioblastoma-astrocytoma U87 cells were acquired from the America Type Culture Collection. Human gastric carcinoma GTL-16 cells are subclones of MKN45 cells (from Riken Cell Bank) obtained by limiting dilution [22]. H1437, H2122, BT474, and GTL-16 cells were grown in RPMI medium (Gibco-BRL), whereas U87 cells in Eagle\u00a1\u00afs Minimum Essential Medium (ATCC). Culture media were supplemented with 4mM L-glutamine and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco-BRL), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL streptomycin. Cells were kept at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2. H2122 and H1437 cells were used for survival and anchorage independent growth assays, respectively, according to their suitability for these biological assays. Compound Treatments. SU11274, Gefitinib, LY294002, acacetin, andresveratrol were purchased from Calbiochem; chlorpromazine and nocodazol from Sigma; crizotinib (PF-2341066) from Active Biochemicals; PHA665752 from Tocris Bioscience; Imatinib and Nilotinib were kindly provided by E. Buchdunger and P. Manley (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland); A-443654 (Akt inhibitor) was kindly provided by V.L.Giranda (ABBOTT Laboratories, Illinois, USA). For survival assays (H2122, GTL-16, and BT474 cells) and cell cycle analyses (GTL-16 cells), cells were cultured in serum-free media for 24 hours prior to compound addition for 48 hours. Survival assays with U87 cells was carried out in 0.1% serum. Viability was assessed with the Cell-Titer-Glo-Luminescent-Assay (Promega). For in vitro tumorigenesis, soft agar growth assays were performed as previously described [19]. Data on biological assays are representative of three independent experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate. Biochemical and Immuno-cytochemical Evaluation of Met Inhibitors. Cells were treated with inhibitors for 24 or 72 hours, as reported in the corresponding figures. Total extracts were analyzed as described [37]. Antibodies used were anti-tubulin, anti-actin (Sigma), anti-phosphoY 1234?1235-Met, anti-p70 S6K, anti-phosphoT 389-p70 S6K, anti-phosphoT 202Y 204-p70 S6K, anti-Akt, anti-phosphoS 473-Akt, anti-S6, anti-phosphoS 235/236-S6, anti-phosphoS 240/244-S6, anti phosphoT 202Y 204-ERKs, anti-ERKs, anti- phosphoY 627-Gab1, anti-phosphoY 751-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2, anti-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2, and anti-phosphoY 1068-ErbB1 (Cell Signaling), anti-ErbBs, anti-Met, and anti-CYP1A1 (Santa Cruz), anti-Gab1 (Upstate), Alexa 546-conjugated-goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen). In vivo Assays. Mice were kept at the IBDML animal facilities. All procedures involving the use of animals were performed in accordance with the European Community Council Directive of 24 November 1986 on the protection of animals used for experimental purposes (86/609/EEC). The experimental protocols were carried out in compliance with institutional Ethical Committee guidelines for animal research (comite d\u00a1\u00afethique pour l\u00a1\u00afexperimentation animale ? Comite d\u00a1\u00afethique de Marseille; agreement number D13-055-21 by the Direction departementale des services veterinaires ? Prefecture des Bouches du Rhone). To evaluate compound toxicity in vivo, the weight of mice treated with Triflorcas (intra-peritoneally (i.p.) injection: 30 mg.kg ?1) or vehicle was measured before, during, and after treatment. For heart, spleen, kidney, and liver weight, mice were sacrificed after 21 days of daily Triflorcas or vehicle treatment. Tumor xenografts were established by sub-cutaneous injection of H1437 cells (5\u00a1\u00bf10 6) in nude mice (S/SOPF SWISS NU/NU; Charles River). Treatment was initiated when tumors achieved an average volume of 15mm 3 (approximately 7 days after cell injection; n=10 mice per group). Mice were injected with: Triflorcas (i.p. 30 or 60 mg.kg ?1 of body weight) or vehicle every other day; crizotinib (oral gavage 50 mg.kg ?1 of body weight, in agreement with standard protocol) daily. Triflorcas was formulated in Cremophor-EL:DMSO (11, v/v) and diluted in sterile 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride. This formulation is classically applied for the administration of different chemical agents and does not elicit toxic effects, as revealed by no changes in mouse body weight during treatment. Mice were then sacrificed after 21 days of treatment. Tumor volume was determined from caliper measurements of tumor length (L) and width (W) according to the formula LW 2/2. Tumor size was measured every week and at the end of the experiment. Tumor weight was established at the end of treatment. Two independent assays were performed (n=8 mice per group). For tumor xenograft studies with GTL-16 cells, cells (10 6) were i.p. injected in nude mice. Mice were treated with Triflorcas (i.p. 30 mg.kg ?1) or vehicle at day 1 and treatment was repeated every other day. Mice were then sacrificed after 21 days of treatment. Tumor nodules present in the peritoneal cavity were isolated and quantified according to their diameter and their total weight. Two independent assays were performed (n=8 mice per group). Gene Expression Analysis. For gene expression analysis, GTL-16 cells were cultured in serum-free media for 24 hours at approximately 40% confluence, prior to compound addition for 24 hours (Triflorcas: 3 \u00a5\u00ecM; SU112741 \u00a5\u00ecM). Total RNA was isolated from untreated or treated cells using the RNAeasy-Kit, processed with DNase (RNase-free DNase set), and purified on RNAeasy column (Qiagen). The quality of RNA was tested by using Picochip (Agilent Technologies). Gene profiling was done by the SuperArray Biosciences service using the RT2-profiler PCR array Stress and Toxicity Pathway Finder (96 genes). The data were imported into an Excel database and analyzed using the comparative cycle threshold method with normalization of the raw data to \u00a5\u00e2-actin. The results are presented as n-fold changes versus the values of untreated cells. The mean value was calculated from measurements of three independent biological samples. KINOMEscan. The activity of Triflorcas was assessed on a panel of 98 kinases through binding assays using the KINOMEscan service. The vehicle alone was used as negative control. The KINOMEscan is based on a competition binding assay that quantitatively measures the ability of a compound to compete with an immobilized active-site directed ligand. Kinexus. Cells were treated with Triflorcas (3 \u00a5\u00ecM) or vehicle for 72 hours. Protein extraction was performed as described by the manufacturer (Kinexus Bioinformatics, Vancouver, Canada). Samples were then analyzed by KINEXUS service using the phospho-array KPSS-10.1. FACS Analysis. Cells were treated with Triflorcas (3 \u00a5\u00ecM), SU11274 (1 \u00a5\u00ecM), or vehicle for 48 hours. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol and washed twice in PBS before treatment with RNase 100 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL. After staining with propidium iodide (50 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml), cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. NCI60 Screening. Triflorcas was screened by the NCI towards a panel of 60 cell lines. Cell sensitivity was assessed and results were expressed as TGI (Total Growth Inhibition), GI 50 (50% Growth Inhibition), and LC 50 (50% Lethal Concentration). Triflorcas action was evaluated towards data from public resources including CellMiner and COMPARE software. The COMPARE algorithm was used to search for compounds tested on the NCI60 panel, to uncover similar sensitivity profile to the Triflorcas. Luciferase constructs (Cignal Reporters; QIAGEN) were used for reporter assay studies and experiments were performed according to the manufacturers instructions. Bioinformatics Studies. To perform bioinformatics studies, we used three datasets downloaded from the NCI data resources to identify potential molecular signatures of NCI cancer cells sensitive to Triflorcas (last update August 2010, http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/mtargets/download.html). These databases included: \u00a1\u00b0Microarrays\u00a1\u00b1, which contain 74,700 measured targets derived from large scale experiments (Affymetrix U133 from Chiron, Affymetrix U95A from Novartis, Affymetric HUM6000 from Millenium Pharmaceuticals, and cDNA array data from Weinstein (NCI) and Brown & Botstein (Stanford) groups); \u00a1\u00b0all NCI dataset\u00a1\u00b1, which contains 12,845 measured targets derived from all small-scale measurements such as protein, mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation, mutations, SNPs, enzyme activity, metabolites, but excluding Microarray; \u00a1\u00b0only Protein subset NCI\u00a1\u00b1, which contains 333 measured targets derived from the NCI protein screening subset. The whole bioinformatics analysis involved three steps. First, to compare data, we used the developmental therapeutics program mean graph for the Triflorcas (five dose average data at GI 50 endpoint) to extract the sensitivity level of each cancer cell line tested. We then extracted the expression level of signals scored in each NCI cancer cell line. To allow comparison between Triflorcas cell sensitivity values and molecular target expression values, each value was normalized according to a standard normal distribution (standard score defined as: mean=0; standard deviation=1). Second, we scored the correlation existing between Triflorcas sensitivity values with that of each molecular target value by using a statistical correlation coefficient algorithm. The correlation coefficient spans values between ?1 and +1 and it permits to define five classes of correlation: strong negative correlation (?1 to ?0.5), weak negative correlation (?0.5 to 0), weak positive correlation (0 to 0.5), strong positive correlation (0.5 to 1), and no correlation (0). Only positive correlations (weak or strong) were included in these studies in order to extrapolate mainly putative targets of Triflorcas. Third, results were displayed in order to verify the strength of the global (whole cell lines) or specific (individual cell line) correlation. For this purpose, we defined a specific color code to highlight differences and similarities between the sensitivity profile of Triflorcas and changes in molecular targets. The color code was assigned according to the standard score above described. All values above 0 represent sensitivity of a given cell line to Triflorcas and are indicated by green squares. All values below 0 stand for no sensitivity and are represented by red squares. The same approach was applied to encode the expression of a given molecular target in each cell line: values above 0 were represented by green squares; values below 0 were represented by red squares. As not all cell lines screened for Triflorcas were included into the analysis of some molecular targets, no available data were represented by gray squares and were not taken into account for statistical analysis. Finally, a web-based application was designed in order to: 1) automatically convert sensitivity of Triflorcas and changes in molecular targets into a numeric format compliant; 2) score the potential degree of correlation between cells response to Triflorcas and the large set of molecular targets, using a statistical correlation coefficient algorithm; 3) sort potential molecular targets according to their correlation score; 4) display the result in a web browser to retrieve a short list of molecular targets highlighting possible molecular signatures. Luciferase Reporter Assay. GTL-16 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids that enable measuring the activity of p53, Smad2/3/4, AP-1 (as read of the MAP2K2-JNK pathway) or NFAT (as readout of the PKC-MARCKS pathway), and Elk1-SRF (as read of ERK signaling) promoters (Cignal Reporters, Qiagen). Transfection was performed by using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After 24 hours of transfection, cells were treated or not with Triflorcas (3, 10, and 30 \u00a5\u00ecM) for 48 hours, and then Luciferase activity was assessed. All Luciferase assays were performed using a dual Luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Supporting Information. Figure S1.

                "text": "Drug Resistance to Inhibitors of the Human Double Minute-2 E3 Ligase is Mediated by Point Mutations of p53, but can be Overcome with the p53 Targeting Agent RITA\tThe human double minute (HDM)-2 E3 ubiquitin ligase plays a key role in p53 turnover, and has been validated pre-clinically as a target in multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). HDM-2 inhibitors are entering clinical trials, and we therefore sought to understand potential mechanisms of resistance in lymphoid models. Wild-type p53 H929 MM and Granta-519 MCL cells resistant to MI-63 or Nutlin were generated by exposing them to increasing drug concentrations. MI-63-resistant H929 and Granta-519 cells were resistant to Nutlin, while Nutlin-resistant cells displayed cross-resistance to MI-63. These cells also showed cross-resistance to bortezomib, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and melphalan, but remained sensitive to the small molecule inhibitor RITA. HDM-2 inhibitor-resistant cells harbored increased p53 levels, but neither genotoxic nor non-genotoxic approaches to activate p53 induced HDM-2 or p21. Resequencing revealed wild-type HDM-2, but mutations were found in the p53 DNA binding and dimerization domains. In resistant cells, RITA induced a G 2/M arrest, up-regulation of p53 targets HDM-2, PUMA, and NOXA, and PARP cleavage. Combination regimens with RITA and MI-63 resulted in enhanced cell death compared to RITA alone. These findings support the possibility that p53 mutation could be a primary mechanism of acquired resistance to HDM-2 inhibitors in MCL and MM. Furthermore, they suggest that simultaneous restoration of p53 function and HDM-2 inhibition is a rational strategy for clinical translation. Introduction. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a key regulator of transcription factors and cellular proteins (1). Through its role in the poly-ubiquitination of target proteins and their subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation, this system influences angiogenesis, cell-cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis (2). Tumors exploit key segments of this pathway to enhance carcinogenesis and circumvent cellular surveillance strategies aimed at eliminating malignant cells. One example is over-expression of the E3 ligase Human Double Minute (HDM)-2 in 10% of human malignancies (3), depleting the tumor suppressor p53. This leads to loss of cell cycle check points and uncontrolled proliferation. A single nucleotide polymorphism within the HDM-2 promoter has also been reported to enhance HDM-2 expression and tumor formation (4). HDM-2 binds to the N-terminus of p53 to inhibit its transcriptional activity (5, 6), and ubiquitinates it for subsequent degradation (7, 8). This can be exploited therapeutically by agents such as Nutlin and MI-63 (Fig.1A), which bind the HDM-2 p53 binding site and prevent p53 ubiquitination (9, 10). Both have shown pre-clinical activity against mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and multiple myeloma (MM), where they stabilize p53 and enhance its pro-apoptotic effects (11?16). RITA (reactivation of p53 and induction of tumor cell apoptosis)(17)(Fig.1B), disrupts binding of p53 and HDM-2, but inhibits the interaction by binding to the HDM-2 binding site in p53 (18). Targeting the proteasome/E3 ligase system has recently become a focus in anti-cancer research with novel HDM-2 inhibitors (19). The advantage of inhibiting HDM-2 could be that specific inhibition of a single E3 ligase may reduce effects, such as neuropathy, which are seen in patients treated with bortezomib. Nutlin and MI-63 have been extensively studied in lymphoid malignancies (20, 21), and at physiologic concentrations their effects are due to disruption of the p53/HDM-2 interaction (22). One disadvantage of specific small molecule inhibitors is that resistance may be more likely to develop compared to genotoxic agents, since the latter may have a broader target range (23). Studies of mechanisms of innate or primary resistance to Nutlin and MI-63 have attributed this phenotype to p53 inactivation through HDM-X overexpression (24). Acquired, or secondary Nutlin resistance has been investigated in models of osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and melanoma (25, 26). These studies identified drug-resistant isolates, in some of which wild-type p53 was retained, while others were characterized by p53 mutations that impaired its DNA binding and transactivation. However, no data have elucidated how lymphoid malignancies acquire HDM-2 inhibitor resistance. This is especially important since these tumors show a lower rate of p53 inactivation than solid tumors (27), suggesting they may be better targets for this drug class. We therefore sought to examine the mechanisms responsible for MI-63 and Nutlin resistance by developing models that were insensitive to these pro-apoptotic drugs. Cell lines resistant to either agent demonstrated cross-resistance to the other, and were less sensitive to bortezomib, doxorubicin, cisplatin and melphalan, but not to RITA. Analysis of these cells showed enhanced p53 expression, while genomic sequencing revealed wild-type HDM-2 but mutated p53. Exposure of resistant cells to RITA induced cell cycle arrest and p53 transcriptional targets, supporting a restoration of p53 activity. Combination studies using RITA and MI-63 showed resensitization of resistant cells to MI-63. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that translation of HDM-2 inhibitors to the clinic for chronic treatment of patients with MCL and MM could result in selection of resistant clones with p53 point mutations. Importantly, it may be possible to circumvent resistance by using molecules that inhibit the p53/HDM-2 interaction and refold mutant p53 into a wild-type conformation. Materials and Methods. Reagents. HDM-2 inhibitors MI-63 and MI-219 were provided by Ascenta Therapeutics (Malvern, PA). Nutlin, doxorubicin and melphalan were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), RITA was from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI), bortezomib from Selleck Chemicals, LLC (Houston, TX), and cisplatin from the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Pharmacy (Houston, TX). Cell culture and generation of MI-63- and Nutlin-resistant cells. Wild-type p53 (wtp53) Granta-519 MCL and NCI-H929 MM cell lines were from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany) and American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)(Manassas, VA). Cell lines were validated in the M.D. Anderson Cell Line Validation Core Facility by short tandem repeat (STR) DNA fingerprinting (May 2012) using the AmpFSTR Identifiler kit (Applied Biosystems; Carlsbad, CA). The STR profiles were compared to known ATCC fingerprints, the Cell Line Integrated Molecular Authentication database (CLIMA) version 0.1.200808 (Nucleic Acids Research 37:D925-D932 PMCID: PMC2686526) and the M.D. Anderson fingerprint database. To generate resistance to MI-63 and Nutlin, cells were exposed to a concentration of each drug that induced a 25% proliferation inhibition for one-week, followed by a drug holiday. The drug dose was then increased every two weeks until lines were resistant to 10\u00a5\u00ecM of MI-63 or Nutlin. Cells were then maintained in drug-free media and the resistant phenotype was confirmed monthly. Experiments were performed in cells that had been drug-free for at least two weeks. Semi-quantitative and real-time PCR. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen; Valencia, CA), and cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR was performed on a StepOnePlus PCR analyzer (Applied Biosystems; Carlsbad, CA) using inventoried real time Taqman-FAM and GAPDH-VIC probes. Relative transcript expression (RQ) was determined using vehicle treated cells as a calibrator with the \u00a5\u00c4\u00a5\u00c4CT method. p53 and HDM-2 resequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Genomic DNA extraction kit (Qiagen). Exons, introns, and regulatory regions of p53 and HDM-2 were sequenced by the M.D. Anderson DNA Analysis Core Facility. Exons were amplified using custom PCR primers, and Sanger sequencing was performed on a 3730xl DNA Analyzer using BigDye\u00a2\u00e2 Terminator v3 (Applied Biosystems). Mutations analysis was performed using SeqScape \u00a2\u00e7 Software v2.5 (Applied Biosystems). Immunoblotting. Protein expression was measured by immunoblot analysis as previously described (28). Antibodies against p53 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), anti-p21, anti-PUMA, anti-NOXA, and anti-HDM-2 were from EMD Biosciences (Gibbstown, NJ), and anti-\u00a5\u00e2-actin was from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell cycle and cell death analysis. Cells were treated with drugs for 48-hours, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell cycle data were obtained on a BD Facs Canto II flow cytometer (Becton-Dickson; Franklin Lakes, NJ) using FlowJo v.7.6.1 (Tree Star, Inc.; Ashland, OR). Cell death was measured by staining with Annexin-V Pacific Blue and TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen). Cell proliferation assay. The WST-1 reagent (Roche Diagnostics; Indianapolis, IN) was used to determine the effects of chemotherapeutics (29). Median inhibitory concentration (IC 50) determinations were performed in 96-well plates in triplicate in 3 separate experiments performed on different days. Dose response curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad; La Jolla, CA) showing standard error of the mean with a log scale and IC 50 values calculated using the nonlinear regression competitive binding log IC 50 algorithm. Results. Generation of HDM-2 inhibitor resistant cells. To define the mechanisms through which MCL and MM could acquire HDM-2 inhibitor resistance, we exposed Granta-519 and H929 cells to increasing MI-63 and Nutlin concentrations. Median inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) for wild-type Granta-519 (Granta.WT) were 2.03\u00a5\u00ecM for MI-63 and 0.96\u00a5\u00ecM for Nutlin (Supplemental Table 1), and for NCI-H929 (H929.WT) the IC 50 was 3.30\u00a5\u00ecM and 3.54\u00a5\u00ecM, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Exposure of Granta-519 cells resistant to MI-63 (Granta.MI63R) or Nutlin (Granta.NutlinR) to MI-63 or Nutlin showed that both cell lines were insensitive to MI-63 and Nutlin (Fig.1C, 1E). Granta.MI63R showed IC 50\u00a1\u00afs of 60\u00a5\u00ecM for MI-63 and 59.75\u00a5\u00ecM for Nutlin, whereas Granta.NutlinR had an IC 50 of 47.3\u00a5\u00ecM for MI-63 and 44.75\u00a5\u00ecM for Nutlin (Supplementary Table 1). A similar result was seen in the H929 resistant cells (Fig.1D, 1F) where H929.MI63R had an IC 50 of 59.75\u00a5\u00ecM to MI-63 and 56.65\u00a5\u00ecM to Nutlin, whereas H929.NutlinR had an IC 50 of 55.80\u00a5\u00ecM for MI-63 and 47.60\u00a5\u00ecM to Nutlin (Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, enhancement of growth, particularly in H929.MI63R and H929.NutlinR, was noted in response to MI-63 or Nutlin (Fig.1D, 1F). Finally, we examined whether MI-63 and Nutlin resistance conveyed resistance to the small molecule RITA, which inhibits the p53/HDM-2 interaction by binding to p53 (18). Titration of RITA into Granta.MI63R and Granta.NutlinR cells revealed that they remained sensitive to RITA, though with a slightly increased IC 50 of 1.72 and 0.84\u00a5\u00ecM, respectively, compared to 0.272 \u00a5\u00ecM in Granta.WT cells (Fig.1G; Supplementary Table 1). Lastly, H929.MI63R and H929.NutlinR showed some resistance to RITA, although this was not statistically significant (p>0.05), with IC 50 values of 2.14\u00a5\u00ecM and 1.99\u00a5\u00ecM compared to 0.43\u00a5\u00ecM for H929.WT cells (Fig.1H; Supplementary Table 1). These data indicate that our models were heavily cross-resistant to HDM-2 inhibitors that bind the p53 binding site on HDM-2, but not as resistant to HDM-2 inhibitors targeting the HDM-2 binding site on p53. HDM-2 inhibitor-resistant cells demonstrate resistance against other therapeutics. We next considered whether MI-63 or Nutlin resistance could influence sensitivity to other anti-MCL (30) or MM (31) agents. Granta.MI63R and Granta.NutlinR cells displayed a slightly decreased sensitivity to doxorubicin, with an increase in the IC 50 to 15.54 and 15.73nM, respectively, compared to 8.01nM in Granta.WT cells (Fig.2A; Supplementary Table 2). H929.MI63R and H929.NutlinR also showed a weak decrease in doxorubicin sensitivity (Fig.2B; Supplementary Table 2). Since the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is effective against MCL and MM, Granta.MI63R and Granta.NutlinR cells were exposed to this agent, and showed a slight increase in resistance (Fig.2C; Supplementary Table 2). Similar results were found in H929.MI63R and H929.NutlinR cells (Fig.2D; Supplementary Table 2). To further investigate whether this HDM-2 inhibitor resistance conveyed resistance to other DNA damaging agents, we examined the activity of melphalan and cisplatin. Granta.MI63R and Granta.NutlinR cells exposed to cisplatin displayed increased resistance, with IC 50 values of 20 and 37.95\u00a5\u00ecM, respectively, compared to 4.02\u00a5\u00ecM for Granta.WT, representing a 4.9?9.4 fold increase in resistance (Fig.2E; Supplementary Table 2). H929.MI63R and H929.NutlinR cells treated with cisplatin had IC 50\u00a1\u00aes of 38.28 and 20.17\u00a5\u00ecM compared to 2.55\u00a5\u00ecM in the H929.WT cells (Fig.2F; Supplementary Table 2). Finally, treatment of Granta.MI63R and Granta.NutinR cells with melphalan resulted in IC 50 values of 2.2 and 1.5\u00a5\u00ecM, respectively, compared to 0.35\u00a5\u00ecM in Granta.WT cells (Fig.2G; Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, H929.MI63R and H929.NutlinR cells were resistant to melphalan, with IC 50 values of 4.77 and 2.59\u00a5\u00ecM compared to 0.78\u00a5\u00ecM in the H929.WT cells (Fig.2H; Supplementary Table 2), representing a 3.32- and 6.2-fold change. Resistance to HDM-2 inhibitors is mediated by p53 point mutations. Since MI-63- and Nutlin-insensitive cells showed cross-resistance to DNA damaging agents which work in part in a p53-influenced manner, we considered the possibility that these cells had acquired p53 mutations. Granta.MI63R or H929.MI63R cells were therefore exposed to Nutlin, the in vivo MI-63 analogue MI-219, or doxorubicin, and p53, HDM-2, and p21 levels were evaluated. Both resistant cell lines showed elevated p53 levels in the vehicle controls compared to WT counterparts (Fig.3A, 3B). When Granta.WT and H929.WT cells were exposed to Nutlin or MI-219, a robust p53 increase was seen, resulting in strong HDM-2 and p21 induction. In contrast, Granta.MI63R and H929.MI63R cells showed little if any p53 increase in response to Nutlin, MI-63, or doxorubicin. Importantly, neither doxorubicin nor the HDM-2 inhibitors induced HDM-2 and p21, indicating the absence of transcriptionally active p53. We probed the mutational status of p53 by sequencing, and analysis of Granta.MI63R cells identified two mutations, Q252Q and Y205Y. Q252Q is an exon 3 inactivating nonsense mutation, while Y205Y is an exon 5 inactivating missense mutation (Supplementary Table 3). H929.MI63R and H929.NutlinR cells both carried R175H and R248Q missense mutations within exons 4 and 6, respectively. Notably, HDM-2 sequencing revealed wild-type sequences throughout, indicating drug resistance was not mediated by mutation of the MI-63 or Nutlin binding site. RITA induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in resistant cells. The unanticipated sensitivity of Granta.MI63R and H929.MI63R cells to RITA suggested that RITA may have a mechanism of action beyond inhibiting the p53/HDM-2 interaction. Treatment of Granta.WT cells with RITA resulted in G 2/M cell cycle arrest compared to vehicle controls (Fig.4A, upper panel), whereas MI-63 and Nutlin induced a G 1 arrest. Granta.MI63R cells showed no cell cycle changes in response to MI-63 or Nutlin but RITA induced a strong G 2/M arrest (Fig.4A, lower panel). When H929.WT cells were studied, they also showed a G 2/M cell cycle arrest with RITA, whereas MI-63 induced a strong G 1 arrest with a sub-G 1 apoptotic peak. Nutlin also induced a sub-G 1 apoptotic peak and increased the G 2/M fraction (Fig.4B, upper panel). Similar to the Granta model, RITA treatment of H929.MI63R cells increased the proportion of plasma cells in G 2/M, whereas MI-63 and Nutlin had no effect (Fig.4B, lower panel). A novel insight into RITA\u00a1\u00afs function has recently been reported by Zhao et al (32) and Messina et al (33), noting RITA could rescue the apoptosis-inducing function of mutant p53. We therefore treated MI-63-resistant cells with RITA, and evaluated its effect on p53 down-stream targets. Exposure of Granta.MI63R cells to RITA initially decreased HDM-2 expression at 3-hours, and though a small rebound was noted at 12-hours, recovery did not occur to baseline levels, and almost full abrogation of expression was visible at 48?72-hours (Fig.4C). This HDM-2 decrease coincided with an increase in p53, and up-regulation of cleaved PARP. Two other p53-influenced apoptosis markers increased, including NOXA and p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). In contrast, in H929.MI63R cells, RITA up-regulated HDM-2 at 3?24-hours but, as in Granta cells, HDM-2 expression was virtually absent by 48?72-hours (Fig.4D). Similar to Granta.MI63R cells, p53 levels also increased in H929.MI63R cells as early as 6-hours, and RITA induced apoptosis in H929.63R cells in association with increased levels of NOXA and PUMA. RITA resensitizes HDM-2 inhibitor resistant cells to MI-63. Since RITA induced the expression of PUMA and NOXA, we explored whether RITA could restore p53 function and resensitize MI-63 resistant cells to HDM-2 inhibitors. Thus, we performed combination experiments with MI-63 and RITA, and examined whether the drug exposure sequence affected the outcome. Initial studies determined the activity of RITA and MI-63 for 24- and 48-hours as single agents in the MI-63-resistant cells. RITA had no effect on cell viability at 24-hours in Granta.MI63R or H929.MI63R cells (Fig.5A, 5B). However, treatment with RITA for 48-hours reduced cell viability by 50% in Granta.MI63R and H929.MI63R at 1.25 and 2.5\u00a5\u00ecM, respectively. Treatment with MI-63 had no effect at any of the concentrations used in the MI-63-resistant cells. To determine if the combination of MI-63 and RITA affected the resistant cells, RITA and MI-63 were titrated simultaneously, or cells were pre-treated with one for 24-hours, followed by addition of the other for 48-hours. When Granta.MI63R (Fig.5C, left panel) and H929.MI63R cells (Fig.5D) were treated simultaneously with RITA and MI-63, significantly greater reductions in viability were seen than with either agent alone (p<0.05 to vehicle)(Fig.5A and 5B). Sequencing studies showed that pre-treatment of Granta.MI63R (Fig.5C) or H929.MI63R (Fig.5D) cells with RITA followed by MI-63 resulted in resensitization to MI-63 (p<0.05 to vehicle and simultaneous addition). Interestingly, pre-treatment of Granta.MI63R cells with MI-63, followed later by RITA, showed no resensitization (p<0.05 to simultaneous addition), and indeed the combination was ineffective at reducing viability (Fig.5C). Studies in H929.MI63R cells showed qualitatively similar findings, particularly at lower concentrations, in that MI-63 followed by RITA induced less cell death than RITA alone (p<0.05 to simultaneous addition), supporting the possibility that this treatment sequence was antagonistic. Since simultaneous addition of clinically relevant analogues of RITA and MI-63 would be a convenient treatment approach for patients, we investigated the molecular effects of this regimen. RITA induced a modest amount of apoptosis in Granta.MI63R (Fig.6A) and H929.MI63R cells (Fig.6B), albeit to a lesser degree than in their wild-type counterparts. When MI-63 was used alone, as expected, it was ineffective against either, especially in comparison to the wild-type controls. However, when RITA and MI-63 were given simultaneously, the levels of apoptosis in the HDM-2 inhibitor-resistant models resembled those in the drug-naive, p53 wild-type counterparts (p<0.01). To evaluate if RITA was indeed restoring wild-type p53 function, Granta.MI63R and H929.MI63R cells were treated with RITA and MI-63, and expression of p21 and HDM-2 was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. RITA induced a 1.5-fold increase in p21, and a 1.25-fold increase in HDM-2 transcripts in Granta.MI63R cells (Fig.6C, 6E), while MI-63 alone failed to induce either. In contrast, the RITA/MI-63 combination increased p21 expression 3-fold, and HDM-2 nearly 2-fold. Similarly, in H929.MI63R cells, RITA induced a 2.5-fold increase in p21 and a 3-fold increase in HDM-2 (Fig.6D, 6F), whilst MI-63 failed at either. This failure was overcome by the addition of RITA and MI-63, resulting in a near 6-fold increase in p21, and a 5-fold increase in HDM-2. These data indicate that continuous exposure of MCL and MM models to the HDM-2 inhibitors MI-63 and Nutlin result in p53 point mutations as a mechanism of acquired drug resistance, and that RITA overcomes this resistance by restoring p53 function, thereby resensitizing cells to HDM-2 inhibitors. Discussion. Inhibitors of HDM-2, including Nutlin and MI-63/MI-219, have been used as tool compounds to establish HDM-2 as a target for therapy in MCL and MM. In anticipation that HDM-2 inhibitors will be evaluated in the clinic, and since both MCL and MM are characterized by the emergence of drug resistance, it is important to develop models of such resistance to identify the responsible mechanisms. Here we report that acquired MI-63 and Nutlin resistance can be mediated by the acquisition of p53 point mutations that inactivate its activity as a transcriptional activator. DNA damaging therapeutics such as anthracyclines and radiation frequently induce p53 mutations (34, 35), but HDM-2 inhibitors are not felt to induce genotoxic stress or DNA damage (9), making this finding somewhat unexpected. Additional studies will be needed to determine if these mutations are due to a low level of genotoxic stress, outgrowth of a sub-population of mutant p53 clones present in the background of the original wild-type p53 cells, or another mechanism. Cells with acquired resistance to one HDM-2 inhibitor were cross-resistant to another. Indeed, in cells resistant to MI-63 or Nutlin, further treatment with these inhibitors promoted cellular viability and growth (Fig.1). This may be because mutant p53 has been shown to enhance the development, maintenance, and metastatic spread of malignant cells (36?38). As HDM-2 can still ubiquitinate and degrade mutant p53 (7), HDM-2 inhibitors stabilize these p53 variants (25), and potentiate this gain of function, and potentially enhance proliferation. This suggests that the emergence of drug-resistant clones in patients could be associated with more rapid disease progression than is typically seen with other chemotherapeutics. Patients would therefore need to undergo regular measurements of their disease burden and its molecular characteristics to minimize this risk. While HDM-2 inhibitor-resistant models showed cross-resistance to other chemotherapeutics, they remained sensitive to RITA. MI-63 and Nutlin differ in that while both bind residues Phe-19, Trp-23, and Leu-26 of the HDM-2 domain that interacts with p53, MI-63 also interacts with Leu-22 (10, 39, 40). Despite this, MI-63 was still inactive against Nutlin-resistant cells, likely demonstrating that cross-resistance to HDM-2 inhibitors is dependent upon the target binding the same p53 HDM-2 binding site. RITA, on the other hand, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and down-stream p53 targets, suggesting RITA was restoring wild-type p53 function. Confirming this possibility, simultaneous treatment with MI-63 and RITA, and pre-treatment with RITA resensitized cells to MI-63 (Fig.5, ?,6)6) with p21 and HDM-2 induction. Originally, the mechanism of action of RITA was thought to be limited to wtp53 cells (18), but recent data indicate activity against mutp53 tumors (32, 33). Indeed, RITA restored the transactivation and transrepression functions of p53 mutants, and demonstrated selectivity for mutant p53 cells (32, 33). These findings explain the ability of RITA to overcome HDM-2 inhibitor resistance, and restore MI-63 sensitivity. One interesting observation was the antagonistic effect of exposing cells to MI-63 prior to RITA, and the ability of Nutlin and MI-63 to enhance the growth of resistant cells, which may be related to the function of p53 as a tetramer. Mutant p53 molecules can disrupt the function of wild-type p53 tetrameric complexes by direct binding, resulting in p53 heterodimers that cannot form functional tetramers (41). Addition of MI-63 first may increase mutant p53 expression in the resistant cells, and when RITA is then added, the number of mutant p53 molecules may be in excess, precluding the ability of RITA to convert them to wild-type function. This may result in antagonism as the balance of mutant p53 molecules can compete off the restored wild-type p53 function. In contrast, addition of RITA prior to MI-63 would allow conversion of mutant p53 to wild-type, and thereby change the balance of dimers, ultimately resulting in wild-type function. Inactivation of p53 through mutation is linked to decreased sensitivity to many chemotherapeutics (34, 35). Resequencing of HDM-2 and p53 in our models indicated the presence of point mutations solely within p53 DNA binding and dimerization domains. This explains the increased expression of p53, since mutant p53 has a longer half-life. Also, this helps to explain the failure of bortezomib, doxorubicin, melphalan, cisplatin, Nutlin, or MI-63/MI-219 to induce a significant amount of p21 and HDM-2. A previous study examining Nutlin-induced resistance in SJSA osteosarcoma cells found one population had acquired mutations in the p53 DNA binding and dimerization domain (25). Another population retained wtp53, but when the cells were rechallenged with Nutlin, they still underwent growth arrest (25). A more recent study which examined several cell lines with induced Nutlin resistance, including neuroblastoma, melanoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cells in which p53 mutation is infrequent, found that 80% harbored p53 mutations (42). This resistance was generated using similar methods to ours, and of particular interest was the finding that among the cell lines with induced resistance to varying genotoxic agents, only 7.14% had mutated p53 (42). This suggests that Nutlin class HDM-2 inhibitors are prone to induce p53 mutations within chronically exposed cells. All of the p53 mutations found in our cells were heterozygous, and this was also the case in the neuroblastoma Nutlin-resistant cells previously reported (26). Of particular interest was the fact that MI-63- and Nutlin-resistant H929 cells both carried the R248Q and R175H hot spot mutations, which are the most common p53 mutation in B-cell malignancies (43). The finding that both cells acquired the same mutations suggests the presence of mutated cells within the wild-type H929 cell line. These cells may be infrequent and not readily detectable, but following treatment with HDM-2 inhibitors their abundance may be increased. In contrast, the Granta-519 MI-63 and Nutlin resistant cells both had different mutations, suggesting these cells developed unique mutations not present within the wild-type parental cells, which was also observed in Nutlin resistant neuroblastoma cells (26). The HDM-2 inhibitor R05045337 is in phase I clinical trials targeting patients with solid tumors, and with acute and chronic leukemias. Outcomes from these and other trials, and especially analyses of primary samples obtained at baseline and at the emergence of drug resistance, will further delineate mechanisms of resistance in vivo. Until then, our data suggest that p53 mutations will play a prominent role and, importantly, provide a rationale for combining HDM-2 inhibitors with p53 reactivating agents such as RITA or PRIMA MET (44). These combinations may be of particular use in MCL, where ~15% of patients have mutated p53 with a median survival of only 1.3 years (45). Similarly, p53 mutations in MM fall in the 10?20% range (46), and increase with advanced disease (47). It is exciting to note the p53 reactivating agent APR-246 recently completed phase I clinical trials (48), and has shown activity in vitro in acute myeloid leukemia (49), and malignant melanoma (50). This indicates that MM and MCL patients with baseline or acquired p53 mutations could benefit from novel chemotherapies targeting HDM-2, and that APR-246 or RITA could help to restore wild-type p53 function, leading to enhanced cellular responses to therapy.

                "text": "Gefitinib Analogue V1801 Induces Apoptosis of T790M EGFR-Harboring Lung Cancer Cells by Up-Regulation of the BH-3 Only Protein Noxa\tTreatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with drugs targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), e.g., gefitinib and erlotinib, will eventually fail because of the development of secondary mutations such as T790M in EGFR. Strategies to overcome this resistance are therefore an urgent need. In this study, we synthesized a dozen of novel gefitinib analogues and evaluated their effects on L858R/T790M-EGFR harboring NSCLC cells, and reported that one of these gefitinib mimetics, N-(2-bromo-5-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl)-6-methoxy-7-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propoxy)quinazolin-4-amine (hereafter, V1801), triggered apoptosis of the NSCLC cells and overcame gefitinib-resistance in mice inoculated with NCI-H1975 cells. Though V1801 only moderately inhibited EGFR kinase activity, it markedly induced the expression of the BH3-only protein Noxa, and Noxa silencing significantly reduced V1801-induced apoptosis of NCI-H1975 cells. It is showed that V1801 interfered with the expression of the transcription factor c-Myc and the extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk) pathway. V1801 in combination with proteasome inhibitor bortezomib exerted enhanced cytotoxicity in NCI-H1975 cells possibly due to potentiated induction of Noxa expression. These data indicate that gefinitib analogues with weak EGFR inhibitory activity may overcome drug-resistance via activation of BH-3 only pro-apoptotic proteins, and V1801 may have therapeutic potentials for NSCLC. Introduction. Lung cancer is the one of the most frequent neoplasm worldwide, comprising 17% of the total new cancer cases and 23% of the total cancer deaths in males [1]. Treatment of lung cancer is determined by the histologic type and stage at diagnosis, and mainly includes surgery, platinum doublet therapy, radiation therapy and targeted therapy, with an only 15% of five-year overall survival rate for all stages combined [2]. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting agents including EGFR-specific antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib, benefit a proportion of patients especially those never-smoke and of Asian origin [3]?[5]. However, treatment with gefitinib and erlotinib will eventually fail because of the development of acquired drug resistance resulting from amplification of the MET proto-oncogene or the threonine-to-methionine amino acid substitution at position 790 (T790M) of EGFR, which is detected in 50% of clinically resistant patients [6], [7]. The T790M mutation in EGFR affects the gatekeeper residue in the catalytic domain of the kinase that weakens the interaction of the inhibitors with the target [6]. Recent studies show that T790M mutation is a \u00a1\u00b0generic\u00a1\u00b1 resistance mutation that will reduce the potency of any ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor [8]. In T790M EGFR-harboring cells, inhibition of EGFR by currently available second-generation EGFR-TKIs is not sufficient to physiologically prevent the emergence of cells that are still dependent on EGFR signaling [9]. Therefore, strategies to overcome EGFR TKI resistance remain practical needs in order to prolong survival time of patients with lung cancer. Evading apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer, and targeting apoptosis has become a cancer therapeutic strategy [10]. The critical apoptosis regulators, B cell CLL/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) and its family proteins, can be divided into pro- and anti-apoptotic members, and the pro-apoptotic proteins can be subdivided into proapoptotic proteins and BH3-only subfamilies, based on their structural similarity of various Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains [11], [12]. Noxa is a BH3-only protein that is implicated in apoptosis associated with DNA damage, hypoxia or exposure to proteasome inhibitors [13]?[15]. Expression of Noxa in Hela cells strongly promotes cell apoptosis, while blocking the endogenous Noxa suppresses programmed cell death [16]. Accumulation of Noxa sensitizes apoptosis by binding to and neutralizing the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, leading to release and subsequent activation of Bax (BCL2-associated X protein) or BAK (BCL2-antagonist/killer) from Bax/Bak-Mcl-1 complex [13], [17], [18]. In addition to its role in apoptosis, Noxa also regulates diverse cellular functions in autophagic cell death and metabolism [19], [20]. Apoptosis-associated Noxa activation is primarily achieved through transcriptional upregulation by p53, E2F1, HIF1\u00a5\u00e1, c-Myc, ATF3, and extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk) pathway [14]?[16], [21]?[23]. However, the identity of the critical BH3-only proteins and the mechanism of their action following treatment by diverse apoptotic stimuli remain to be fully resolved. To screen for the agents to overcome gefitinib-resistance, we here synthesized a number of novel gefitinib structural analogues and tested their inhibitory effects on EGFR kinase activity and proliferation of NCI-H1975 cells [24] which harbor L858R/T790M-EGFR [6], [7], [25] and wild-type MET without genomic amplification [26] that are resistant to gefitinib and erlotinib. We found a gefitinib mimetic, N-(2-bromo-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-6-methoxy-7-(3- (piperidin-1-yl)propoxy)quinazolin-4-amine (hereafter, V1801), moderately inhibited EGFR kinase activity but significantly suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in T790M EGFR-harboring non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and in vivo. We further showed that up-regulation of Noxa underlain V1801's activity on NSCLC cells. Materials and Methods. Agents. The gefitinib analogues (Table 1) were synthesized by our chemistry group, and the N-(3-chloro-4-fluoro-phenyl)-7-methoxy-6-(3-morpholin-4-ylpropoxy) quinazolin-4-amine (gefitinib) was purchased from J&K Chemical Ltd. All the compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to make stock concentration of 10 mM and kept at ?20\u00a1\u00c6C. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiahiazozy1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) was purchased from Sigma. Bortezomib was attained from Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. The Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) Apoptosis Detection kit was obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). Antibodies. The antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-\u00a5\u00e2-Actin (Sigma); anti-Casp-9 (C9), anti-Casp-8 (1C12), anti-Casp-3 (3G2), anti-PARP, anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK, anti-EGFR (L858R), anti-STAT3, anti-phospho-STAT3 (Cell signaling); anti-c-Myc, anti-Noxa, anti-phospho-EGFR (Y1173), anti-pAKT and AKT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-ERK2 (Abcam); anti-rabbit or anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce). Detection was performed by using a Chemiluminescent Western detection kit (Cell Signaling). Cell culture. The lung cancer cell lines NCI-H1975, A549 and HCC827 were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection. A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco/BRL, Grand Island, NY), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin. NCI-H1975 and HCC827 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. RNA preparation and RT?PCR. The total RNA of the cells was isolated using the TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen) and the phenol-chloroform extraction method according to the manufacturer's instruction. Total RNA (2 \u00a5\u00ecg) was annealed with random primers at 65\u00a1\u00c6C for 5 min. The cDNA was synthesized using a 1st-STRAND cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas). For PCR amplification, primers are as follows: Actin, forward primer: 5\u00a1\u00c7-CTCCTCCTGAGCGCAAGTACTC\u00a1\u00c7-3\u00a1\u00c7, reverse primer: 5\u00a1\u00c7-TCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATC\u00a1\u00c7-3\u00a1\u00c7; Puma, forward primer: 5\u00a1\u00c7-GTCCTCAGCCCTCGCTCT-3\u00a1\u00c7; reverse primer: 5\u00a1\u00c7-CTAATTGGGCTCCATCTCG-3\u00a1\u00c7; Bim, forward primer: 5\u00a1\u00c7-GCCCCTACCTCCCTACAGAC-3\u00a1\u00c7; reverse primer: 5\u00a1\u00c7-ATGGTGGTGGCCATACAAAT-3\u00a1\u00c7; Bcl-xl, forward primer: 5\u00a1\u00c7-GGTGGGAGGGTAGAGTGGATGGT-3\u00a1\u00c7; reverse primer: 5\u00a1\u00c7-GGAAAGCGTAGACAAGGAGATGC-3\u00a1\u00c7; Mcl-1, forward primer: 5\u00a1\u00c7-CACGAGACGGTCTTCCAAGGCATGCT-3\u00a1\u00c7; reverse primer: 5\u00a1\u00c7-CTAGGTTGCTAGGGTGCAACTCTAGGA-3\u00a1\u00c7; Noxa, forward primer: 5\u00a1\u00c7-AAGAAGGCGCGCAAGAAC-3\u00a1\u00c7; reverse primer: 5\u00a1\u00c7-CGTGCACCTCCTGAGAAAAC-3\u00a1\u00c7. Western blot assay. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM Na 3VO 4, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, complete protease inhibitor cocktail) and cleared by centrifugation to obtain whole-cell lysates. Equal amounts of samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with antibody indicated [27]. Preparation of cytoplasmic fractions. For the detection of cytochrome c released from the mitochondria, cytoplasmic fractions were collected from NCI-H1975 cells after incubation with 0.1 mg/ml digitonin for 3 min at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in Cytosol Lysis Buffer (0.01% digitonin, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, protease inhibitors cocktails in 1\u00a1\u00bfPBS at pH 7.4). After centrifugation, aliquots of the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) and the pellet containing the mitochondria were analyzed by Western blotting. Assessment of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Cells were treated with V1801 or gefitinib for indicated concentrations and time points. Cell proliferation was determined using MTT assay. Cell viability was estimated by trypan blue dye exclusion [27]. Externalization of phosphatidylserine was tested using an Annexin V/PI Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) according to manufacturer's instruction. After staining with Hoechst 33258 at 10 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml for 10 min, cell death was assessed by a fluorescence microscope (Leica). In vitro EGFR kinase assays. In vitro kinase inhibitory ability was determined using the ADP-Glo\u00a2\u00e2 Kinase Assay Kit and EGFR Kinase Enzyme System (Promega), following the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA assays. Using HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol, cells were transfected with 100 nM double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides. The siRNA sequences were 5\u00a1\u00c7-GGUGCACGUUUCAUCAAUU-3\u00a1\u00c7 (Noxa siRNA1), 5\u00a1\u00c7-AACUUCCGGCAGAAACUUC-3\u00a1\u00c7 (Noxa siRNA2), and 5\u00a1\u00c7-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3\u00a1\u00c7 (negative control (NC) siRNA), 5\u00a1\u00c7-CAGAAATGTCCTGAGCAAT-3\u00a1\u00c7 (c-Myc siRNA1), 5\u00a1\u00c7-AAGGTCAGAGTCTGGATCACC-3\u00a1\u00c7 (c-Myc siRNA2). Clonogenic assay. After incubation with V1801 (3 \u00a5\u00ecM) or gefitinib (3 \u00a5\u00ecM) for 12 h, a soft-agar colony assay was performed. To this end, trypsinized cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and low-melting-point 0.3% agarose (Amresco, Solon, OH) and subsequently overlaid onto a solidified layer of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 0.6% agarose in 35 mm plate (5,000 cells/plate) in triplicate. After 2 weeks, the colonies were fixed in 90% ethanol and stained with 0.005% crystal violet (Sigma). The colony forming units with more than 100 cells were counted using a light microscope [28]. Combination index. The interaction between compounds was quantified by determining the combination index (CI) calculated by the Chou?Talalay equation [29], [30]. The general equation for the classic isobologram is given by: CI=(D)1/(Dx)1+(D)2/(Dx)2. Where Dx indicates the dose of one compound alone required to produce an effect, (D)1 and (D)2 are the doses of compounds 1 and 2, respectively, necessary to produce the same effect in combination. From this analysis, the combined effects of the two compounds can be summarized as follows: CI<1 indicates synergism; CI=1 indicates additive effect; and CI>1 indicates antagonism. Murine models. All animal studies were conducted according to protocols approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, with the approval ID of AEC2011030205. All mice used in this study were bred and maintained in a specific pathogen-free environment. NCI-H1975 cells (2.5\u00a1\u00bf10 6) were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of nude mice. When tumor reached a palpable size, animals were randomized into 3 groups (n=11 for each group) and treated with V1801 (30 mg/kg/day), gefitinib (30 mg/kg/day) or vehicle control for 3 weeks. Animals were sacrificed when tumors reached 2 cm or if the mice appeared moribund to prevent unnecessary morbidity to the mice. At the time of the animals' death, tumors were excised; cells were separated and lyzed for Western blotting using anti-Noxa antibody and anti-Actin antibodies. Noxa expression was then quantified by densitometry analysis and normalized against Actin expression. Statistical analysis. All experiments were repeated at least three times and the data were presented as the mean\u00a1\u00beSD unless noted otherwise. P values less than 0.05 indicate statistical significance. Results. Effects of gefitinib mimetics on lung cancer cells and EGFR kinase activity. In this work, fourteen gefitinib analogues were synthesized by exchanging the positions of the C5 and C6 substituents and varying the C4-amino functionality of the quinazoline core of gefitinib, and their effects on NCI-H1975 cells were evaluated using gefitinib as a control (Table 1). Among these compounds, V1801, V1802 and V1807 were found to exhibit much more potent cytotoxicity against NCI-H1975 cells than gefitinib, and V1801 is the most potent one, whose IC50 value of 3 \u00a5\u00ecM is more than three folds lower than that of gefitinib (Table 1). Generally, introduction of a trifluoromethylaniline moiety to the C4 position of the quinazoline core is an effective manner of improving the cytotoxicity. A bromine substituent at the C2' position was found to be a suitable modification for higher activity (V1801 vs. V1802, V1805 and V1808). In addition, the piperidine moiety at the terminal of C6-substituent of these compounds is also superior by comparison with the corresponding morpholine, cyclohexane, azido, triazole and tetrazole functionalities. Using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, we showed that V1801 displayed significant inhibitory effects against the proliferation of NCI-H1975 (Fig. 1a) and wild type EGFR-expressing A549 (Fig. 1b) cells in a dose-dependent fashion. By trypan blue exclusion analysis, we found that V1801 rapidly reduced viable NCI-H1975 (Fig. 1c) and A549 (Fig. 1d) cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We assessed V1801's effects on colony formation activity of the cells, and reported that as compared to gefitinib or vehicle control, V1801 drastically inhibited the clonogenic activity of NCI-H1975 cells (Figs. 1e and 1f). We tested the effects of these gefitinib analogues on EGFR and showed that V1801, V1802 and V1805 exerted moderate inhibitory activity on EGFR kinase activity (Table 1). V1801 had an IC 50 on EGFR much higher than that of gefitinib (701.9 nM vs 11.2 nM; Table 1), indicating that the new modifications made in analogue V1801 are workable but less superior for inhibiting EGFR kinase activity. By Western blot analysis in NCI-H1975 cells, both gefitinib and V1801 failed to down-regulate phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR) (Fig. 1g), while in gefitinib-sensitive HCC827 cells, gefitinib but not V1801 induced de-phosphorylation of p-EGFR (Fig. 1h). These results indicate V1801 might induce cell apoptosis via a mechanism independent of EGFR signaling pathway inhibition. V1801 induces apoptosis of NSCLC cells in a caspases-dependent manner. We next tested whether or not V1801 induces apoptosis of the cells. By Hoechst 33258 staining, it was showed in NCI-H1975 cells V1801 caused chromatin condensation and fragmentation which are typical apoptotic nuclear morphological changes (Fig. 2a). An annexin V/propidium iodide (PI)-staining and flow cytometry assays confirmed that treatment with V1801 for 24 h induced apoptosis in NCI-H1975 and A549 cells (Fig. 2b). By Western blot analysis, V1801 treatment was found to result in a marked increase in the active form of caspase-9, caspase-8 and caspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in NCI-H1975 cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion (Fig. 2c) and in A549 cells (Fig. 2d). When NCI-H1975 cells were pre-treated with a pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone (z-VAD.fmk; 20 \u00a5\u00ecM) for 1 h followed by treatment with V1801 at 3 \u00a5\u00ecM for 12 h, V1801-induced apoptosis was suppressed (Fig. 2e), indicating that the activation of caspase cascade is essential for V1801-induced apoptosis in gefitinib-resistance cells. V1801 up-regulates Noxa in NSCLC cells. To elucidate the mechanism of action of V1801, its effects on the expression of antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-xl and Mcl-1) and proapoptotic proteins (Noxa, Puma and Bim) of Bcl-2 family were tested in NSCLC cells with RT-PCR analysis. Interestingly, we found that V1801 strongly increased the expression of Noxa in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). We then evaluated the effect of V1801 on protein level of Noxa, and found that treatment with V1801 at 3 to 4 \u00a5\u00ecM for 24 h markedly up-regulated Noxa in NCI-H1975 cells (Fig. 3b). In NCI-H1975 cells treated with V1801 at 3 \u00a5\u00ecM for 3 to 6 h, Noxa was drastically increased (Fig. 3c). In A549, HCT116, BGC823 and SGC7901 cells, treatment with V1801 at 3 to 6 \u00a5\u00ecM for 24 h also up-regulated Noxa (Fig. 3d). However, gefitinib failed to up-regulate Noxa in these cell lines (Figs. 3a through 3d), indicating that these two compounds have totally distinct mechanisms in inducing apoptosis of lung cancer cells. Up-regulation of Noxa is required for V1801-induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells. To evaluate its role in V1801-induced apoptosis, Noxa was silenced by specific siRNA (Fig. 3e), and the cells upon V1801 were analyzed by Annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometry. We found that knockdown of Noxa significantly attenuated V1801-induced apoptosis of NCI-H1975 cells (Fig. 3f), indicating that up-regulation of Noxa is essential for V1801-induced apoptosis. However, Noxa silencing could not completely abrogated V1801-induced cell apoptosis (Fig. 3f), suggesting that other factors might be involved in programmed cell death triggered by this gefitinib analogue. Noxa can directly bind Mcl-1 and competitively release Bim or Bak from this apoptosis antagonist, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and initiation of programmed cell death [18], [31]. We performed co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays in V1801-treated NCI-H1975 cells, and found that V1801 but not gefitinib enhanced Mcl-1-Noxa binding affinity (Fig. 3g). We then examined the subcellular localization of cytochrome c by Western blot, while the expression of cytochrome C was quantified by densitometry analysis and normalized against GAPDH or Hsp75. We found that in NCI-H1975 cells treated with V1801 (3 \u00a5\u00ecM) but not gefitinib (3 \u00a5\u00ecM) for 24 h, cytochrome c was partially translocated from mitochondria to cytosol (Fig. 3h and i). These results illustrate that increased expression of Noxa mediates apoptosis induced by V1801 through mitochondria pathway. Investigating the mechanisms underlying V1801-induced Noxa up-regulation. Studies have shown that the p53, c-Myc and E2F1 can transcriptionally increase Noxa expression via direct binding to Noxa promoter [32]. We tested the expression of these transcription factors, and reported that only c-Myc was upregulated in NCI-H1975 cells treated with V1801 at 3 \u00a5\u00ecM for 3 h (Fig. 4a). To determine its role in V1801-induced Noxa up-regulation and NCI-H1975 cell apoptosis, c-Myc was silenced by specific siRNA (Fig. 4b). We found that c-Myc silencing slightly suppressed V1801-caused Noxa expression (Fig. 4c) and programmed cell death in NCI-H1975 cells (Fig. 4d). To confirm these results, the c-Myc inhibitor 5-(4-ethyl-benzylidene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one (10058-F4) [33] was employed to inhibit c-Myc transcription function. The results showed that 10058-F4 partially repressed V1801-induced Noxa up-regulation (Fig. 4e) and cytotoxicity in NCI-H1975 cells (Fig. 4f). Previous studies showed that cisplatin can up-regulate Noxa in Erk dependent fashion, and inhibition of Erk by siRNA or small compound inhibitor U0126 markedly attenuated cisplatin-induced cell death as well as Noxa expression [15]. We tested the effects of V1801 on Erk, and found that in NCI-H1975 cells treated with V1801 at 3 \u00a5\u00ecM for 12 h, the phospho-Erk (p-Erk) was increased (Fig. 5a). Treated with V1801 for 24 h also down-regulated the phospho-signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) but not phospho-Rac-serine/threonine-protein kinase (p-Akt) (Fig. 5a). It was showed that U0126 could attenuate V1801-induced Noxa expression (Fig. 5b) and slightly (p=0.06) reduced V1801-induced apoptosis of NCI-H1975 cells (Fig. 5c). In mantle-cell lymphoma, Noxa activation is required for the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib induced apoptosis [13]. We tested the combined effect of V1801 and bortezomib on NCI-H1975 cells and found that bortezomib at 10 to 15 nM significantly enhanced V1801 (2 \u00a5\u00ecM)-caused inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 5d). An analysis of the combination index (CI) [29], [30] indicated that the CI values were less than 1, indicating that these two agents could exert synergistic effects on NSCLC cells. At molecular level, we showed that treatment of NCI-H1975 cells with V1801 and bortezomib resulted in enhanced up-regulation of Noxa and activation of Casp-3 and cleavage of PARP (Fig. 5e). However, the up-regulation of p-Erk induced by V1801 was slightly attenuated by bortezomib (Fig. 5e). In vivo anti-tumor efficacy of V1801 on xenograft mouse model. We tested the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of V1801. To do this, nude mice were subcutaneously inoculated into the right flank with 2.5\u00a1\u00bf10 6 NCI-H1975 cells in 0.1 ml PBS. When the tumors reached a palpable size, the mice were randomized into 3 groups (n=11 for each group) and oral administration with V1801 (30 mg/kg/day), gefitinib (30 mg/kg/day) or vehicle control for 3 weeks. Intriguingly, we found that V1801 significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to vehicle control or gefitinib (P<0.05) (Figs. 6a through 6c). Animals were euthanized when they were treated for 3 weeks and the tumor samples were isolated and imaged (Fig. 6c). Proteins were extracted from tumor samples and Western blot assay was conducted. We found that in samples from mice treated with V1801, the expression of Noxa was up-regulated as compared to that in samples separated from vehicle or gefitinib control mice (Fig. 6d and e). These results demonstrate that administration of V1801 exhibits tremendous therapeutic potentials. Discussion. EGFR is a cell-surface receptor activated in more than half of patients with NSCLC, and this activation can be the result of protein over-expression, increased gene copy number, or genetic mutations [2]. Gefitinib's anti-lung cancer effects attribute to its binding to the adenosine triphosphate binding site in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, thereby inhibiting EGFR kinase activity [3], [5], [34], [35]. Although many patients initially respond to gefitinib, resistance and tumor recurrence eventually develop. To overcome such drug resistance, novel mutant-selective EGFR kinase inhibitors against EGFR T790M were reported [36], and 4-pyrrylamino quinazolines as new gefitinib analogues were synthesized [37]. In this study, we design, synthesize and evaluated a number of novel quinazoline derivatives by exchanging the positions of the C5 and C6 substituents and varying the C4-amino functionality of gefitinib, and report that compound V1801 having a trifluoromethyl group at the C5'-position and a bromine at the C2'-position of the aniline moiety substituted at the C4 position of quinazoline core overcomes gefitinib resistance via up-regulation of Noxa, suggesting a novel strategy to fight against NSCLC with EGFR T790M mutation. The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis constitutes one of the main safeguards against tumorigenesis, and the Bcl-2 family includes the central players of this pathway that regulate cell fate through the control of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Therefore, Bcl-2 family antagonists have been developed for cancer therapy [38]. To inhibit Mcl-1 pro-survival function, occlusion of Mcl-1 hydrophobic groove by BH3-only proteins represents an effective strategy [39]. Noxa belongs to the BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family and is able to interact with Mcl-1, leading to initiation of apoptosis signals [31], [40], [41]. Compared with the parental compound gefitinib, V1801 is a relatively weak EGFR inhibitor which bears a much more potent cytotoxicity in T790M EGFR-harboring NCI-H1975 cells (Table 1). These results suggest that V1801 may have \u00a1\u00b0off-target\u00a1\u00b1 effects in gefitinib-resistance NSCLC cells. We carry out experiments to investigate the mechanisms of action of V1801 by measuring the expression of Bcl-2 family members including Noxa, Puma, Bim, Bcl-xl and Mcl-1, and found that in NCI-H1975 and A549 cells upon V1801, Noxa is up-regulated at an early stage (3 h) at both mRNA and protein levels (Figs. 3a through 3d). In colon, gastric cancer cells and melanoma cells, V1801 also induces up-regulation of Noxa (Fig. 3d), suggesting that this mechanism is valid in a spectrum of cancer cells. While the expression of Mcl-1 in NCI-H1975 cells is not affected by V1801 treatment, Mcl-1-Noxa interaction is enhanced (Figs. 3a and 3g). Consequently, cytochrome C partially translocates from mitochondria to cytosol (Fig. 3h and i). These results indicate that V1801 can induce Noxa expression and trigger intrinsic apoptotic pathway, leading to activation of effector caspases and cleavage of PARP (Fig. 2). Interestingly, V1801 can also activate caspase-8 (Fig. 2), demonstrating that V1801 also activates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and the mechanisms of action of this compound in inducing apoptosis are complicated and warrant further investigation. The expression of Noxa is regulated by transcription factors HIF-1\u00a5\u00e1, E2F-1 and p53 [32]. Recent studies show that in a variety of tumor cell types, the induction of Noxa by proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is directly dependent on the oncogene c-Myc [22]. Indeed, c-Myc not only regulates those genes capable of promoting cell growth and metabolism, but also activates apoptosis initiators [42]. c-Myc amplifies mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and activating pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as BH3-only proteins [43]. Here we report that c-Myc protein is up-regulated by V1801 treatment in NSCLC cells (Fig. 4a). However, c-Myc silencing by siRNA only slightly but not significantly (p=0.14) attenuates V1801-caused programmed cell death of NSCLC cells (Fig. 4d). Given that Erk pathway can mediate Noxa up-regulation [15] and Erk itself has pro-apoptotic function [15], [44], [45], we test the effect of V1801 on Erk expression and report that this gefitinib analog increases p-Erk, but Erk inhibition only slightly (p=0.06) suppresses V1801-induced apoptosis of H1975 cells (Fig. 5c). The results also suggest the complexity of the mechanisms of action of this compound in inducing apoptosis of lung cancer cells. In myeloma cells, bortezomib inactivates p-Erk and synergistically potentiates the apoptotic effects of a novel compound 6-O-Angeloylplenolin [46]. Interestingly, we show that while bortezomib significantly enhances V1801-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 5d) and up-regulation of Noxa (Fig. 5e) on NCI-H1975 cells, it antagonizes V1801-caused p-Erk activation (Fig. 5e). These results indicate that bortezomib, as a multi-target agent, may increase Noxa expression through other unidentified mechanism which warrants further investigation, and combined use of V1801 and bortezomib may have therapeutic potential in gefinitib-resistance NSCLC cells. The in vivo studies show that in nude mice inoculated with NCI-H1975 cells, treatment with V1801 at 30 mg/kg per day significantly inhibits tumor growth, while gefitinib at the same dosage does not show therapeutic benefit (Fig. 6a through 6c). V1801 also up-regulates Noxa in vivo (Fig. 6d), and V1801-treated mice have smaller tumors and higher Noxa expression compared to those treated with vehicle control or Gefitinib (Fig. 6e). Therefore, our data indicates that gefinitib analogs with weak EGFR inhibitory activity can overcome TKI-resistance via activation of BH-3 only pro-apoptotic proteins, and V1801 represents a potential new therapeutic agent for patients with NSCLC.

                "text": "Genetically defined subsets of human pancreatic cancer demonstrate unique in vitro chemosensitivity\tPurpose. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth cause of death from cancer in the western world. Majority of patients present with advanced unresectable disease responding poorly to most chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapy for PC might be improved by adjusting it to individual genetic profiles. We attempt to identify genetic predictors of chemosensitivity to broad classes of anticancer drugs. Experimental Design. Using a panel of genetically defined human PC cell lines, we tested gemcitabine (anti-metabolite), docetaxel (anti-microtubule), mitomycin C (alkylating), irinotecan (topoisomerase I inhibitor), cisplatin (crosslinking), KU0058948 (Parp1 inhibitor), triptolide (terpenoid drug) and artemisinin (control). Results. All PC cell lines were sensitive to triptolide and docetaxel. Most PC cells were also sensitive to gemcitabine and MMC. The vast majority of PC cell lines were insensitive to cisplatin, irinotecan, and a Parp1 inhibitor. However, individual cell lines were often sensitive to these compounds in unique ways. We found that DPC4/SMAD4 inactivation sensitized PC cells to cisplatin and irinotecan by 2?4 fold, but they were modestly less sensitive to gemcitabine. PC cells were all sensitive to triptolide and 18% were sensitive to the Parp1 inhibitor. P16/CDKN2A inactivated PC cells were 3?4 fold less sensitive to gemcitabine and MMC. Conclusions. Chemosensitivity of PC cells correlated with some specific genetic profiles. These results support the hypothesis that genetic subsets of pancreatic cancer exist, and these genetic backgrounds may permit one to personalize the chemotherapy of PC in the future. Further work will need to confirm these responses and determine their magnitude in vivo. Introduction. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the USA and leads to an estimated 227,000 deaths per year worldwide (1). 5-year survival rates for PC are estimated to be less than 5% because of its advanced stage at diagnosis, aggressive growth and resistance to most anticancer drugs (2). Despite this, systemic chemotherapy is generally used to treat patients with PC. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog and historically the standard first-line choice for the treatment of advanced PC. The median overall survival of single agent gemcitabine is approximately 6 months with a response rate of 10% in patients with metastatic disease (3). Recently, the combination of biweekly administered fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) was studied in a phase III trial yielding a response rate of 31.6% and a median overall survival of 11.1 months (4). De Jesus-Acosta, et al also demonstrated a substantial survival benefit with gemcitabine, docetaxel and capecitabine (GTX) chemotherapy in patients with metastatic and locally advanced PC, and achieved a median survival of 11.3 and 25.0 months, respectively (5). Recent studies in human PC have revealed complex genetic alterations in its pathogenesis and progression. Jones et al (6) sequenced 20,661 protein-coding genes in 24 PCs and found alterations in KRAS (>95%), p16/CDKN2A (95%), TP53 (50?75%) and DPC4/SMAD4 (55%), the four high-frequency PC driver genes (6?8). Recent studies reported that inactivation of DPC4/SMAD4 was associated with poorer prognosis in patients with surgically resected PC and a widely metastatic phenotype in unresected patients (9, 10). Chemoresistance of tumor cells can be enhanced by mutations in oncogenes, loss of tumor suppressors or dysregulation of genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle, cell proliferation, signal transduction, angiogenesis or apoptosis (11, 12). Using genetic alterations to predict chemotherapeutic response may prove to be one of the most important concepts in the therapy of human cancer. The field of targeted therapy is rapidly expanding with more than 800 new agents developed, 140 of which are under clinical evaluation. For example, Her2/neu is closely associated with aggressive clinical behavior and poor outcome (13), and trastuzumab was the first Her2-targeted therapy approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of metastatic Her2-mutated patients (14). Parp1 is a critical enzyme involved in cell proliferation and repair of single stranded DNA breaks and multiple PARP1 inhibitors have been tested clinically with encouraging results, particularly in triple negative BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer (15). Extrapolation of this finding to other BRCA1/2 defective cancers may not necessarily and directly follow (16). The cytogenetic lesion of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is the Philadelphia chromosome, which arises from a balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 (17). This translocation produces a constitutively active tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL) (18) for which imatinib mesylate, a first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is a potent inhibitor (19). However, although numerous studies have addressed chemosensitivity testing in a variety of malignancies, yet there are few studies in PC (20?22). We wished to test the hypothesis that the genetic mutations in PC might predict chemotherapeutic response. For these initial studies, we selected a panel of broadly acting anticancer agents including, an anti-metabolite drug (gemcitabine), an anti-microtubule drug (docetaxel), an alkylator (mitomycin C), a topoisomerase I inhibitor (irinotecan), a crosslinking agent (cisplatin), a Parp inhibitor (KU0058948), a terpenoid (triptolide) and a negative control drug (artemisinin). We tested this panel of drugs for cytotoxicity using a panel of genetically defined human PC cells. We also verified some initial findings using DPC4/SMAD4 and TP53 isogenic pairs of cancer cells. The preliminary data demonstrate that genetic subsets of PC correlate with in vitro chemosensitivity, and these genetic backgrounds may be useful for personalizing chemotherapy of PC patients in the future. Materials and Methods. Human PC cell lines, human pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line, human DPC4/SMAD4 isogenic PC cell lines, human TP53 isogenic colon cancer cell lines and cell culture. Thirty-four human pancreatic cancer cell lines used in this study were isolated from the tumor samples of patients in Departments of Pathology and Oncology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (Supplementary Table S1). Among them, nineteen cell lines were used for the Discovery Screen and ten cell lines were used for the Prevalence Screen of the original PC sequencing study (6). The sequences of 23,219 transcripts representing 20,661 protein-coding genes were determined, and somatic mutations identified in the discovery and prevalence screen, homozygous deletions, and SAGE gene expression data have been published in detail elsewhere (6). Twelve of the patients contributing samples to this study had a family history of the disease, defined as having at least two first degree relatives affected with pancreatic cancer. The use of human tissue was approved by the local IRB (John Hopkins University). All human pancreatic cancer cell lines were cultured in MEM medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Gibco), 100 U/ml Penicillin and 100 ug /ml Streptomycin. An HPV transfected normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line (HPDE), generously provided by Dr. Ming-Sound Tsao, was also analyzed. Apart from slightly aberrant expression of p53, molecular profiling of this cell line has shown that expression of other proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are normal (23). The HPDE cell line was grown in keratinocyte serum free-media (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and recombinant epidermal growth factor. Pa01C and Pa02C parental cell lines were both generated from liver metastases of PC patients, which both had homozygous deletions of DPC4. Pa01C and Pa02C cells were stably transfected with either a cDNA expression plasmid to overexpress DPC4 (pcDNA3.1-DPC4) or an empty plasmid (pcDNA3.1Mock) using the Attractene transfection agent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The Pa01C and Pa02C derivative isogenic cells were both analyzed as single clones. All of the genetically complemented clones express DPC4, while the control cells do not (data not shown). TGF\u00a5\u00e2 pathway activities were tested for these isogenic pairs using a previously reported luciferase assay (24).These cell lines were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 100 U/ml Penicillin, 100 ug /ml Streptomycin, and 0.35 mg/mL G418 sulfate (Mediatech, Manassas, VA). Supplementary Table S2 summarizes the DPC4/SMAD4 isogenic cell lines. The parental colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116, SW48, and RKO were from ATCC. All the isogenic cell pairs for TP53 were created with genetic knockout / knockin method, as was previously reported (25). These cell lines were cultured in McCoy\u00a1\u00afs 5A medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 100 U/ml Penicillin and 100 ug /ml Streptomycin. Supplementary Table S3 shows the characteristics of TP53 isogenic cell lines. All cells were maintained at 37 \u00a1\u00c6 in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2. Preparation of anticancer drugs. Triptolide, docetaxel, MMC, cisplatin, irinotecan and artemisinin were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO). Gemcitabine was obtained from Net Qem (Research Triangle Park, NC). Parp1 inhibitor (KU0058948) was synthesized in Dr. Vogelstein\u00a1\u00afs lab. Artemisinin (an anti-malarial drug) was selected as a negative control drug since it possessed no known anticancer activity. The eight drugs were dissolved in DMSO (triptolide, docetaxel, cisplatin, irinotecan and artemisinin) or PBS (MMC and gemcitabine), stock solutions of 10mM were made and they were stored at ?80 \u00a1\u00c6. In vitro cell growth assay for drug screening. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 3,000 cells per well using standard culture media (described above). Edge wells of the 96-well plate were filled with 1 X PBS. After overnight growth, media were removed and 200ul of medium with drug was added into each well. Drugs were serially diluted to desired final concentrations with medium containing 10% serum and each dose had 6 replicate wells. Cells incubated in the medium with the vehicle DMSO or PBS served as controls. Plates were incubated with drugs for 72 hours. Media were aspirated and each well was washed with PBS 3 times to remove cellular debris. 100ul of ddH 20 was added to each well and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour to lyse the cells. 100ul of deionized H 2O containing 0.15% of SYBR green I solution (Molecular Probes, cat # S7567) were added to wells and mixed 10 times. Fluorescence was measured by using BMG FluoStar Galaxy (BMG Labtechnologies, USA)(excitation at 480nm and measurement at 520nm) (25). Human PC cell lines and HPDE were tested initially at the following doses: 0nM, 1nM, 10nM, 100nM, 1uM, 10uM and 100uM. Positive drug effects and isogenic cells drugs were tested using final concentrations: 0nM, 1nM, 3nM, 10nM, 30nM, 100nM, 300nM, 1uM, 3uM and 10uM in three independent experiments (18 replicate wells totally per dose). Gene set enrichment analysis for gene expression data (Supplementary Materials and Methods).  Statistical analysis. IC50 values were calculated by fitting sigmoid dose-response curves with GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). IC50 distributions were compared by genetic status (mutations, deletions or both) and family history status with Wilcoxon rank sum tests. A drug response was defined as an IC50 value below the median or below the highest IC50 that did not exceed 10000 (this happened for drugs where more than 50% of cell lines had IC50 values greater than or equal to 10000). The relationship between response and genetic status was summarized with an odds ratio from a logistic regression model and Fisher\u00a1\u00afs exact test. When comparing the IC50 values between different drugs or to fold change in pathway activity, Spearman\u00a1\u00afs rank based correlation was used. IC50 values between isogenic pairs were compared with a paired Student\u00a1\u00afs t test. Chemosensitivity correlation analysis of clustered cell lines was examined with heatmaps and a network map, which is a visual depiction of how cell lines cluster based on whether the Spearman correlation of the within-cell line standardized IC50 values between a pair of cell lines was 0.65 or higher. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 and R (version 2.13.1). Due to the exploratory nature of the study, p-values are not corrected for multiple comparisons and are included for descriptive purposes only. Results. Substantial variation of PC cell lines to broad classes of chemotherapeutic agents. We screened 29 genetically defined PC cell lines with the seven broad classes of anticancer drugs listed above. Pancreatic cancer cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of the drugs in 6 replicate wells and IC50 values calculated (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S4, S5). Most pancreatic cancer cell lines were sensitive to gemcitabine, triptolide, docetaxel and MMC. The majority of pancreatic cancer cell lines were insensitive to cisplatin, irinotecan, Parp1 inhibitor and the negative control drug. Among the generally sensitive drugs, some cell lines were notably less sensitive (Figure 2A, 2D). For example, with gemcitabine, the vast majority of cell lines were sensitive with IC50s in the single digit nanomolar range, whereas three cell lines (Pa09C, Pa08C and Pa43C) were significantly less sensitive (IC50s: 40 to 60 nM). Similarly, for MMC, most of cell lines were sensitive with IC50s under 50 nM, whereas five cell lines (Pa18C, Pa07C, Pa02C, Pa113C and Pa19C) were substantially resistant. Surprisingly, among the generally ineffective drugs (Figure 1), individual cell lines were uniquely sensitive (Figure 3). For example, with cisplatin, most cell lines were quite insensitive, whereas a few (Pa18C, Pa21C and Pa228C) had relatively lower IC50 values (100 to 200 nM). Similarly, for irinotecan, three cell lines (Pa21C, Pa37C and Pa227C) demonstrated IC50 values less than 200nM, and for the Parp1 inhibitor, six cell lines (Pa03C, Pa01C, Pa11C, Pa104C, Pa221C and Pa227C) had IC50s less than 200nM. In summary, among the sensitive drugs, outlier PC cell lines were more resistant, while among the resistant drugs, unique cell lines were more sensitive. DPC4/SMAD4 inactivation sensitized PC cells to cisplatin and irinotecan but reduced their sensitivity to gemcitabine. We attempted to explain the variation in drug response noted above by correlating it with the genetic status of these lines. We checked all the somatic mutations and homozygous deletions which existed in the 19 PC cell lines included in the discovery screen and the 10 PC cell lines included in the prevalence screen (Supplementary Table S1) (6). We attempted to correlate drug responses to genotype (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S1, S2), considering each gene as either mutated only (mut), deleted only (del), mutated or deleted combined (md), or wildtype (wt). We initially focused on DPC4/SMAD4 (Supplementary Table S6, S7). PC cells with DPC4 homozygous deletions were modestly (2?fold) more sensitive to cisplatin compared to those with wild type genotype (P=0.04) (Supplementary Figure S1A and Supplementary Table S6). Cells with the deletion of any of four SMAD Pathway genes (SMAD3, SMAD4, TGF\u00a5\u00e2R2 or TGF\u00a5\u00e2R3) were 2.2-fold more sensitive to cisplatin (P=0.02) (Supplementary Table S6). In logistic regression analysis, comparisons of DPC4 deleted or SMADPath gene deleted or SMADPath gene defective (mutated or deleted) PC cells to wildtype cells treated with cisplatin confirmed this finding (odds ratios: 11.93, 15.07 and 7.56, P values: 0.01, 0.001 and 0.05, respectively) (Supplementary Table S7). One concern about this study is that of multiple comparisons. Accordingly, to confirm these findings, we constructed isogenic cell lines from Pa01C and Pa02C with or without homozygous DPC4 deletions. With cisplatin, we found that IC50 values of DPC4 deficient cell lines for cisplatin were 1.8-fold and 1.2-fold lower than for DPC4-containing cell lines (Figure 5A and Supplementary Table S8). This was less significant in another isogenic cell line pair derived from Pa02C, but this cell line showed lower TGF\u00a5\u00e2 signaling even when DPC4 was present (Supplementary Figure S3A). Because all the pairs of isogenic cells had different levels of TGF\u00a5\u00e2 pathway signaling (Supplementary Figure S3A), we attempted to correlate the cisplatin IC50 values with TGF\u00a5\u00e2 pathway activities in these cells. Our results confirmed that IC50 values of cisplatin were positively correlated with TGF\u00a5\u00e2 activity (r=0.86, 95%CI: 0.39 to 0.97, P=0.007), although this relationship is largely driven by the two cell lines with highest TGF\u00a5\u00e2R activity (Supplementary Figure S3B and Supplementary Table S9). The analysis of expression data showed that cytotoxicity of cisplatin was closely positively associated with MAP3K12 (an activator of the SAPK/JNK pathway), MAPK11 (most closely related to p38 MAP kinase), and MAP4K2 (involved in activation of MAP3K1/MEKK1) (Supplementary Table S10). PC cells with DPC4 defects (mutations or deletion combined) were 4.5-fold more sensitive to irinotecan than those with wildtype DPC4 (P=0.04) (Figure 4A and Supplementary Table S6). In logistic regression analysis, comparison of DPC4 defective cells to wildtype cells treated with irinotecan produced an odds ratio of 8.64 and a P value of 0.02, and when only DPC4 deleted cells were compared to wildtype cells, a P value of 0.02 was obtained (Supplementary Table S7). In order to verify these findings, we tested the pairs of DPC4 isogenic cell lines with irinotecan. We found IC50 values of DPC4 deficient cell lines were 1.2-fold and 1.7-fold lower than those of DPC4 complemented cell lines (Figure 5B and Supplementary Table S8). Correlation analysis for IC50 values and TGF\u00a5\u00e2 pathway activities was not significant (P=0.067) (Supplementary Table S9) We tested two pairs of DPC4 isogenic cells for possible synergy between cisplatin and irinotecan at a constant ratio of 1:1 with simultaneous treatment. The combination indices (CI) were calculated using CompuSyn (26). Simultaneous treatment with the two drugs resulted in antagonistic interactions with DPC4 defective cells and synergistic interactions in DPC4 complemented clones at ID50, but these cell lines all showed antagonistic or additive interactions at ID75 (Supplementary Table S11). Despite the lack of correlation between DPC4 status and gemcitabine response in the panel of PC cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1C, S1E), we tested the DPC4 isogenic cell lines with gemcitabine, and found that DPC4 defective cells were about 2-fold less sensitive than wildtype cells (P=0.058 and 0.033) (Figure 5C and Supplementary Table S8). We made the correlation analysis for IC50 values and TGF\u00a5\u00e2 pathway activities in these isogenic cells. Our results confirmed that gemcitabine IC50s were negatively correlated with TGF\u00a5\u00e2 pathway activities (P=0.015) (Supplementary Figure S3C and Supplementary Table S11). Chemotherapeutic effects of triptolide and a Parp1 inhibitor were related to TP53 inactivation. PC cells with TP53 defects were 2.3-fold more sensitive to triptolide than wildtype TP53 cells, P=0.04 (Figure 4B and Supplementary Table S6). We confirmed these results in logistic regression analysis, P=0.02 (Supplementary Table S7), and confirmed a modest effect (1.5?2.7 fold) using three pairs of TP53 isogenic colon cancer cells (1.4?2.7 fold) (p<0.05) (Figure 5D and Supplementary Table S12). PC cells with defective TP53 were 4.3-fold more sensitive to Parp1 inhibitor than those with wildtype TP53 alleles, P=0.04 (Figure 4C and Supplementary Table S6). In this analysis, only three cell lines were wildtype, and the response of TP53 defective cell lines was clearly bimodal with one highly resistant population (IC50s: > 10,000 nM), and a second variably sensitive population (IC50s: 20 to 4,000 nM). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that a subset of TP53 defective cancer cells were more sensitive to the Parp1 inhibitor (an odds ratio of 11.93 for TP53 mutation versus wild type, P=0.02, and a p value of 0.01 for TP53 mutation or deletion versus wild type) (Supplementary Table S7). We investigated possible explanations for this effect (Supplementary Table S13, S14), and identified a possible association between sensitivity and wild type P16 status, although this was not statistically significant. We attempted to confirm these findings using three pairs of TP53 isogenic colon cancer cell lines (Supplementary Figure S3D and Supplementary Table S12), however the opposite effect was seen, possibly because the different genetic and cellular backgrounds of the PC cells and the colon cancer cell lines. P16/CDKN2A inactivation made human PC cells less sensitive to gemcitabine and MMC. PC cells with P16 homozygous deletions demonstrated approximately 3.1-fold higher IC50 values for gemcitabine than those with wildtype P16 (P=0.04) (Supplementary Figure S2A and Supplementary Table S6), although this was less significant when mutations and deletions were considered together (P=0.11) (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since wildtype alleles for DPC4 and P16 were each associated with gemcitabine sensitivity, we also compared PC cells having both wildtype P16 and DPC4 with those having both P16 and DPC4 defects, and found cells with wildtype DPC4 and P16 were 4-fold more sensitive to gemcitabine than DPC4 and P16 defects, although this difference did not achieve statistical significance (P=0.15) (Supplementary Figure S2D). PC cells with wildtype P16 alleles were 3.8-fold more sensitive to MMC than those with either P16 mutation or deletion (P=0.04) (Figure 4D and Supplementary Table S5). We confirmed this in logistic regression analysis (an odds ratio of 0.19 for P16 defects versus wildtype, P=0.05) (Supplementary Table S7). We attempted to explain the variation in drug response of the P16 defective cancer cells, but were unable to identify cooperating mutations in other genes (Supplementary Table S15). Other findings in the anticancer drug screening. We selected the anti-malarial drug, artemisinin, as a negative control drug, and the majority (88.2%) of cancer cells demonstrated no response, as expected. To our surprise, three PC cell lines showed sensitive responses with IC50s less than 300 nM (Figure 3D).We examined the SAGE expression data in attempt to explain these results. We noted significant the lack of expression of P16, p15 and a series of mitogen-activated protein kinase genes in the sensitive lines (Supplementary Table S16). Other drug response-genotype associations, drug response-gene expression profile correlations and DPC4/SMAD4, TP53 or P16/CDKN2A status-gene expression profile correlations are presented in Supplementary Results (Supplementary Table S6, S7, S10, S16, S17, S18, S19, S20, S21 and Supplementary Figure S4, S5). With regard to gemcitabine sensitivity, we were unable to correlate it with quasimesenchymal subtype (27) or ZEB1/2 expression (data not shown). Cluster analysis for anticancer drug sensitivities. We also analyzed the chemosensitivity without consideration of the genetics using cluster analysis. Using an evolutionary cluster analysis, it appears that the drug pattern is dominant over the cell line clustering. As expected, sensitive drugs clustered on the right branch, and insensitive drugs clustered on the left branch (Figure 6A). We found that cisplatin with irinotecan, and gemcitabine with Parp1 inhibitors had similar drug response profiles. Some PC cell lines clustered together forming several groups with similar drug response profiles for 8 drugs (Figure 6B). For example, Pa01C, Pa03C and Pa21C in a triangle network showed similar drug responses, and similar different gene expression profiles that distinguished them from other PC cell lines (Supplementary Table S22). Other attempts to identify genes responsible for the clustering were not successful. Discussion. Personalized chemotherapy based on the pattern of genetic alterations and gene expression in a tumor can, in theory, identify drugs to which the tumor will be sensitive as well as those unlikely to provide a therapeutic response. Comprehensive germline and somatic changes in patients and their cancers can now be determined at a reasonable cost in 2012. However, the bioinformatics to translate these data to chemoprediction is years behind. Our study attempts to fill this gap. In our study, we screened a set of genetically defined PCs to determine whether there were correlations between genetic and transcriptomic profiles and drug sensitivities. We found that somatic mutations or homozygous deletions of DPC4/SMAD4, TP53 and P16/CDKN2A genes correlated with in vitro drug responses, though the differential effects were not pronounced. Additional studies will be necessary to determine whether these correlations can be reproduced in pre-clinical animal models and in patients. We identified an association between DPC4/SMAD4 defects and sensitivity to cisplatin and irinotecan in the initial panel of PC cell lines, and confirmed these effects using isogenic cell lines. The observation that cisplatin cytotoxicity was correlated with alteration of MAP kinases indicates that cytotoxic mechanism of cisplatin in PC cell may be partly linked to noncanonical TGF\u00a5\u00e2 pathways. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways by TGF\u00a5\u00e2 depends upon the cell type, often in a DPC4-independent manner (28). For irinotecan, we observed that DPC4 inactivation sensitized PC cells to this drug. DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) is essential in metazoans for the relaxation of DNA supercoiling by forming Top1 cleavage complexes (Top1cc) (29), and Top1 inhibitors can stabilize Top1cc and Top1-associated DNA damage (30). TGF\u00a5\u00e2 signaling influences cellular proliferation through inhibition of G1/S transition by inducing expression of cyclin kinase inhibitors such as P15, P21 and P27 while TGF\u00a5\u00e2 signaling repressing c-Myc expression (31). Consistent with these prior studies, we observed downregulation of P15/CDKN1B and upregulation of CDCA4 and CDC2L6 with DPC4 inactivation in our panel of pancreatic cancer cells (Supplementary Table S19 and Supplementary Figure S5A, S35B). In a recent study, Bornstein et al (32) reported increased genomic instability in both normal head and neck tissues and HNSCC from HN-mice with selective inactivation of DPC4/SMAD4 in head and neck epithelium, which correlated with downregulated expression and function of genes encoding proteins in the Fanconi anemia/Brca DNA repair pathway. Under inactivation of DPC4, cell cycle checkpoint arrest is reduced, thereby increasing genomic instability and resulting in apoptosis, which may contribute to sensitivity of DNA damaging drugs in PC cells. In our study, we also found that wildtype DPC4 was a sensitive factor for gemcitabine. PCs are represented by distinct genetic subtypes with significantly different patterns of failure (9). So it may be valuable to determine DPC4 status at initial diagnosis and stratify patients into personalized chemotherapy. We found substantial variation in Parp1 inhibitor sensitivity among PC cell lines, where sensitivity correlated with inactivated TP53. All TP53 wild type PC cells were highly resistant to the Parp1 inhibitor while there was considerable variation among TP53 inactivated cells. This variation was not correlated with the type of p53 mutation or mutation status at a second gene (Supplementary Table S13). Nor could we explain these results through differences in expression (Supplementary Table S14). TP53 downregulates homologous recombination (HR) either directly (33) or by interacting and/or regulating HR-related proteins, such as Rad51 (34). In this sense, TP53 inactivation results in increased exacerbated spontaneous or damage induced HR (35, 36). TP53-deficient mice exhibit high HR frequency at different developmental stages (37) and TP53 mutations correlate with elevated recombination rates (38, 39). Moreover, TP53 preferentially suppresses both spontaneous and DSB-induced nonconservative intrachromosomal HR between imperfect homologous sequences (ICHR), susceptible of generating gross rearrangements such as deletions, duplications or inversions (40). In our study, it was observed that RAD51 and other HR genes were upregulated in TP53 inactivated PC cells, which indicated a high HR frequency in TP53 deficient PC (Supplementary Table S20 and Supplementary Figure S5C). The correct balance between desirable and undesirable repair is attained by the finely tuned HR regulation of TP53, as evidenced by the fact that both excessive and defective HR are associated with cancer predisposition and resistance to therapeutic drugs (41).Therefore, TP53 inactivation may result in an imbalance between desirable and undesirable repair because of the lack of proper regulation by TP53 in HR. Some studies report that cells lacking PARP1 also show a hyper-recombinogenic phenotype (an increased frequency of HR) (42?44), which has also been observed in mice using the pun assay (45). We propose that TP53 inactivation may have a synthetic lethality with Parp1 inhibitor in PC cells because TP53 controls the fidelity of Rad51-dependent HR and represses aberrant processing of replication forks after stalling at unrepaired DNA lesions. In our study, we also found that the sensitivity of Parp1 inhibitor was related to expression profiles of some DNA damage and repair pathway genes (ERCC3, RAD17, SUMO1, MUTYH, CRY1, HSP90B1, CDC37, RXRA, USP5) in (Supplementary Tables S10, S14, S16). Triptolide covalently binds to human XPB (also known as ERCC3), a subunit of the transcription factor TFIIH, and inhibits its DNA-dependent ATPase activity, which leads to the inhibition of RNA polymerase II?mediated transcription and likely nucleotide excision repair (46). In our study, we found that the expression level of ERCC3 was upregulated in triptolide sensitive PC cells and triptolide was more sensitive to PC cells with TP53 inactivation (Supplementary Table S16 and Supplementary Figure S4A). This indicates that ERCC3 may exert a synthetic lethality with TP53. Recent reports also indicate that triptolide causes PC cell death in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis via inhibition of HSP70 which can inhibit apoptosis in cancer cells by attenuating cytosolic calcium and stabilizing lysosomes (47, 48). In our study, it was found that elevated expressions of HSF1 and HSPA9 were related to the triptolide sensitivities in PC cell lines (Supplementary Table S16). Additionally, we showed that PC cells with P16 inactivation were less sensitive to gemcitabine and MMC. These findings are consistent with those of Halloran, who reported that gemcitabine combined with adenoviral-mediated reintroduction of P16 greatly enhanced cytotoxicity in Panc-1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (49). P16/CDKN2A is a tumor suppressor and plays a pivotal role in regulating the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint (50). Gemcitabine and MMC can both cause DNA damage by incorporation of nucleoside analogs or production of crosslinks and wild type P16 may facilitate the process for cycle checkpoint arrest and apoptosis in PC cells. Cell cycle checkpoints are important in cellular response to DNA damage by arresting the cell cycle to provide time for repair and by inducing transcription of genes that facilitate repair (51). This is consistent with a clinical trial which suggested that the ability of cells to progress into the S phase after gemcitabine and radiation treatment was the key factor in radiosensitization (52). A recent study indicated that the polymorphic genotypes of p16 were associated with significantly shorter time to tumor progression and poorer response to therapy (53). Our analysis of expression data also showed that cytotoxicity of gemcitabine was closely associated with the expression of genes regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, DNA repair, tumor suppressor gene and anticancer drug metabolism pathway (Supplementary Table S16). So we hypothesize that mutations and deletions in cell cycle genes such as P16 may modulate the response to treatment with gemcitabine or MMC-based chemotherapy. We also analyzed the chemosensitivity data by ignoring the genetics. For active drugs, we found uniquely insensitive lines, and among inactive drugs, including even the control drug, we found unique sensitive lines. By using cluster analysis, we found that some anticancer drugs have similar drug response profiles for PC cell lines, and some PC cell lines clustered together forming several groups with similar drug response profiles. Consistent with the findings of Collisson, et al (27), this provides evidence that functional subsets of PC exist, however, despite our best effort, we were unable to correlate clusters in Figure 6B with specific genetic defects. Drugs that closely cluster may indicate that they target a common pathway or downstream effector. In vitro studies, such as ours, have limitations. Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain why purified malignant cells may exhibit sensitivities in vitro that do not extrapolate to in vivo tumors. Malignant cells may possess biologic properties that are lost in tissue culture. Alternatively, the resistance to systemic therapies in PC patients might also be partly explained by inefficient drug delivery to malignant cells, because stromal microenvironment may create a hypovascular penetration barrier that impairs effective chemotherapeutic delivery (54). Further, the degree of genetic heterogeneity of a tumor is also likely to be an important determinant of therapeutic outcome (55), the reconstruction of tumor clonal architectures and the identification of early driver mutations may provide more robust biomarkers and therapeutic approaches (56). In a conclusion, we screened broad classes of anticancer drugs for their antiproliferative properties in a panel of human PC cell lines. These results suggest that genetic subsets of pancreatic cancer exist, and that many are significantly correlated with chemosensitivity to specific agents. These genetic subsets may be valuable for personalizing PC chemotherapy in the future. Statement of Translational Relevance. The costs of next generation sequencing are rapidly decreasing, and the $1,000 genome is near. This \u00a1\u00b0new tool\u00a1\u00b1 may permit more rational and effective use of chemotherapeutic drugs. We studied the chemosensitivity of a broad panel of genetically defined pancreatic cancers to seven chemotherapeutic drugs with distinct mechanisms of cytotoxicity. We found seven different gene-drug correlations in vitro. Additional work will be needed to confirm and determine the magnitude of these effects in vivo. These findings provide an initial framework for personalized chemotherapy of this nearly lethal malignancy. Supplementary Material. Supplementary Figures. Supplementary Methods, Figure Legends.

Non?small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is categorized into various histologic subtypes that play an important role in prognosis and treatment outcome. We investigated the antitumor activity of motesanib, a selective antagonist of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and Kit, alone and combined with chemotherapy in five human NSCLC xenograft models (A549, Calu-6, NCI-H358, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H1650) containing diverse genetic mutations. Results. Motesanib as a single agent dose-dependently inhibited tumor xenograft growth compared with vehicle in all five of the models (P<0.05). When combined with cisplatin, motesanib significantly inhibited the growth of Calu-6, NCI-H358, and NCI-H1650 tumor xenografts compared with either single agent alone (P<0.05). Similarly, the combination of motesanib plus docetaxel significantly inhibited the growth of A549 and Calu-6 tumor xenografts compared with either single agent alone (P<0.05). In NCI-H358 and NCI-H1650 xenografts, motesanib with and without cisplatin significantly decreased tumor blood vessel area (P<0.05 vs vehicle) as assessed by anti-CD31 staining. Motesanib alone or in combination with chemotherapy had no effect on tumor cell proliferation in vitro. Conclusions. These data demonstrate that motesanib had antitumor activity against five different human NSCLC xenograft models containing diverse genetic mutations, and that it had enhanced activity when combined with cisplatin or docetaxel. These effects appeared to be mediated primarily by antiangiogenic mechanisms. Background. Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer death and the second most frequent cause of new cancer cases in the United States [1]. The majority of these cases are non?small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [2], which comprises nonsquamous carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and squamous cell carcinoma [3]. Survival among patients with advanced NSCLC is poor with currently recommended doublet chemotherapy regimens [3,4]. Targeted therapies, and particularly those that inhibit angiogenesis, are being actively explored as alternative treatment options [5]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a proangiogenic cytokine, is frequently overexpressed in NSCLC tumors, and its overexpression is associated with increased microvessel density [6-8]. Furthermore, high VEGF expression has been associated with nodal metastasis, poor prognosis, and reduced survival in NSCLC [6,7,9]. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF-A, has been shown to improve overall survival when administered with carboplatin/paclitaxel [10] and to prolong progression-free survival in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin [11] in patients with nonsquamous histology. There is increasing evidence that NSCLC histologic subtype is useful for predicting patient outcome and clinical benefit from treatment with cytotoxic and argeted cancer therapies [12-14]. In a recent retrospective analysis of the phase 3 E4599 study of bevacizumab combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel in nonsquamous NSCLC, median overall survival was 14.2months in the bevacizumab arm compared with 10.3months in the control arm among patients with adenocarcinoma (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.69 [0.58?0.83]). In contrast, among patients with large cell carcinoma, median overall survival was 10.0months in the bevacizumab arm and 8.7months in the control arm (hazard ratio [95% CI], 1.15 [0.60?2.24]) [15]. Prognosis and response to targeted treatment also appear to be influenced by a number of characteristic NSCLC driver mutations that are thought to be responsible for the initiation and maintenance of the malignancy. The most common are somatic mutations in the KRAS, EGFR, and ALK genes but mutations in other genes, including BRAF, occur as well [16]. It is well established that EGFR mutations can significantly predict patient outcome and response to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor gefitinib in Asian patients with advanced NSCLC [17-20]. The potentially predictive value of other NSCLC driver mutations is still under investigation [21,22]. The emerging significance of both histologic subtype and presence of mutations in NSCLC suggests that testing of novel targeted therapies in preclinical models of varying histologies and genetic backgrounds may be a critical step in the evaluation process. Motesanib is a small-molecule antagonist of VEGF receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3; platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR); and Kit [23]. In tumor xenograft models, including models of thyroid cancer and breast cancer, oral administration of motesanib, alone or in combination with chemotherapy resulted in tumor regression and inhibition of angiogenesis [23-26]. In phase 1 and phase 2 studies in advanced solid tumors including advanced nonsquamous NSCLC, motesanib as a monotherapy and combined with chemotherapy has shown evidence of antitumor activity [27-31]. The objective of the present study was to investigate the antitumor activity of motesanib as monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin or docetaxel in five human NSCLC xenograft models of varying histologic subtypes and genetic backgrounds, with the hypothesis that combined treatment would improve antitumor activity over that of single-agent treatment. Motesanib had antiangiogenic and antitumor activity against all five human NSCLC models and had enhanced antitumor activity when combined with cisplatin or docetaxel chemotherapy. Results. Expression of VEGFR2 and effect of motesanib on NSCLC tumor cell proliferation. Western blot analysis failed to detect expression of total or phosphorylated VEGFR2, one of the molecular targets of motesanib, in A549, Calu-6, NCI-H358, NCI-H1299, or NCI-H1650 cells in full-serum media, following serum starvation, or after treatment with recombinant human VEGF (50ng/mL) for 5minutes. In contrast, cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) expressed total VEGFR2 in all three culture conditions and phosphorylated VEGFR2 in full-serum conditions which was further increased after stimulation with recombinant human VEGF (Figure 1A). Microarray analyses showed that A549, Calu-6, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H1650 tumors expressed similar levels of VEGF mRNA; and that A549, Calu-6, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H1650 tumors expressed VEGFR1, 2, and 3 mRNA (data not shown). A549 was the only line to express PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1, and none of the cell lines expressed PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 or Kit (data not shown; NCI-H358 cells were not tested). In vitro assays demonstrated that 5\u00a5\u00ecM motesanib had no effect on the proliferation of A549, Calu-6, NCI-H358, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H1650 tumor cells but inhibited the proliferation of endothelial cells (IC 50, 10 nM) (Figure 1B). In the same experiment, the cytotoxic chemotherapy agent docetaxel inhibited proliferation of each of the cultured cell lines, including HUVECs with IC 50 values in the low nanomolar range (Figure 1B). These data do not support a direct antitumor effect of motesanib on NSCLC cells. Effect of single-agent motesanib on human NSCLC tumor growth. The effect of motesanib on NSCLC tumor growth in vivo was assessed using A549, Calu-6, NCI-H358, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H1650 subcutaneous tumor xenografts. Treatment with motesanib significantly inhibited growth in each of these models. In the A549, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H1650 xenograft models, motesanib demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on tumor growth. In mice with established A549 tumors, all three doses of motesanib tested (7.5, 25, and 75mg/kg BID) significantly inhibited tumor growth (45%, 84%, and 107%, respectively), compared with vehicle (Figure 2A). In animals bearing Calu-6 tumors, a significant inhibitory effect of motesanib on tumor growth (66% inhibition) was only seen at the highest dose tested of 75mg/kg twice daily (BID) for 17days compared with vehicle (Figure 2B). In the NCI-H358 xenograft model, significant inhibition of tumor growth (94% and 127%, respectively) compared with vehicle was seen at the two highest motesanib dose levels (25- and 75-mg/kg BID; Figure 2C). In the NCI-H1299 xenograft model, significant inhibition of tumor growth (56% and 72%, respectively) compared with vehicle was observed at the two highest motesanib dose levels (25- and 75-mg/kg BID; Figure 2D). In mice bearing NCI-H1650 xenografts, motesanib at all three administered doses (15, 50, or 75mg/kg BID) significantly inhibited tumor growth (45%, 67%, and 78%, respectively) compared with vehicle (Figure 2E). In all treatment groups across the various models, motesanib was well tolerated. Body weights remained stable over the treatment periods and were similar to those of vehicle-treated control animals (Figure 2). Similar effects of VEGF inhibition on tumor growth were observed in a KRAS-driven genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (see Additional file 1). Table 1 summarizes the mutational status of cells from the various tumor xenografts along with representative antitumor activity of motesanib in each model. DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of KRAS mutations, one of the most common driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma, in three of the xenograft models and mutations in BRAF and NRAS, two less frequently occurring mutations associated with NSCLC [32], in two of the models. The functional significance of the BRAF mutation (heterozygous deletion of exon 2) is unknown. Notably, in all five NSCLC xenografts, motesanib monotherapy administered at 75mg/kg BID inhibited tumor growth by at least 66%, suggesting that motesanib has broad antitumor activity independent of the mutational characteristics of the NSCLC cells. Effect of motesanib in combination with cisplatin on human NSCLC tumor growth. The antitumor activity of motesanib or cytotoxic chemotherapy alone in Calu-6, NCI-H358, and NCI-H1650 xenograft models was enhanced by the combined administration of both agents. In some of these experiments, suboptimal doses of motesanib (based on previous dose?response data) were used to allow for the observation of additive activity. In animals bearing established Calu-6 tumors, motesanib (75mg/kg BID) or cisplatin (5mg/kg QW), a standard-of-care chemotherapy agent in NSCLC, significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with vehicle. However, when both agents were combined at the same dose and schedule as in the monotherapy experiments, tumor growth inhibition was significantly greater than that observed with either single agent alone (Figure 3A). Similarly, in mice bearing NCI-H358 tumors, combination treatment with motesanib (15mg/kg BID) and cisplatin (5mg/kg QW) resulted in significantly greater tumor growth inhibition than that achieved with either monotherapy (Figure 3B). In these two models, both treatment modalities (monotherapy and the combination of motesanib plus cisplatin) appeared tolerable as there were no significant changes in the animals\u00a1\u00af body weight over the course of the experiments (Figures 3A and ?and33B). Similar cooperative activity was observed in mice bearing established NCI-H1650 tumors. As seen with the other two xenograft models, combining both motesanib (15mg/kg QD) and cisplatin (4mg/kg QW) resulted in significantly greater tumor growth inhibition than that measured with either agent alone (Figure 3C). However, animals that received combination therapy showed a significant reduction from baseline (approximately 10%) in body weight (P<0.0001 vs vehicle, motesanib alone, and cisplatin alone; Figure 3C). The differential effects of motesanib and cisplatin on body weights in the NCI-H358 and NCI-H1650 models suggests that the mechanism of body weight loss observed in the NCI-H1650 model is not a general phenomenon related to the combination of motesanib and cisplatin. Efforts to understand this differential activity are being explored. Effect of motesanib in combination with docetaxel on human NSCLC tumor growth. Experiments parallel to those described above were performed for motesanib and docetaxel, another standard-of-care chemotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC, using the A549 and Calu-6 tumor xenograft models. To allow for the observation of additive activity, suboptimal doses of motesanib were used in some models based on previous dose?response data. As seen with cisplatin, the antitumor activity of the combined treatment modality was greater than that for either agent alone. In mice bearing A549 tumors, treatment with motesanib (7.5mg/kg BID) combined with docetaxel (5mg/kg QW) resulted in significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth than either agent alone (Figure 4A). In this experiment, both monotherapy and combination regimens had no adverse effect on the body weight of the animals (Figure 4A). Additive antitumor efficacy was also observed in the Calu-6 xenograft model. In mice bearing Calu-6 tumors, motesanib (75mg/kg BID) or docetaxel (30mg/kg QW) alone significantly inhibited tumor growth, and that effect was even greater when both agents were combined (Figure 4B). However, the combination of motesanib and docetaxel in the Calu-6 model was associated with a significant decrease from baseline in mean body weight (approximately 15%; Figure 4B). To better understand the enhanced antitumor efficacy in vivo, we performed a separate set of experiments to test whether treatment with motesanib plus chemotherapy had a direct effect on the proliferation of the different NSCLC cell lines in vitro. There was no difference in cell viability between cisplatin or docetaxel single-agent and motesanib/chemotherapy combination treatment. Results from a representative experiment with cisplatin and motesanib using Calu-6 cells are shown in Figure 5. We also investigated the possibility that the measured treatment effect of motesanib plus chemotherapy on the various tumor xenograft models was the result of changes in the plasma exposure of the respective agents. No consistent variations in the pharmacokinetics of motesanib or either of the chemotherapy agents when administered in combination were noted in the NSCLC models tested here (data not shown). This is in line with earlier experiments using xenograft models of other tumor types, reporting no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of motesanib and docetaxel when administered alone or in combination [24]. Histologic analysis of NSCLC tumor xenografts treated with motesanib plus cisplatin. Tumor morphology was examined to explore the potential mechanisms of action of motesanib combined with cisplatin. Immunohistochemical staining of NCI-H358 and NCI-H1650 tumors at the end of the experiments (day 33 and day 43, respectively) demonstrated that the vessel area percentage was significantly decreased after treatment with the suboptimal dose of motesanib (15mg/kg) alone or in combination with cisplatin at 5mg/kg (NCI-H358; Figure 6A) or 4mg/kg (NCI-H1650; Figure 6C), compared with vehicle or cisplatin monotherapy. In addition, tumor burden (tumor viable fraction\u00a1\u00bftumor weight) was significantly decreased in both the NCI-H358 and the NCI-H1650 xenograft models when motesanib plus cisplatin was administered in combination, compared with either vehicle or cisplatin monotherapy (Figures 6B and ?and6D).6D). In contrast, at the doses tested tumor burden was not decreased in either xenograft model when motesanib or cisplatin were given as monotherapy, presumably because both agents were used at suboptimal doses. Discussion. Recently, there has been increased recognition of histologic subtype as a potential predictor of efficacy with first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC [12,13]. A retrospective analysis of the pivotal E4599 trial of first-line bevacizumab combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel in nonsquamous NSCLC showed that patients with adenocarcinoma (the most frequent histologic subtype) who received bevacizumab combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel had favorable overall survival compared with patients who received carboplatin/paclitaxel alone [15]. Although the number of enrolled patients with other histologic subtypes was small, clinical benefits among these patients appeared more limited than among those with adenocarcinoma. Current multidisciplinary recommendations for changes in NSCLC classification [33] support the potential value of histologic subtype in influencing treatment decisions in NSCLC. In addition to histology, research has revealed the importance of driver mutations in NSCLC, which are particularly prevalent among adenocarcinomas, presenting at different incidence rates in specific patient groups. Preclinical and clinical evidence has shown that these mutations may affect response to targeted therapy [16,22], suggesting that a further division of NSCLC into clinically relevant mutational subgroups may allow for a more tailored treatment approach. Targeted treatments that may be effective regardless of mutational status may be even more desirable. Hence, it appears critical that preclinical studies assessing investigational agents should be designed to test activity in models that represent more than one NSCLC subtype. The antitumor activity of a number of VEGFR inhibitors either as single agents or combined with chemotherapy has been demonstrated in a variety of NSCLC xenograft models [34-38]. However, few of these studies have assessed activity in more than one or two different models. The present study aimed to assess the antitumor activity of motesanib as a single agent or combined with chemotherapy in human NSCLC xenograft models with varying genetic backgrounds and histology [36,39-41]. When administered alone, motesanib inhibited the growth of all five NSCLC xenografts, A549, Calu-6, NCI-H358, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H1650, in a dose-dependent manner. Calu-6 tumors were relatively resistant to treatment compared with the other cell lines: only the highest motesanib dose administered (75mg/kg BID) resulted in xenograft growth inhibition (66%). Decreased responsiveness to single-agent VEGFR inhibitors, including motesanib, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in the Calu-6 model (compared with other tumor xenograft models) have been described previously [34,35,42]. The reasons for this differential responsiveness are not immediately evident, but based on the above studies, it is likely rooted in causes other than variations in experimental design, because it has been seen across independent studies and with various therapies focusing on different molecular targets. In all models, tumor xenograft growth inhibition increased when motesanib was combined with QW cisplatin or docetaxel, agents that are components of standard two-drug chemotherapies for NSCLC treatment [4], compared with either single-agent treatment. The results from the experiment with the Calu-6 model are particularly noteworthy because of its relative resistance to treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors and EGFR-targeted agents alone. One possible explanation for the improved antitumor activity of the combination treatments is that angiogenesis inhibitors may modulate the tumor vasculature, resulting in enhanced delivery of chemotherapy to target cells [43,44], but we have not directly addressed this issue in the current study. Mutational status of the cells appeared to have had no influence on the antitumor activity of motesanib treatment. Regardless of whether cell lines had common driver mutations (ie, KRAS) or less frequently occurring mutations (ie, BRAF, NRAS) or a combination of mutated genes, treatment with motesanib as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy resulted in tumor growth inhibition, albeit at different doses depending on the model. Targeted treatments that may be effective regardless of mutational status of the patient may be particularly desirable, particularly for agents targeting the stroma, where the mutational spectrum is not expected to be equivalent. The antitumor activity that motesanib exhibited against the NSCLC xenograft models chosen for this study was mediated, at least in part, by an antiangiogenic mechanism rather than a direct effect on the tumor cells themselves. Unlike human medullary cancer cells that express VEGFR2 [26], VEGFR2 could not be detected in any of the cell lines and phosphorylated VEGFR2 could not be detected following exogenous administration of VEGF. Motesanib did not inhibit the proliferation of cells from any of the cell lines in vitro. The lack of inhibition of proliferation also suggests that other motesanib targets (eg, PDGFR and Kit) are not important in this context. It should be noted that some studies have reported that sorafenib and vandetanib (both of which inhibit VEGFR signalling) can attenuate the proliferation of lung cancer cells in vitro [45-47]. However, both of these agents also inhibit EGFR signalling and, consequently, it is not possible to ascertain whether the observed effects were due to inhibition of VEGFR signalling, EGFR signalling, or both. Treatment with single-agent motesanib or motesanib plus cisplatin showed significant reductions in tumor blood vessel area compared with vehicle in NCI-H358 and NCI-H1650 xenografts. These results are consistent with those from previous studies reporting that motesanib alone or combined with chemotherapy had antitumor activity in xenograft models of breast, thyroid, and colorectal cancer, which was also associated with a significant decrease in tumor blood vessel area [23-26]. Overall, our data support a predominant role for antiangiogenesis in inhibition of tumor growth by motesanib. Conclusions. Our data show that motesanib has antiangiogenic and antitumor activity in all five tested NSCLC subcutaneous xenograft models of varying histologic subtypes and genetic backgrounds. When combined with cisplatin or docetaxel, the antitumor activity of motesanib was significantly greater than single-agent treatment in each of the four xenograft models in which combination treatments were tested. Investigation of their activity in xenograft models with a variety of histologic subtypes is a valuable and appropriate strategy for preclinical assessment of anticancer agents in NSCLC. Methods. Cell lines and reagents. Non?small-cell lung cancer cell lines including A549 carcinoma, Calu-6 anaplastic carcinoma, NCI-H358 bronchioalveolar carcinoma, NCI-H1299 lung carcinoma, and NCI-H1650 bronchioalveolar adenocarcinoma cells were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) between 2001 and 2008. A549, Calu-6, NCI-H358, and NCI-H1299 cell lines were tested and authenticated, at the time of the experiments, by DNA sequencing of the following genes, which confirmed the presence of specific mutations equivalent to those previously described for these cells [48,49]: KRAS, NRAS, EGFR, BRAF, P53, PTEN, cMET, PIK3CA, and STK11 (see also Table 1). NCI-H1650 cells have been reported to carry mutations in CDKN2A, EGFR, and TP53[50,51]. We did not sequence these genes in this cell line but did identify an additional mutation in BRAF (heterozygous deletion of exon 2). NCI-H358 and NCI-H1299 cells are TP53 null per previously published literature [52,53]. Cells were maintained at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2. A549 cells were cultured in F-12K nutrient medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2mMl-glutamine (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Calu-6, NCI-H358, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H1650 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS and 2mMl-glutamine; NCI-H1650 cultures were further supplemented with 1\u00a1\u00bf nonessential amino acids. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from Lonza Walkersville Inc. (Walkersville, MD) and cultured in EGM-2 medium with EGM-2 SingleQuot supplement (Lonza Walkersville Inc.). Docetaxel was obtained from Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Bridgewater, NJ) and resuspended in PBS for in vitro cell assays. For in vivo assays, docetaxel was resuspended in the manufacturer-provided diluent and adjusted to the final concentration used before injection with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cisplatin (1mg/mL) was obtained from Bedford Laboratories (Bedford, OH) and APP Pharmaceuticals (Shaumburg, IL) and diluted in PBS for both in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro cell proliferation assays. Cells (3,000/well) were seeded in 96-well plates using DMEM High-Glucose medium (Invitrogen Corp.) supplemented with 10% FBS and 2mMl-glutamine (for A549, Calu-6, NCI-H358, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H1650 cells); or DMEM High-Glucose medium supplemented with 2mMl-glutamine and 50ng/mL of recombinant human VEGF (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) (for HUVECs treated with motesanib). Cells were cultured overnight before being treated, in duplicate, with 10-point serial dilutions of single-agent motesanib (0.0025 to 5000 nM in medium containing 1% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) or docetaxel (0.001 to 5000 nM in PBS) for 72hours at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. Cell viability was mea-sured using an ATPlite\u00a2\u00e2 1-step luminescence assay (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) as described previously [24]. To assess the effect of motesanib plus chemotherapy combination treatment on in vitro proliferation, A549, Calu-6, NCI-H358, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H1650 cells were seeded as described above and then treated with motesanib (10, 100, and 1000 nM in medium containing 1% DMSO) plus serial dilutions of cisplatin or docetaxel in PBS for 72hours at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. Cell viability was determined using the ATPlite\u00a2\u00e2 luminescence assay as described [24]. In vitro tumor cell VEGFR2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of VEGFR2 in tumor cells and HUVECs was assessed as described [26]. Briefly, HUVECs, A549, Calu-6, NCI-H358, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H1650 cells were cultured in full-serum conditions, serum-starved conditions, and serum-starved conditions plus recombinant human VEGF at a final concentration of 50ng/mL for 5minutes before harvesting. Cells were lysed, and VEGFR2 protein was immunoprecipitated using an anti-human VEGFR2 polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems) and Protein A beads. Phosphorylated VEGFR2 protein was detected by Western blot using 4G10 horseradish peroxidase (HRP)?linked antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA). To detect total VEGFR2, the blot was stripped and reprobed with the polyclonal anti-VEGFR2 antibody (R&D Systems). Signals were detected with chemoluminescence using SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL). Blot imaging was performed with a VersaDoc Imaging System Model 500 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and blot quantification with ImageQuant 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ). Tumor xenograft models. Animals were obtained from the following sources: female CD1 nu/nu mice (Calu-6 models) from Charles River Laboratories (Raleigh, NC), female athymic nude mice (A549, NCI-H358, and NCI-H1299 models) from Harlan Sprague Dawley (Indianapolis, IN), and CB-17 severe combined immunodeficiency mice (NCI-H1650 models) from Charles River Laboratories (Montreal, QC, Canada). Procedures met the standards of the Amgen Animal Care and Use Committee. The facilities where experiments involving animals were conducted were approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. On day 0, mice (approximately 5 to 9weeks old) were injected subcutaneously on the right flank with either of the following: cultured Calu-6 (1\u00a1\u00bf10 7 cells in 200 \u00a5\u00ecL of RPMI 1640 with 33% Matrigel [BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA]); A549 (5 x 10 6 cells in 100 \u00a5\u00ecL of F-12K with 50% Matrigel); NCI-H358 (5\u00a1\u00bf10 6 cells in 100 \u00a5\u00ecL RPMI 1640 with 50% Matrigel); NCI-H1299 (5\u00a1\u00bf10 6 cells in 100 \u00a5\u00ecL of RPMI 1640 with 50% Matrigel); or NCI-H1650 cells (5\u00a1\u00bf10 6 cells in 100 \u00a5\u00ecL of RPMI 1640 with 50% Matrigel). After tumors became established, mice (9 to 10 per treatment group) received the following agents either alone or in combination as specified by the experimental protocols: vehicle (water, pH 2.5) or motesanib orally once daily (QD; 15 to 75mg/kg) or twice daily (BID; 7.5 to 75mg/kg); PBS or intraperitoneal cisplatin (4 or 5mg/kg) once weekly (QW); or PBS or intraperitoneal docetaxel (5 or 30mg/kg QW). For combination experiments, vehicle was added to the single agent dosing regimen at the appropriate route and schedule to match the combination group. Tumor dimensions were assessed twice weekly using an electronic digital caliper. For the Calu-6 tumor model, tumor volume was calculated as (length\u00a1\u00bfwidth\u00a1\u00bfheight). For the A549, NCI-H358, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H1650 models, tumor volume was calculated as (width 2\u00a1\u00bflength/2) where width was the smaller of two measurements and length was the larger of two measurements. All combination tumor studies were done in a blinded fashion. Body weight was recorded twice weekly as an index of toxicity. Tumor histology. The methods of tumor xenograft histologic examination have been described previously [24]. Briefly, tumors were removed at the end of experiments, weighed, bisected sagittally, and fixed in either zinc formalin (Anatech Ltd, Battle Creek, MI) or cold zinc-Tris fixative (BD Biosciences) and embedded in paraffin. Tumor sections fixed in zinc-Tris were immunostained for CD31 (vascular endothelium marker) using a monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) followed by 3,3\u00a1\u00af-diaminobenzidine (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) as the chromogen. Tumor viability was assessed by hematoxylin staining. Tumor cross-sectional area and viable area were assessed by thresholding and automated pixel counting. The viable fraction was expressed as a percentage of total area. Estimated tumor burden was calculated as viable fraction\u00a1\u00bftumor weight. Scanned images of slides were analyzed using VisioMorph software v3.0.8.0 (Visiopharm, Horsholm, Denmark). Statistical analysis. The effects of single-agent or combination treatment with motesanib, cisplatin, or docetaxel on tumor growth and body weight were assessed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) followed by Scheffe, Bonferroni/Dunn, or Dunnett post hoc testing using StatView software (version 5.0.1; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). For immunostaining, blood vessel area and viable tumor burden of tumors were compared by Student t test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Abbreviations.

                "text": "Selective inhibition of Ezh2 by a small molecule inhibitor blocks tumor cells proliferation\tEzh2 (Enhancer of zeste homolog 2) protein is the enzymatic component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which represses gene expression by methylating lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) and regulates cell proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development. Recently, hot-spot mutations of Ezh2 were identified in diffused large B-cell lymphomas and follicular lymphomas. To investigate if tumor growth is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Ezh2, we developed a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor, EI1, which inhibits the enzymatic activity of Ezh2 through direct binding to the enzyme and competing with the methyl group donor S-Adenosyl methionine. EI1-treated cells exhibit genome-wide loss of H3K27 methylation and activation of PRC2 target genes. Furthermore, inhibition of Ezh2 by EI1 in diffused large B-cell lymphomas cells carrying the Y641 mutations results in decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. These results provide strong validation of Ezh2 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer. Ezh2 is the mammalian homolog of Enhancer of Zeste, the key component of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which represses gene expression in development (1). Ezh2 and the other two proteins, Suz12 and EED, form the core PRC2 complex, which possesses histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity and methylates H3K27 (2, 3). H3K27 methylation has been correlated with transcriptional repression and heterochromatin formation (4). The Drosophila ortholog, E(z), was initially identified as a regulator of homeotic gene expression and body segmentation (5). In mammals, Ezh2 is highly expressed in stem cells and actively proliferating cells, and down-regulated in differentiated cells (6). Ezh2 knockout in mice leads to developmental abnormality and embryonic lethality (7, 8). Ezh2-null ES cells are viable (8) and Ezh2 is involved in maintaining pluripotency and repression of lineage-differentiation genes (8?10). Ezh2 is overexpressed in a broad spectrum of tumors, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, myeloma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, and so forth (1, 6). Overexpression of Ezh2 in mouse mammary gland leads to epithelial hyperplasia (11). Multiple studies using si/shRNA show that reduction of Ezh2 expression in tumor cell lines inhibits cell proliferation (12), migration, and invasion (13) or angiogenesis (14), and leads to apoptosis (15). Ezh2 contains the characteristic SET domain [Suppressor of variegation 3?9 (Suv (3?9), Enhancer of zeste (E(z)) and Trithorax] (16) present in most HMTs. Recurrent somatic mutations in the SET domain of Ezh2 was identified in diffused large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) patients (17?22). These mutations lead to the change of tyrosine (Y) 641 to phenylalanine (F), serine (S), asparagine (N), histidine (H), cysteine (C), or alanine (A) 677 to glycine (G). The Y641 mutant and A677G proteins show enhanced activity on H3K27me2 peptide (20, 23). Cancer cell lines heterozygous for these Ezh2 mutants show increased H3K27me3 and decreased H3K27me2 level (17, 20, 21, 23). Wild-type and mutant Ezh2 proteins may work cooperatively in cells to maintain a high level of H3K27me3 (23). It is therefore hypothesized that the Ezh2 hot-spot mutations and their enhanced activity toward H3K27me2 promotes DLBCL cell proliferation. In this study, we developed an S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) competitive inhibitor of Ezh2, EI1, which inhibits the methyltransferase activity of the Ezh2/PRC2 with high selectivity across an HMT panel. EI1 treated cells exhibited decreased H3K27 methylation without changes of other histone H3 methylation marks. Using this tool inhibitor, we showed that inhibition of Ezh2 in DLBCL cells carrying hot-spot mutations and some Ezh2 overexpressed tumor cell lines results in decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Thus, inhibition of Ezh2 enzymatic activity may provide a therapeutic option for the treatment of DLBCL and other cancers. Results.  Identification and Biochemical Characterization of EI1 as a Potent and Selective Inhibitor of PRC2.. To identify inhibitors of Ezh2/PRC2, we performed a high-throughput screen using recombinant PRC2 protein complex containing Ezh2, Suz12, EED, RbAP48, and AEBP2 (24). EI1 (Fig. 1A) was designed based on one chemical scaffold identified from the high-throughput screen. This compound demonstrated potent, concentration-dependent inhibition of the enzymatic activity against both Ezh2 wild-type and Y641F mutant enzymes with IC50 of 15 \u00a1\u00be 2 nM and 13 \u00a1\u00be 3 nM, respectively (Fig. 1B). To understand the mode of inhibition for EI1, SAM competition experiments were carried out under the conditions of saturated substrate peptide. In accordance with the Cheng?Prusoff relationship for a competitive binding mode, the IC50 value of EI1 increased linearly with increasing concentration of SAM. The fitting of the data into the Cheng?Prusoff equation for competitive inhibition using linear regression analysis gave a K i value of 13 \u00a1\u00be 3 nM (Fig. 1C). Although SAM is the common cofactor for all HMTs, EI1 showed remarkable selectivity against Ezh2 over other HMTs (Table 1). All biochemical reactions were carefully characterized with enzymology studies and the SAM and substrate concentrations were kept at their respective K m for most of the HMTs. Strikingly, EI1 displayed \u00a1\u00ad90-fold selectivity for Ezh2 over Ezh1, and >10,000-fold selectivity over other HMTs (Table 1). In contrast, another well-characterized SAM competitive HMT inhibitor, sinefungin, showed no selectivity toward Ezh2 (Table 1). Taken together, our results indicate that EI1 is a potent and selective inhibitor against Ezh2.  EI1 Inhibits Cellular H3K27 Methylation and Activates Ezh2 Target Gene Expression.. Previous studies using si/shRNA to knock down Ezh2 or other components of PRC2 showed that DLBCL and rhabdoid tumor cells were highly dependent on PRC2 for proliferation (25, 26). Therefore, we tested the effect of EI1 in these cell lines, including the DLBCL cells carrying Ezh2 mutations [WSU-DLCL2 (Ezh2 Y641F), SH-DHL6 (Ezh2 Y641N)] or wild-type Ezh2 [(OCI-LY19 (Ezh2 WT), and GA10 (Ezh2 WT)] and a rhabdoid tumor line G401 (Ezh2 WT). EI1 dramatically inhibited the H3K27me3 and H3K27me2 levels in these cells in a dose-dependent manner, but H3K27me1 was largely unchanged (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1 A and B). The effect was similar in these cell lines, although they have different basal H3K27me3 and H3K27me2 levels. For example, in WSU-DLCL2, SU-DHL6, and Karpas422 with Ezh2 mutations, the H3K27me3 level was much higher than that in DLBCL cells with wild-type Ezh2 (Fig. S1C). A time-course study was performed in WSU-DLCL2 cells to understand the kinetics of H3K27 methylation inhibition. The H3K27me3 level was decreased 24 h after EI1 treatment, and reached the lowest level after 4?5 d (Fig. 2B). To test the specificity of EI1, we examined other histone H3 lysine methylation marks. As shown in Fig. 2C, the other marks were not changed. p16 is a well characterized Ezh2 target gene (26?28) and its promoter is directly bound by Ezh2 and enriched for H3K27me3 (8, 27). Depletion of Ezh2 in G401 cells leads to up-regulation of p16 expression and senescence (26). We therefore examined the effect of EI1 on p16 expression in G401 and found EI1 could activate p16 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D, Left). Consistently, EI1 also caused growth inhibition of G401 (Fig. S3). In a time-course study, p16 expression was activated 2 d after EI1 treatment and the expression level increased by 20-fold at day 5 (Fig. 2D, Right). The decrease of H3K27me3 was readily observable 24 h after EI treatment (Fig. S1D). These results indicate that the decrease of H3K27me3 precedes the activation of p16 expression. ChIP experiments were performed to examine the change of H3K27me3 and Ezh2 status on p16 promoter (Fig. 2E). Both Ezh2 and H3K27me3 were enriched at the p16 promoter (Fig. 2F), as previously reported (8, 27). Specific and significant enrichment of H3K27me3 and Ezh2 were observed at region A and B, and the enrichment decreased toward region C (Fig. 2F). Following EI1 treatment, H3K27me3 signals were significantly reduced across the p16 promoter (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, Ezh2 remained bound at the p16 promoter (Fig. 2F). Therefore, EI1 activated p16 expression by suppressing H3K27me3, but not Ezh2 occupancy at the promoter.  EI1 Caused Similar Phenotypes as Ezh2 Knockout in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts.. To assess the selectivity of EI1 in cells, we established SV40-T immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying the Cre-ERT2 transgene and two floxed Ezh2 loci (29). Treatment with 4-OH-tamoxifen (4-OH-T) led to significant depletion of Ezh2 and H3K27me3 (Fig. 3A). EI1 treatment did not affect Ezh2 protein level but caused similar loss of H3K27me3 (Fig. 3A). The immortalized MEFs showed decreased proliferation (\u00a1\u00ad40?50%) following Ezh2 depletion by 4-OH-T (Fig. 3B). Consistently, a similar decrease in proliferation was observed in EI1-treated MEF. Importantly, there was no further reduction of proliferation when the MEF was treated with EI1 in combination with 4-OH-T (Fig. 3B). Therefore, EI1 treatment mimics Ezh2 knockout in the MEFs to inhibit H3K27me3 and cell proliferation.  EI1 Selectively Inhibited the Growth of DLBCL Cells Carrying Ezh2 Mutation.. To test if inhibition of Ezh2 might be efficacious to inhibit cancer cell growth, siRNAs specific to Ezh2 was designed and transfected into OCI-LY19 (Ezh2 WT) and WSU-DLCL2 (Ezh2 Y641F). Two independent siRNAs, named siEzh2-1 and siEzh2-2, knocked down Ezh2 mRNA by \u00a1\u00ad80% (Fig. S2). Both siRNAs inhibited the proliferation of WSU-DLCL2 but had little effect on OCI-LY19 (Fig. 4A), suggesting the proliferation of DLBCL cells with Ezh2 mutations is dependent on Ezh2. To test whether EI1 treatment has a similar effect as Ezh2 knockdown, we measured the proliferation after EI1 treatment and IC50s of EI1 on both wild-type and mutant Ezh2 DLBCL lines. The proliferation of Ezh2 mutant DLBCL cells, including WSU-DLCL2, SU-DHL6, Karpas422, DB, and SU-DHL4, was strongly inhibited by EI1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B and C and Fig. S3). In contrast, Ezh2 wild-type DLBCL cells, including OCI-LY19 and GA10, were not affected by EI1, and Toledo was only weakly affected by EI1 (Fig. 4 B and C and Fig. S3). Thus, specific inhibition of Ezh2 enzymatic activity by EI1 selectively inhibited the growth of DLBCL cells carrying Ezh2 mutations. Soft agar colony formation evaluates if cancer cells can proliferate in an anchorage-independent manner (30). We tested the effect of EI1 on the colony formation ability of WSU-DLCL2 and OCI-LY19 cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, both the size and the number of WSU-DLCL2 colonies were decreased after EI1 treatment. In contrast, the colony formation of OCI-LY19 was not affected. Taken together, these results indicate that EI1 is not generally toxic to cells, but selectively inhibits the neoplastic properties of DLBCL cells with Ezh2 mutation.  EI1 Causes Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis of DLBCL Cells with Y641 Mutations.. To understand the role of Ezh2 in the regulation of the proliferation of DLBCL lines carrying Ezh2 Y641 mutations, we examined the DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression by BrdU incorporation and FACS analysis. In WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with EI1 for 7 d, significant decrease of BrdU + cells (reduced from 41?8.72%) was detected (Fig. 5A). The percentage of cells in G2/M also decreased, whereas the percentage of cells in G1 was increased (Fig. 5 A and B). Similar results were observed in two other Ezh2 mutant DLBCL cell lines (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the Ezh2 wild-type cells OCI-LY19, GA10, and Toledo did not show significant changes of DNA synthesis or cell cycle distribution (Fig. 5 A and B). Cell cycle progression is regulated by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases and levels of various cyclins (31). We therefore surveyed the expression of cyclins in EI1-treated WSU-DLCL2 cells. Cyclin A and B1 protein levels were diminished after 6 d of EI1 treatment (Fig. 5C). Similar effects were observed in other DLBCL cells with Ezh2 mutations (Fig. S4). This finding is consistent with the reduction of the G2/M population from FACS analysis. A mild increase of sub-G1 population was observed in EI1-treated SU-DHL6 and Karpas422, suggesting an increase of apoptosis. To further examine this phenomenon, we carried out the Western blotting of procaspase 3 and cleaved (c)-caspase 3 in EI1-treated SU-DHL6 cells. Indeed, c-caspase 3 level was gradually elevated with increasing treatment time (Fig. 5D). Taking these data together, we show that inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Ezh2 by EI1 can significantly block cell cycle progression and induce apoptosis in Ezh2 mutant DLBCL cells.  Inhibition of Ezh2 Causes Down-Regulation of a Proliferation Gene Signature and Up-Regulation of a Memory B-Cell Signature in DLBCL.. We examined the gene-expression changes in Karpas422 (Ezh2 Y641N) after EI1 treatment in a time-course experiment. EI1-treated cells were compared with the corresponding controls to obtain the significantly differentially expressed gene lists using a two-tailed Student t test at each time point. A cutoff of P value < 0.05 and fold-change > 1.5 was used to select the EI1 regulated genes. The number of genes that showed statistically significant change increased with increasing treatment time (Fig. 6A). More genes were up-regulated than down-regulated between days 1 and 3 after EI1 treatment (Fig. 6A), suggesting the early response to Ezh2 inhibition is primarily gene up-regulation, which is consistent with Ezh2\u00a1\u00afs role in transcriptional repression. By day 6, the number of down-regulated genes dramatically increased, which could be because of the secondary response (Fig. 6A). To investigate if genes with expression changes at early time points are more likely direct PRC2 targets, two differential expressed gene lists were generated at days 3 and 9 after EI1 treatment, respectively. These lists were compared with the PRC2 and H3K27me3 target genes in human embryonic fibroblasts and centroblasts, respectively (10, 25). The gene list at day 3 showed better enrichment to the known PRC2 target genes than the day 9 gene list (Fig. S5). Almost all these genes are up-regulated, suggesting early response genes are direct Ezh2 targets. We further selected 13 genes that were up-regulated by EI1 from microarray and revalidated their expression by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Fig. S6A). ChIP experiments were performed to determine if these genes were labeled by H3K27me3 at the promoters. EI1 treatment significantly decreased the H3K27me3 enrichment in these 13 gene promoters, but not the negative control GAPDH promoter (Fig. S6B). These data further strengthen the notion that the depletion of H3K27me3 at target gene promoters correlates to EI1-dependent transcriptional up-regulation. To further delineate the pathways that are responsive to Ezh2 inhibition, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the microarray data (P value < 0.05 and fold-change > 1.5) after 6 d of EI1 treatment (32, 33). The analysis revealed that the genes down-regulated by EI1 showed significant enrichment of a proliferation signature in DLBCL (Fig. 6B) (Proliferation_DLBCL signature from Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project), consistent with our data on cell proliferation and cell cycle (Figs. 4 and ?and5)5) (34, 35). Interestingly, genes up-regulated by EI1 showed significant enrichment of a gene set distinguishing splenic marginal zone memory B cell from the germinal center B cell (Splenic_marginal_zone_B cell_gt_GC_B cell signature from Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project), indicating that Ezh2 inhibition may promote differentiation to memory B-cell (Fig. 6C) (35, 36). We compared our data with a geneset that negatively correlated with Ezh2 mRNA level in DLBCL (25), and found that this gene signature showed significant enrichment in the genes up-regulated by EI1 treatment (Fig. 6D). Intriguingly, our data also displayed significant enrichment of a geneset regulated in prostate cancer cell after siRNA-mediated knockdown of Ezh2 (Fig. 6 E and F and Fig. S7) (37). Discussion. In this study, we developed a potent small molecule inhibitor, EI1, which inhibits Ezh2 activity through competition with the cofactor SAM. EI1 is highly selective against Ezh2 over its close homolog Ezh1 and other HMTs. The SET domains of Ezh1 and Ezh2 are 90% identical (Fig. S8A). Structural modeling shows the divergent residues I626 and C663 in Ezh2 (T664 and S664 in Ezh1) are around the EI1 binding pocket, even though no direct interaction with EI1 (Fig. S8 B and C), suggesting these residues may contribute to the selectivity. Future structural studies of EI1-Ezh2 cocrystal structure may help to understand how such high selectivity is achieved. EI1 treated cells show specific reduction of H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 (Fig. 2C). Using Ezh2-floxed MEF cells, we further demonstrated that EI1 had similar effect as Ezh2 knockout on H3K27 methylation and proliferation, indicating that EI1 is a highly specific Ezh2 inhibitor suitable for functional studies. siRNA knockdown of PRC2 complex, such as Ezh2, Eed, and Suz12, could disrupt the complex and block cancer cell proliferation (1, 12?14, 37). Here, we demonstrated that inhibition of HMT activity of Ezh2 by EI1 without disrupting the chromatin binding of PRC2 is sufficient to blocks cancer cell proliferation and colony formation, particularly in Ezh2 mutant containing DLBCL cells. Thus, a small molecule inhibitor of Ezh2 can be efficacious in treating cancers. During the review of our manuscript, Knutson et al. (38) and McCabe et al. (39) published two Ezh2 inhibitors, which also act in a SAM-competitive manner and are highly selective over Ezh1. Although it was not shown whether the gene up-regulation by these compounds correlated with the decrease of H3K27me3 mark, both compounds could inhibit the proliferation of several Ezh2 mutant lymphoma cell lines. This finding is consistent with our findings and independently validates Ezh2 as a potential target for cancer treatment. All Ezh2 mutations are heterozygous in DLBCL and the mutant cells contain much higher levels of H3K27me3 than wild-type cells (Fig. S1C) (17, 20, 21). Ezh2-Y641 mutants have weak biochemical activity toward unmethylated H3K27 and H3K27me1 peptide substrates, whereas they have much higher catalytic activity converting H3K27me2 to H3K27me3 (20, 23, 40). Wild-type and mutant Ezh2 complexes may collaborate to convert unmethylated H3K27 toward high levels of H3K27me3 (40). Interestingly, although H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 are similarly depleted in DLBCL cells with or without Ezh2 mutation, Ezh2 mutant cells are specifically growth-inhibited by EI1 (Figs. 2A and 4 B and C, and Fig. S3). This finding suggests that the Ezh2 mutation in DLBCL may be an oncogenic driver. Because EI1 is equally active against both the wild-type and Y641 mutant Ezh2, it will be interesting to develop a mutant-selective inhibitor in the future to evaluate if it will be equally efficacious as EI1. In this study, we conducted a detailed cell cycle analysis of EI1 treated DLBCL cells. Ezh2 mutant cells are growth-arrested by EI1 with G1 arrest (Fig. 5). Expression of cyclin A and B1 is down-regulated (Fig. 5). GSEA analysis showed EI1 can reactivate the expression of PRC2 target genes (Fig. S5) (37). After 6 d of treatment, the proliferation signature was significantly down-regulated (Fig. 6B) (34) and accompanied by the activation of a set of memory B-cell?specific genes (Fig. 6C) (36). These results suggest inhibition of Ezh2 may induce growth arrest and differentiation into memory B cells. We found multiple genes up-regulated by EI1 have H3K27me3 enrichment at their promoters. EI1 effectively reduced the H3K27me3 level on these promoters and activated their expression. At the p16 promoter, EI1 suppressed H3K27me3 level but Ezh2 remained bound to the promoter. To our knowledge, this demonstration that inhibition of histone H3K27me3 can occur without dissociation of the Ezh2 complex from its target gene is unique. Ezh2 can interact with other chromatin modifying enzymes, such as histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases (4) to repress transcription. Future studies should investigate if all Ezh2 target genes can be sufficiently reactivated by reversing promoter H3K27me3 level alone. Such knowledge might help to understand how to use Ezh2 inhibitors as single agent or in combination for cancer treatment. Materials and Methods.  Cell Culture.. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C, 5% (vol/vol) CO 2. OCI-LY19, GA10, Toledo, WSU-DLCL2, DB, SU-DHL4, Karpas422 and SU-DHL6 were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, 11875) with 15% (vol/vol) FBS (Invitrogen, 10099-141). G401 was cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, 11995) with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 0.055 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, M7522). MEFs were from the Antoine Peters laboratory (41) and cultured in DMEM with 10% (vol/vol) FBS. The immortalized MEF was generated by retroviral transduction of pBABE-SV40 T and selected with hygromycin (Invitrogen). Single clones were selected based on the inducible knockout of Ezh2 in response to 4-OH-T (100 nM).  Biochemical Assay.. PRC2 biochemical reaction was carried out in reaction buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1% BSA, 0.01% Triton, 0.5 mM DTT). The 20 nM wild-type PRC2 complex, 1 \u00a5\u00ecM SAM, and 1.5 \u00a5\u00ecM H3K27me0 (21?44); or 10 nM Y641F mutant complex, 1 \u00a5\u00ecM SAM, and 3 \u00a5\u00ecM H3K27me2 (21-44) were used, respectively, because they have differential substrate preference (38).  Microarray Analysis.. RNA was purified from Karpas422 after 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 d after DMSO or EI1 (5 \u00a5\u00ecM) treatment. Triplicate samples were collected and hybridized to U133_Plus 2 Chips (Affymetrix). The gene-expression data were normalized using the Robust Multiarray Averaging method (42). To generate a differentially expressed gene list, EI1-treated samples were compared with the corresponding DMSO controls using a cutoff of fold-change > 1.5 and P value < 0.05 (Student t test). GSEA was performed as previously described (33). Additional details of biochemical and cellular reagents and protocols are described in SI Materials and Methods.

                "text": "Lenalidomide-mediated enhanced translation of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 protein up-regulates expression of the antileukemic microRNA-181a in acute myeloid leukemia\tRecently, we showed that increased miR-181a expression was associated with improved outcomes in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). Interestingly, miR-181a expression was increased in CN-AML patients harboring CEBPA mutations, which are usually biallelic and associate with better prognosis. CEBPA encodes the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 transcription factor. We demonstrate here that the presence of N-terminal CEBPA mutations and miR-181a expression are linked. Indeed, the truncated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 isoform, which is produced from the N-terminal mutant CEBPA gene or from the differential translation of wild-type CEBPA mRNA and is commonly believed to have no transactivation activity, binds to the miR-181a-1 promoter and up-regulates the microRNA expression. Furthermore, we show that lenalidomide, a drug approved for myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma, enhances translation of the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 isoform, resulting in higher miR-181a levels. In xenograft mouse models, ectopic miR-181a expression inhibits tumor growth. Similarly, lenalidomide exhibits antitumorigenic activity paralleled by increased miR-181a expression. This regulatory pathway may explain an increased sensitivity to apoptosis-inducing chemotherapy in subsets of AML patients. Altogether, our data provide a potential explanation for the improved clinical outcomes observed in CEBPA-mutated CN-AML patients, and suggest that lenalidomide treatment enhancing the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 protein levels and in turn miR-181a may sensitize AML blasts to chemotherapy. Key Points.   Introduction. Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) is the largest subset of AML, comprising up to 45% of cases. 1 In CN-AML patients, several molecular markers have been identified as predictors of clinical outcome, including the mutational status of the CEBPA gene. 2?5 CEBPA encodes the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein \u00a5\u00e1 (C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1), a transcription factor critical for normal myeloid cell differentiation. 6 In the hematopoietic system, C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 is expressed early in myeloid precursors and up-regulated during their commitment to granulocytic pathway and maturation. 6?8 Several reports demonstrated that diverse molecular mechanisms are responsible for C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 inactivation of expression or function in various types of leukemia (AML and chronic myelogenous leukemia). 9,10 The C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 protein contains multiple N-terminal transactivation domains and 1 C-terminal basic-leucine zipper region, responsible for DNA binding and protein dimerization. 11,12 As a result of differential translation initiation from a single CEBPA mRNA molecule, 2 protein isoforms are produced (full-length p42 and N-terminally truncated p30), 13 which play different functions in gene regulation and proliferation. 14?16 Approximately 15% of CN-AML patients carry mutations in the CEBPA gene that are clustered in 2 regions. The N-terminal frame-shift mutations, which occur in approximately 90% of CEBPA mutant patients, prevent expression of the full-length transcriptionally active C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 protein, but allow translation of the truncated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 isoform. 2,14,17,18 In contrast, the C-terminal mutations disrupt the basic-leucine zipper domain, and abolish C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 DNA-binding. 14 In most cases, the N-terminal mutations occur concurrently with a C-terminal mutation and are present on different alleles. Paradoxically, those biallelic double CEBPA mutations have a more favorable prognostic impact. 3,19 However, the mechanisms through which CEBPA mutations lead to better response to treatment and improved outcomes have not been described. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that repress translation and/or initiate degradation of specific target messenger RNAs (mRNA) and have recently been shown to play a role in carcinogenesis. 20 Genome-wide expression profiling of AML has revealed miRNA signatures associated with distinct cytogenetic or molecular subtypes of the disease 5,21 and have proven useful to predict clinical outcome in AML patients. 22 Recently, we and others reported an association of higher miR-181a expression and favorable outcomes especially in a molecular subset of high-risk CN-AML patients (FLT3-ITD positive and/or NPM1 wild-type) and in AML patients with cytogenetic abnormalities. 22?24 In healthy cells, miR-181a regulates B-cell development, influences T-cell sensitivity to antigens by modulating T-cell receptor signaling intensity, and is involved in early steps of hematopoiesis. 25 A tumor suppressor activity of miR-181a was reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 26 gliomas, 27 and astrocytomas, 28 and was attributed to direct targeting of BCL2 family members. 28 Recently, it was shown that ectopic expression of miR-181a sensitizes AML cell lines to chemotherapy. 29 In addition, we reported that higher miR-181a expression was associated with the presence of CEBPA mutations in CN-AML patients. 5 In this study, we show that higher miR-181a expression in CN-AML patients is predominantly present in the patients harboring CEBPA N-terminal mutations, as opposed to those having single C-terminal mutations or wild-type CEBPA. We also demonstrate that miR-181a expression is directly modulated by the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 isoform. Furthermore, we show that the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide enhances the expression of the N-truncated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 that is followed by increased miR-181a expression and augmented sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapy. Finally, using murine models engrafted with human AML cells either expressing ectopic miR-181a, or treated in vivo with lenalidomide, we observed a strong inhibition of tumor growth. Thus, our findings support future investigations seeking novel pharmacologic therapies for AML patients with inadequate expression and/or function of the full-length C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42, with the intent to enhance the expression of the N-truncated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 isoform and thus, the expression of miR-181a. The therapeutic induction of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 and in turn of miR-181a are intended to recapitulate the favorable outcomes of AML patients with double CEBPA mutations after treatment with intensive chemotherapy. Methods. Cell lines and AML patient samples. The cell lines THP-1 (TIB-202), MV4-11 (CRL-9591), HL60 (CCL-240), KG1a (CCL-246.1), and HEK-293T were from ATCC. CEBPA mutations were analyzed in adults < 60 years of age with untreated, primary molecular high-risk CN-AML enrolled onto the cancer and leukemia Group B (CALGB) treatment protocols 9621 and 19 808. 5 RNA samples were analyzed for miRNA expression using a previously reported Ohio State University (OSU) customized miRNA chip. 5 Images of the miRNA microarrays (E-MTAB-1320) were acquired, and calculations, normalizations, and filtering of signal intensity for each microarray spot were performed as previously reported. 5 Expression levels of miR-181a were compared according to CEBPA mutation status using the Wilcoxon-Rank sum test. Estimated probabilities of survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test evaluated differences between survival distributions. Written informed consent for these studies was obtained from all patients in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The AML patient blasts used for ex vivo experiments were obtained from apheresis blood samples collected from patients treated at OSU and stored in the OSU Leukemia Tissue Bank. After thawing, the cells were placed in RPMI medium supplemented with 20% FBS and cytokine cocktail supporting proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors (StemSpan CC100, StemCell Technologies) and the adherent cells were removed. Informed consent to use the tissue for laboratory studies was obtained from each patient according to the OSU institutional guidelines. Plasmids transfection and miRNA detection by nanoelectroporation. Nanoelectroporation (NEP) is a microchannel-nanochannel array with the 2 separate microchannels for cell and plasmid loading, that is capable of delivering the precise amount of transfection reagents into individual cells. 30 C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 expression vectors containing either wild-type, N-terminal (H24Afs), or C-terminal (R300L) mutants were loaded in one side of microchannels, whereas KG1a cell suspension (< 10 3/mL) was loaded into the other side of microchannels with a single cell in each microchannel being moved to the tip of the nanochannel by optical tweezers. Two electric pulses across the nanochannels (240V, 5ms each) were applied through platinum electrodes to conduct the transfection. Transfected cells were cultured in situ after the removal of the plasmid solution. To detect the miR-181a expression level inside individual cells, a locked nucleic acid (LNA) molecular beacon (MB; miR-181a LNA-MB sequence: 5\u00a1\u00c7-FAM-accgcg-ActCacCgaCagCgtTgaAtgtt-cgcggt-BHQ1-3\u00a1\u00c7 [upper cases represent LNA]; Sigma-Aldrich) was transfected 24 hours later through the same nanochannel. The images were acquired 4 in 4% PFA solution, at 20\u00a1\u00c6C by Nicon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon Instruments) using Nikon Plan Apo VC 100X, N.A. = 1 and Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics). NIS-Elements AR 3.2 software (Nikon Instruments) was used for image acquisition and processing. The average fluorescence of each cell (with background correction) was measured 45 minutes after the MB transfection. Three or 4 cells were transfected by NEP for each plasmid. Xenograft models in NOD/SCID mice. THP-1 cells were injected (10 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells/mouse) subcutaneously (1 tumor per mouse) into 4- to 6-week-old NOD/SCID mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Lenalidomide (50 mg/kg) or vehicle control (1 \u00a1\u00bf PBS) were directly injected into the tumors twice a week for 2 weeks. Five tumors were treated with lenalidomide and 3 tumors were injected with vehicle. After 6 weeks the mice were killed and tumor sizes were assessed using caliper and by weight. To test the effect of miR-181a overexpression on tumor growth, THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with the Amaxa system (Solution V, Lonza) with pSUPERIOR-retro-puro vector overexpressing miR-181a, or empty vector. After a 6-hour culture, the cells were injected, and 6 weeks later tumor sizes were determined as described above. The in vivo animal studies were conducted with the approval of the OSU Institutional Lab Animal Care and Use Committee, and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for animal care. Additional methods are provided in supplemental Methods (available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). Results. N-terminal C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 mutations are associated with higher miR-181a levels in CN-AML. We demonstrated that CN-AML patients with either high miR-181a expression, 22,24 or harboring CEBPA mutations 5 have a more favorable prognosis. Mutations in CEBPA tend to cluster to 2 regions, N or C-terminal and are present mainly in CN-AML patients. 5,13 The majority of these patients have mutations in both alleles (double mutants), which have better outcomes compared with the patients with monoallelic mutations or wild-type gene (Figure 1A). We also showed that patients with CEBPA mutations had higher miR-181a expression. 5 We sought to determine whether the higher miR-181a expression was associated with a particular type of CEBPA mutation (N vs C-terminal). We analyzed the miR-181a expression among younger (< 60 years) CN-AML patients (n = 171) with wild-type CEBPA, monoallelic C-terminal, monoallelic N-terminal, or biallelic (concurrent N and C-terminal) mutated CEBPA (see supplemental Methods). Expectedly, very few patients presented with single N-mutations (n = 4). Patients with N-terminal mutations (single or double) tended to have a higher miR-181a expression than patients with a single C-terminal mutation or wild-type CEBPA (Figure 1B). These differences were statistically significant when patients with biallelic (N and C-terminal) mutations compared with patients with single C-terminal mutations (P = .03) or with wild-type alleles (P < .001). Given the very small number, single N-terminal mutation patients could not be compared with those in the remaining subgroups. These results were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR in 3 patients (Figure 1C), each representing a different CEBPA genotype (wild-type, N-terminal I68Lfs, and C-terminal E167GfsX3 mutants). The relative expression of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 and p30 polypeptides were determined (supplemental Figure 1). miR-181a is coded by 2 separate genes, miR-181a-1 and miR-181a-2, located on chromosomes 1q32.1 and 9q33.3, respectively. Thus, we tested if the expression of both genes were associated with the distinct C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 mutants by measuring the levels of miR-181a precursors, chromosome 1-derived pre-miR-181a-1 and chromosome 9-derived pre-miR-181a-2. A 12-fold higher expression of pre-miR-181a-1 was observed in the patient harboring an N-terminal C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 mutation compared with the patient expressing the wild-type C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 (Figure 1C). Only a slight increase of pre-miR-181a-1 expression was seen in the sample containing C-terminal C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 mutation. In contrast, the expression of precursor miR-181a-2 was not affected in the AML patient with C-terminal mutation, and up-regulated only 3.73-fold in the case with N-terminal mutation, compared with the patient with wild-type CEBP\u00a5\u00c1 (Figure 1C). These data suggest that miR-181a-1 gene expression derived from chromosome 1 is predominantly affected in patients harboring N-terminal CEBPA mutations. To further validate these results functionally and to avoid the interplay of various C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 protein isoforms produced simultaneously from the wild-type and mutant alleles in individual AML specimens, we constructed vectors expressing either wild-type or mutant CEBPA genes and introduced them individually into the K562 cell line, which does not express endogenous C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1. 6,31 Schematic diagrams for the various C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 wild-type and mutant proteins are shown in Figure 2A. Two N-terminal mutations (P23Qfs and H24Afs) led to frame-shifts precluding expression of the full-length p42 protein, but allowing for reinitiation of translation at the downstream in-frame translational start site; this resulted in the expression of N-terminally truncated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 isoform. 9,14 The C-terminal mutation, R300L, has an amino acid substitution within the highly conserved nuclear localization sequence (NLS). 32 Confocal microscopy of transiently transfected K562 cells (Figure 2B, supplemental Figure 2A) showed that the wild-type C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 proteins were localized in the nuclei, as were the products from the N-terminally mutated genes (P23Q and H24A). In contrast, the C-terminal mutant protein (R300L) was found mainly in the cytoplasm. These results were confirmed by Western blot analyses using nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions prepared from the same cells (Figure 2C). In accord with the published data, 14 the N-terminal mutants produced the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 protein isoform, which correlated with the increased expression of nuclear protein UBC9, previously described as being indirectly regulated by C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 and not by the full-length p42 isoform. 33 Next, we measured the expression of miR-181a precursors (pre-miR-181a-1 and pre-miR-181a-2) in K562 cells expressing ectopic C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 mutant or wild-type proteins (Figure 2D). Consistent with our previous data, the highest expression of pre-miR-181a-1 was observed in the cells expressing the N-terminal mutants (3- to 4.5-fold), however only a slight increase in pre-miR-181a-1 expression was observed for the wild-type and C-terminally mutated isoforms, compared with the empty vector control. The slight increase of pre-miR-181a-1 expression seen among the C-terminally mutated isoform was probably because of the small but noticeable presence of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 protein in the nuclear fraction. The expression of H24Afs N-terminal mutant resulted in the highest levels of pre-miR-181a-1 (3.2-fold more than the levels induced by the wild-type C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1), whereas the expression of the P23Qfs N-terminal mutant was associated with 2.2-fold higher pre-miR-181a-1 expression (Figure 2D). In general, the increase in miR-181a-1 expression was associated with the expression and function (as determined by UBC9 expression; Figure 2C) of the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30. The expression of miR-181a-1 was also up-regulated in cells coexpressing N and C-terminal mutants of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 similarly to what we observed in patients with double CEBPA mutations (supplemental Figure 2). In agreement with the results obtained from AML patient samples (Figure 1B), the effect of each C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 isoform on the chromosome 9-derived pre-miR-181a-2 expression was not as prominent (Figure 2D). To demonstrate the differential impact of CEBPA mutants and wild-type on miR-181a expression, we transfected plasmids encoding wild-type, N-terminal and C-terminal mutated CEBPA in AML KG1a cells that do not express CEBPA (C.J.H., unpublished data, February 2013; also Radomska et al 37) using a nanochannel electroporation (NEP) technique, which was developed by our group to deliver precise amounts of charged molecules or particles into individual cells with minimal cell damage. 30 NEP relies on the selection of applied electric voltage, pulse duration and pulse number to achieve plasmid dosage control. Using the same poration conditions, a similar amount of plasmids was delivered to each transfected cell. 30 A fluorescent LNA-MB was used to measure miR-181a at a single cell resolution. Figure 2E shows a significant increase in miR-181a expression in cells receiving the N-terminal mutated CEBPA compared with those receiving C-terminal mutated or wide-type CEBPA. Taken together, our data suggest that N-terminal mutants are functionally more active than wild-type and C-terminal mutants in enhancing the expression of miR-181a-1. The expression of the pre-miR-181a-1 is regulated by the N-terminally truncated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 protein. As noted in the introduction and diagrammed in Figure 2A, CEBPA mRNA can be translated from at least 2 in-frame translation start sites, leading to production of full-length C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 and N-terminally truncated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 proteins. 34 Because we observed a correlation between the expression of patient-derived N-terminal frame-shift mutants and miR-181a levels, we investigated the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30/miR-181a interplay using inducible K562 stable cell lines expressing either C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 or C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 isoforms fused to human estrogen receptor (ER) ligand binding domain. 31 On \u00a5\u00e2-estradiol treatment, C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-ER fusion proteins translocate into nuclei, where they can exert their effects. Figure 3A shows miR-181a precursor levels assayed in K562 stable lines after a 48-hour treatment with \u00a5\u00e2-estradiol and compared with the levels in the control cell line that was transduced with the vector expressing the ER portion of the fusion protein. In the presence of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30-ER, pre-miR-181a-1 expression was increased 6.3-fold (Figure 3A). A somewhat lesser effect (2.42-fold) was observed in the cell line expressing C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42-ER (Figure 3A), similar to the data observed among cells expressing the full-length C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 isoform (Figure 2D). Similar data were also obtained for THP-1 cells stably transduced with constitutively active HA-tagged C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 35 expression construct (Figures 3C-E). Viable THP-1 cells constitutively expressing HA-C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 could not be established because of differentiation-inducing activity of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 protein (unpublished observations). However, compared with the empty vector control line, the cells expressing C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 demonstrated a 3.5-fold increase in expression of pre-miR-181a-1 (Figure 3C). Increases in precursor miR-181a-1, as well as mature species were also apparent in Northern blot (Figure 3D). In summary, using different in vitro systems we demonstrated that C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30, and to a lesser extent C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42, can induce chromosome 1-derived miR-181a-1 expression in AML cell line models. Because the N-terminal CEBP\u00a5\u00c1 mutations in AML are not capable of producing the wild-type full-length C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 isoform, but allow for translation of the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 protein (Figure 2C), 14 we conclude that C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 is the main isoform responsible for up-regulation of miR-181a-1 in CEBPA mutated CN-AML patients. C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 physically interacts with the promoter of miR-181a-1 and regulates its expression. Given that our previous 5 and current data showed a correlation between the expression of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 and increased expression of miR-181a-1 in AML patients, next we sought to identify the putative C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-responsive element within the miR-181a-1 promoter. It was recently reported that a region of approximately 600 base pairs (bp) upstream of the miR-181a-1 gene exhibits a promoter activity in immortalized human oral keratinocytes, but the molecular mechanism(s) regulating this activity were not investigated. 36 Using several transcription factor binding site prediction engines (TFSearch, TESS, MatInspector), we identified 2 potential C/EBP-binding sites located between nucleotides ?101/?96 and ?159/?154 of the miR-181a-1 promoter. To test the binding of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 to those sites, we prepared nuclear extracts from HEK-293T cells transiently transfected with CEBPA expression vectors coding for either the full-length or N-truncated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 isoforms. As shown in Figure 4A, the more proximal site (nts ?101/?96) bound both C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 and p30 isoforms in a sequence-specific manner: mutation of the putative site abrogated the binding of both C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 proteins. The addition of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 antibody (which recognizes both p42 and p30 isoforms) to the binding reactions led to formation of super-shifted complexes. Western blot data revealed that C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 and C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 isoforms were expressed at similar levels (Figure 4B). In contrast, the binding of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 proteins to the distal predicted C/EBP site (nts ?159/?154) was not observed (data not shown). To determine the transactivation potential of each C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 isoform on the miR181a-1 promoter, we inserted a 192 bp proximal promoter fragment upstream of the firefly luciferase gene and tested the resulting luciferase activity in the absence and presence of each C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 isoform. As demonstrated in HEK-293T cells and shown in Figure 4C, both isoforms transactivated the reporter gene, although C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 exhibited a stronger activity than the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 isoform (6.5-fold vs 4.2-fold, respectively). Part of the promoter activity in C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42?transfected cells may be caused by the expression of the p30 isoform produced from the p42 expression vector (Figure 4A-C). The reporter construct containing a C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 site mutation (which abrogated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 binding, Figure 4A) showed a decrease in transactivation by both C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 and p30 (22% and 32%, respectively) but did not completely inhibit it. These data suggest that in addition to the direct binding to the miR181a-1 promoter, both C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 isoforms, albeit p30 more efficiently than p42, may contribute to miR181a-1 regulation by an indirect mechanism via protein-protein interaction with other miR-181a-1 promoter-binding factors. The immunomodulatory compound lenalidomide induces both C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 and miR-181a expression. Thus far, our data showed that N-terminal CEBPA mutations (expressing C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 protein) associated with higher miR-181a levels, which in turn predict better outcomes in CN-AML patients, 22?24 and that C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 was more potent in the up-regulation of miR-181a-1 than C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42. Therefore, we reasoned that the pharmacologic up-regulation of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 and in turn of miR-181a would be an attractive therapeutic option to improve the clinical outcomes of AML patients carrying wild-type CEBPA, but with the expression of a nonfunctional C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 (such as C-terminal mutant, or serine 21 phosphorylated form). 31,37 Thus, we focused our attention on compounds that could act as modulators of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 protein expression. The immunomodulatory compound, lenalidomide (Revlimid, Celgene) was selected based on its ability to up-regulate erythroid-specific genes and its clinical activity in AML. 38?40 We also reported that a gene profile for CEBPA mutant AML was consistent with partial erythroid differentiation. 5 Based on these observations, we hypothesized that lenalidomide was a probable candidate for inducing expression of miR-181a via modulation of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 isoforms. AML patient-derived blasts were cultured in vitro in the presence of 3.0\u00a5\u00ecM lenalidomide and cells were collected hourly for Western blot analyses. The 3.0\u00a5\u00ecM concentration of lenalidomide was previously shown to be clinically achievable in vivo. 39 We observed an induction of both C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 isoforms and an increase of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 expression compared with C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 (Figure 5A). The induction of the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 isoform expression reached maximum between 5 and 8 hours of the treatment. As expected the miR-181a expression increased 2.5-fold after 12 hours and 3.0-fold after 24 hours of lenalidomide treatment (Figure 5B; same patient sample is shown in Figure 5A-B; also see supplemental Figure 3). Furthermore, AML primary samples treated with lenalidomide in vitro for 5 days showed a decrease in cell viability (supplemental Figure 3). Next, we performed analyses of bone marrow samples from relapse/refractory AML patient who participated in the OSU clinical trial (NCT01132586) receiving lenalidomide before induction chemotherapy. Bone marrow samples (Nos. 1-3) from 3 younger AML patients (< 60 years) were selected based on the availability of material for the analysis. As shown in Figure 5C, C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 protein expression was induced by day 5 of lenalidomide treatment (before initiation of chemotherapy) compared with the pretreatment baseline and paralleled by the increase in miR-181a levels. Although an increase of both C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 isoforms was observed in these samples, it was probable that C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 induced miR-181a expression more effectively than C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42, as we demonstrated in our previous experiments (Figures 3 and ?and4).4). Consistently, the expression levels of miR-181a and C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 expression were higher after lenalidomide treatment in bone marrow samples from 3 AML patients (Nos. 4-6) with available material and treated on a Washington University clinical trial (supplemental Figure 4). 40 We conclude that lenalidomide treatment in vitro and in vivo leads to increase of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 expression and induction of miR-181a expression in AML patient blasts. Of note, the lenalidomide-mediated induction of miR-181a expression was found only in C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-expressing cells (THP-1 and HL60; Figure 6B and supplemental Figure 5, respectively), and not in cells lacking the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 expression (K562; supplemental Figure 5), supporting that C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 mediates the lenalidomide-dependent mechanisms of miR-181a up-regulation. Lenalidomide treatment sensitizes leukemic cells to cytarabine chemotherapy. Cytarabine (Ara-C) is a pyrimidine antagonist, which interferes with DNA synthesis and is used in upfront and salvage regimens for AML. 41,42 To improve the cytotoxic activity of Ara-C treatment, various novel drug combinations have been explored. 43,44 Recently, it was demonstrated that miR-181a can sensitize a chemotherapy-resistant HL60 cell line to Ara-C treatment. 29 Having found that miR-181a is up-regulated in response to lenalidomide, we asked whether pretreatment of AML cells with this compound can similarly sensitize the cells to Ara-C. When THP-1 cells were treated with either 3\u00a5\u00ecM lenalidomide, 1\u00a5\u00ecM Ara-C, or both compounds simultaneously, an additive cytotoxic effect was observed (Figure 6A). Using THP-1 cells transiently transfected with antagomiR-181a, or a nonsilencing control oligoribonucleotide, we asked whether the lenalidomide effect was mediated by miR-181a expression. As shown in Figure 6B, antagomiR-181a efficiently down-regulated levels of the endogenous miR-181a and the lenalidomide-induced up-regulation of miR-181a was effectively blocked by antagomiR-181a. Regardless of the levels of miR-181a, lenalidomide treatment led to an increase in C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 protein (Figure 6C), which indicates that the up-regulation of miR-181a is a downstream event with respect to regulation of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1. After the transfection with antagomiR-181a or nontargeting control, THP-1 cells were treated with 3.0\u00a5\u00ecM lenalidomide or vehicle every 24 hours for 3 days, followed by a single application of Ara-C at concentrations ranging between 0\u00a5\u00ecM and 5.0\u00a5\u00ecM and allowed to incubate for 72 hours. Cellular proliferation was determined by MTS assay. As shown in Figure 6D, Ara-C alone inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion; however, the addition of lenalidomide had a stronger inhibitory effect. Furthermore, down-regulation of miR-181a levels by the transfected antagomiR-181a prevented the antiproliferation effect associated with the lenalidomide treatment (Figure 6D solid blue), whereas antagomiR-181a had no effect on the cell response to Ara-C alone (Figure 6D). From these data, we concluded that lenalidomide sensitizes leukemic cells to conventional Ara-C therapy via miR-181a. Lenalidomide treatment in vivo causes a decrease in xenograft tumor size. Patients responding to lenalidomide were found to have increased miR-181a expression levels (Figure 5). Moreover, forced expression of miR-181a resulted in reduced cell growth (supplemental Figure 6A) and colony-forming ability (supplemental Figure 6B), as well as increased spontaneous death (increased number of cells in sub-G 1 phase; supplemental Figure 6C). In addition, transient expression of miR-181a in AML patient blasts led to a 2-fold increase of annexin V labeling, suggesting that blasts expressing increased levels of miR-181a had a lower apoptosis threshold (supplemental Figure 6D). To further prove the causal role of miR-181a in in vivo tumor growth inhibition, mice were injected with THP-1 cells transiently transfected with miR-181a expression vector (n = 5) or with empty control vector (n = 5). After 6 weeks, mice were killed and tumors measured. A tumor-suppressing activity of miR-181a was revealed by decreased tumor sizes and weights, in mice engrafted with cells forced to express miR-181a (P < .01; Figure 7A). Having established that lenalidomide increases miR-181a expression, we asked whether, similar to miR-181a, this compound could also suppress tumor growth in vivo. NOD/SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with untransfected THP-1 cells (10 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells). Four weeks after engraftment, lenalidomide (50 mg/kg; n = 5) or vehicle (n = 3) were injected directly into the tumors twice a week for 2 weeks. A relatively higher dose of lenalidomide was used in this experiment to compensate for a short half-life of the drug and to ensure a promptly evaluable pharmacologic effect in the leukemia tumors. The mice were killed and tumors excised to evaluate the effects of lenalidomide. The average size of the lenalidomide-treated tumors (57.5 \u00a1\u00be 0.06 mm) was significantly decreased compared with the vehicle-treated tumors (166.8 \u00a1\u00be 1.08 mm; P = .008; paired t test; Figure 7B-C). The tumor sizes after lenalidomide administration were decreased by approximately 3-fold. Consistent with our previous results, lenalidomide-treated tumors displayed increased miR-181a expression (Figure 7D). The expression of miR-181a was found to be nearly 10-fold higher (P < .05) in the tumors treated with lenalidomide compared with the vehicle-treated tumors. In summary, the tumor-suppressing effect of lenalidomide, was accompanied by an increase of miR-181a expression, which is analogous to tumor growth suppression by constitutive ectopic expression of miR-181a, thereby suggesting antitumorigenic properties for this miRNA. Discussion. We and others reported that CN-AML patients carrying mutations in CEBPA have better clinical outcomes compared with patients with wild-type CEBPA. 2?5 We also showed a strong association of CEBPA mutations and high miR-181a levels 5 and better outcomes of CN-AML patients with higher miR-181a levels. 22?24 The favorable impact of CEBPA mutations is restricted to only those patients with double mutations (usually concurrent N and C-terminal mutations) and not observed in patients with single mutations, among which the majority are found only within the C-terminal region. 3,4 A hallmark of AML with CEBPA N-terminal mutations present in > 90% of CEBPA mutated patients is that these mutations prevent the expression of the full-length C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 isoform, whereas the expression of the truncated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 isoform is undisturbed, or even enhanced. 14 In general, C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 acts as a dominant-negative isoform of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 function, 9,14,45 but proteomic approaches identified exclusive targets of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 (UBC9 and PIN1). 33,46 Thus, we questioned whether C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 could exert any positive activity on the regulation of miR-181a expression. Indeed, we found that although both C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 isoforms can directly bind to the miR-181a-1 promoter, the N-terminally truncated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 is more potent in its transactivation. To the best of our knowledge, in contrast to UBC9 and PIN1, the miR-181a-1 gene located on chromosome 1 is the first reported direct target of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30. Because higher miR-181a expression is associated with a favorable response to treatment and better outcomes, 22?24 we decided to pursue a strategy that increases the endogenous expression of this miRNA in myeloid blasts. Giving the similarities between the gene expression profile predictive of response to lenalidomide and the gene profile associated with CEBPA mutational status, lenalidomide was selected as a potential modulator of miR-181a expression via C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-dependent mechanisms. Indeed, in both preclinical models and treated AML patients, we showed that lenalidomide treatment of AML blasts harboring wild-type CEBPA led to induction of both C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30, C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42, and miR-181a. Lenalidomide has clinical activity in AML. 39,40 Thus, in addition to its immunomodulatory properties, it is also possible that this activity occurs via 2 mechanisms that implicate C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1. One mechanism involves the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30?mediated increased expression of miR-181a, which contributes to better chemotherapy response 29 (Figure 6), thereby improving the outcomes of AML patients with wild-type CEBPA expressing either, nonfunctional (phosphorylated on serine 21), 31,37 or insufficient levels of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 to allow for granulocytic maturation. 14 Because lenalidomide also increased C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 levels, it is probable that a second antileukemic mechanism may involve up-regulation of the differentiation-promoting C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 polypeptide. Of course, lenalidomide's immunomodulatory activity may also mediate clinical response in AML patients, especially in those patients who previously have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 39 The mechanism of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 up-regulation by lenalidomide remains to be elucidated, but preliminary results suggest that lenalidomide modulates the activity of translation elongation factors responsible for C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 expression (C. Hickey, unpublished data). Different biologic functions of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 isoforms have been reported relating to myeloid proliferation and differentiation. 14,45,47 C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 lacks a differentiation-inducing and antimitotic activities 15,48 Paradoxically, the lack of a cell-cycle inhibitory function of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 serves as an attractive feature when treating AML with chemotherapeutic agents, such as Ara-C that are most effective in dividing cells. Our data argue that the favorable impact of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 may also related to its ability to induce miR-181a, which in turn can sensitize AML cells to chemotherapy. 29 In agreement, we showed here that lenalidomide can also sensitize THP-1 cells to Ara-C. This lenalidomide activity is inhibited in the presence of miR-181a antagomiR, thereby supporting that lenalidomide-induced sensitivity to Ara-C is dependent on its ability to increase miR-181a. To prove this principle, a phase 1 trial of lenalidomide followed by the Ara-C induction chemotherapy is currently ongoing at our institution (NCT01132586). In summary, we presented a model for C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30?dependent miR-181a up-regulation. The absence of the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 antiproliferative property 15,48 and higher levels of miR-181a, 22,24 that have been shown to sensitize leukemia cells to chemotherapy (this study), 29 may partly explain the improved outcomes in CEBPA mutated CN-AML patients, who usually present with N-mutations predictive of C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 expression. One may raise the question as to why patients with wild-type CEBPA have lower levels of miR-181a than those with mutations affecting the N-terminal region of the protein. Indeed, the C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42 isoform, which is linked to differentiation, was found to be expressed concurrently with the truncated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 isoform among lenalidomide-treated AML patients (Figure 5, supplemental Figures 3 and ?and4).4). This polypeptide also contributes to miR-181a regulation in vitro (Figure 4). It is possible that in patients with wild-type CEBPA, lower miR-181a levels are because of a silenced CEBPA 49 or nonfunctioning C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1 protein. 31,37 Thus, these patients may benefit from pretreatment with agents such as lenalidomide alone, or in combination with hypomethylating agents (for epigenetically silenced CEBPA), 49 or kinase inhibitors (for nonfunctioning serine 21 phosphorylated C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p42). 33 These therapies would increase C/EBP\u00a5\u00e1-p30 expression and in turn miR-181a, thereby leading to increase sensitivity to chemotherapy and better clinical outcome.

                "text": "Ibuprofen Inhibits Colitis-Induced Overexpression of Tumor-Related Rac1b 1\tThe serrated pathway to colorectal tumor formation involves oncogenic mutations in the BRAF gene, which are sufficient for initiation of hyperplastic growth but not for tumor progression. A previous analysis of colorectal tumors revealed that overexpression of splice variant Rac1b occurs in around 80% of tumors with mutant BRAF and both events proved to cooperate in tumor cell survival. Here, we provide evidence for increased expression of Rac1b in patients with inflamed human colonic mucosa as well as following experimentally induced colitis in mice. The increase of Rac1b in the mouse model was specifically prevented by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen, which also inhibited Rac1b expression in cultured HT29 colorectal tumor cells through a cyclooxygenase inhibition.independent mechanism. Accordingly, the presence of ibuprofen led to a reduction of HT29 cell survival in vitro and inhibited Rac1b-dependent tumor growth of HT29 xenografts. Together, our results suggest that stromal cues, namely, inflammation, can trigger changes in Rac1b expression in the colon and identify ibuprofen as a highly specific and efficient inhibitor of Rac1b overexpression in colorectal tumors. Our data suggest that the use of ibuprofen may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with serrated colorectal tumors or with inflammatory colon syndromes. Introduction. Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the Western world. The majority of cases are sporadic tumors that present an adenoma-carcinoma sequence involving somatic mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene and in the oncogene KRAS [1]. In addition, about 10% to 15% of cases are characterized by a high level of DNA microsatellite instability as a result of somatic inactivation of a DNA mismatch repair gene. These tumors mainly occur in the proximal colon segment and carry a global CpG island hypermethylation phenotype (eventually including the mismatch repair gene hMLH1) and oncogenic mutations in the BRAF gene [2]. They follow a different neoplastic pathway that is independent of KRAS and has been designated as the serrated polyp pathway [3]. Genotyping of microdissected polyps has confirmed that mutations in KRAS and BRAF are alternative early, tumor-initiating events and that serrated polyps harbor BRAF mutations with a DNA methylation phenotype [4?7]. The most frequent BRAF mutation is BRAF-V600E and occurs predominantly inmelanoma, thyroid, and colorectal tumors. Although the mutation activates the protein's kinase activity and stimulates mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinases, BRAF-V600E alone has less oncogenic potential than mutant KRAS in cell transformation assays [8]. We recently described that about 80% of BRAF-V600E-positive colorectal tumors also overexpress Rac1b [9], a highly activated splice variant of the signaling GTPase Rac1. Rac1b lacks down-regulation by Rho-GDI, exists predominantly in the GTP-bound active conformation, and promotes cell cycle progression and cell survival through activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u00a5\u00eaB) [10?12]. Importantly, colorectal tumor cells expressing BRAF-V600E and Rac1b were highly sensitive to combined inhibition of both events, leading to 80% cell death [9]. Based on the findings that BRAF-V600E and hyperactive Rac1b functionally cooperate in tumor cells, a genetic pathway was proposed for a subtype of colorectal tumors [9,13] that are initiated by a BRAFV600E mutation but later require overexpression of hyperactive Rac1b to allow further tumor progression. It remains to be established, however, how the overexpression of Rac1b is triggered in tumor cells. Tumor cells are known to interact with the stromal microenvironment. For instance, tumor cells produce cytokines to which stromal cells respond with the secretion of proteases that remodel the extracellular matrix, of pro-angiogenic factors that attract blood vessels, and of mitogenic factors that feedback on tumor cell survival. Vice versa, cytokines released by the tumor microenvironment are now known to further promote tumor cell growth at various stages of tumor development [14,15]. In addition, stimulation of the NF-\u00a5\u00eaB pathway is simultaneously promoting an inflammatory response and a pro-survival signal for epithelial cells [16,17]. Interestingly, colon tumors with microsatellite instability or BRAF mutation are characterized by abundant lymphocytic infiltration. Besides inflammation caused by infectious or environmental agents, chronic inflammatory states in organs or tissues have also been identified as a risk factor for cancer development and promoted the prophylactic administration of anti-inflammatory drugs to patients [18?20]. Here, we describe an increase in Rac1b expression in inflamed colonic as well as following experimental induction of colitis in laboratory mice. We further identified the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen as a specific inhibitor of both the increase in Rac1b expression and the survival of corresponding Rac1b overexpressing tumor cells in vivo. Materials and Methods. Human Tissue Samples. All research programs involving the use of human tissue were approved and supported by the INSERM (French National Institute for Health and Medical Research) Ethics Committee and these tissues are considered as surgical waste in accordance with French ethical laws (L.1211-3?L.1211-9). Human colonic mucosa specimens were obtained from patients who had undergone surgery for colonic inflammation (two patients with Crohn's disease and four patients with diverticulitis). Four of the six inflamed samples were matched with the corresponding distant macroscopically healthy mucosa (the two patients with Crohn's disease and the two patients with diverticulitis). Two additional samples of control mucosa were obtained from colonic resections for colon cancer and dissected from at least 10 cm from the tumors. Tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00a1\u00c6C until use. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Selection Conditions. HT29 cells were maintained in RPMI and SW480 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, both supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (all reagents from Gibco Invitrogen Corporation, Barcelona, Spain). The normal colonocyte cell line NCM460 [21] was received by a licensing agreement with INCELL Corporation (San Antonio, TX). The cells were routinely propagated under standard conditions in M3:10 medium (INCELL) containing 10% fetal calf serum. For biochemical assays, cells were seeded in 24- or 96-well plates at 2 x 10 5 or 3 x 10 4 cells/well and treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or the indicated concentrations of the various DMSO-diluted anti-inflammatory compounds (all from Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid, Spain). Cells were then analyzed at the indicated time points by various methodologies (see below). To generate cell lines stably expressing ectopic green fluorescent protein (GFP) or GFP-Rac1b wild type (wt) [10], HT29 cells were transfected with either vector using LIPOFECTAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and selected for 4 weeks with G418 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 500 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml. Brighter clones were then collected, pooled and cultured for 2 additional weeks before use in biochemical assays or mouse xenografts and maintained at 250 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml G418 while in culture. SiRNA and Inducible BRAF-V600E Expression. SiRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous Rac1b and BRAF-V600E expression in HT29 cells was performed as previously described [9]. For inducible expression of BRAF-V600E in NCM460, the complete BRAF coding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a pEGFP-BRAF-V600E construct [9] and subcloned using SacI and SalI restriction sites into the pPTuner vector of the ProteoTuner Shield System N (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). This vector generates a fusion protein with the FKBP (L106P) destabilization domain that causes the rapid constitutive degradation of the fusion protein until the addition of Shield1 to the culture medium. Shield1 is a membrane permeable stabilizing ligand that binds to the destabilization domain tag, \u00a1\u00b0shielding\u00a1\u00b1 the fusion protein from proteasomal degradation and thus allowing its rapid accumulation. Reverse Transcription-PCR and Real-Time PCR. Colonic mucosa and xenograft-derived tumors were disrupted using a Polytron apparatus and RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Hoerdt, France). RNA from cell line cultures was extracted with the RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). One microgram of total RNA was then reverse transcribed using random primers (Invitrogen) and Ready-to-Go You-Prime Beads (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Real-time relative quantification was performed as described [9] with minor alterations, namely, all mouse samples were analyzed against a cDNA sample prepared from total RNA from NIH 3T3 cells, and the reverse primer from the \u00a1\u00b0total Rac1 detector\u00a1\u00b1 pair was changed to 5\u00a1\u00c7-GAT GAT AGGAGT ATT GGG ACA GT to eliminatemouse/human mismatches. Immunofluorescence Microscopy. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% (vol/vol) formaldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.2% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then stained with 4\u00a1\u00c7,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma), and images were recorded on a Leica TCS-SPE confocal microscope and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis. Samples were prepared and detected as described [9]. The antibodies used in this study were rabbit anti-GFP ab290 from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom), polyclonal rabbit anti-Rac1b (Millipore, Billerica, MA, #09-271), and mouse anti-\u00a5\u00e2-tubulin clone Tub2.1 from Sigma-Aldrich (as a loading control). For densitometric analysis, film exposures from at least three independent experiments were digitalized and analyzed using ImageJ software National Institutes of Health (NIH). Cell Viability and Prostaglandin E 2 Assays. HT29 cells seeded in 96-well plates were treated for the indicated periods with the given nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) concentrations. Cell viability was evaluated using the CellTiter-Glo ATP-based luminescence assay (Promega, Madison, WI) and plotted as percent of DMSO-treated cells at the same time points. The amount of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) released by the cells to the culture medium was determined using the DetectX PGE 2 Chemiluminescent Enzyme Immunoassay (Arbor Assays, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luminescent signals were recorded with a Lucy 2 microtiter plate luminometer (Anthos, Krefeld, Germany). All results were confirmed by at least three independent experiments. Mice Dextran Sulfate Sodium Treatment and Tumor Xenografts. All experiments on mice were performed in accordance with institutional and national guidelines and regulations, and ethics approval was obtained from the INSERMEthics Committee. Male C57BL/6 and nude mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Lille, France). To induce colitis, C57BL/6 mice (10?12 weeks old) received dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; 36?50 kDa; MP Biomedicals Europe, Illkirch, France) dissolved in sterile tap water (3% wt/vol) or ibuprofen (1 mg/ml) or a combination of the two compounds. DSS treatment was carried out for 5 days, followed by two recovery days, whereas ibuprofen was administered throughout the 7 days. Control groups received sterile tap water. Body weight was monitored daily in all groups. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The cecum was removed and the remainder of the colon was divided into proximal and distal halves. For tumorigenicity assay in nude mice, exponentially growing parental, GFP, or GFP-Rac1b wt stably expressing HT29 cells were harvested and resuspended to a concentration of 2 x 10 7/ml. Cells (2 x 10 6) were inoculated in the right flank of mice (day 0). Animals were then fed with aspirin or ibuprofen in drinking water at doses adjusted for body mass from regular human posologies (1 mg/ml). Tumor development was followed weekly by caliper measurement along two orthogonal axes, length (L) and width (W). The volume (V) of tumor was calculated by the equation for ellipsoid (V = L x W2 x \u00a5\u00f0/6). After euthanasia on day 28, tumors were dissected from neighboring connective tissues and weighed. Then, they were divided into three parts and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00a1\u00c6C until further processing. Statistical Analysis. All results are expressed as means \u00a1\u00be SEM. Differences between controls and the multiple treatments applied to mice or cultured cells were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance test, followed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests when significant results were obtained. When relevant, direct statistical comparisons between two groups were made using unpaired two-tailed t tests. The level of significance was set at P \u00a1\u00c2 .05. Results. BRAF-V600E Mutation and Rac1b Overexpression Constitute Two Independent Events in Colorectal Tumorigenesis. We previously found that most colorectal tumors carrying the BRAF-V600E mutation also show Rac1b overexpression and that Rac1b was required to sustain survival and tumorigenicity of colorectal tumor cells [9]. To understand how the overexpression of Rac1b was triggered in colorectal tumors, we asked whether mutant BRAF, which has been widely considered as the tumor-initiating event, was sufficient to cause Rac1b overexpression. For this, we first used HT29 tumor cells, which were previously identified as a model for the BRAF-V600E/Rac1b tumor type, and depleted expression of the mutant BRAF-V600E allele by RNA interference. We observed that under these conditions the expression levels of endogenous Rac1b remained unaffected (Figure 1A). Next, we overexpressed oncogenic BRAF-V600E in nontransformed human colonocyte NCM460 [21] that we found to express endogenous Rac1b at levels comparable to normal colon mucosa (Figure 1B); however, no evidence for an increase in Rac1b expression was observed (Figure 1C). Together, these data strongly suggest that the presence of mutant BRAF alone was not sufficient to induce overexpression of Rac1b and that BRAF mutation and Rac1b overexpression constitute two independent events in colorectal tumorigenesis. Pro-inflammatory Cues Are Associated with Rac1b Overexpression In Vivo. Another well-known factor promoting tumor cell progression is the surrounding tumor cell microenvironment [14?16]. Inflammation, for example, constitutes a persistent challenge of the mucosa tissue and has been associated with increased risk for CRC [22,23]. This prompted us to determine whether patients with inflammatory diseases of the colon would reveal altered Rac1b expression in the affected mucosa cells. RNA samples from surgery specimens of inflamed and control colonic mucosa from six affected individuals were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription. PCR (qPCR) and showed a mean increase of 1.6-fold in Rac1b transcript (Figure 2A). This is comparable to the roughly two-fold increase in the alternative splicing of Rac1b that we observed in the colorectal cell line HT29 [9] and which was sufficient to yield a high level of active Rac1b protein due to the hyperactivation properties of this variant [10,24,25]. To further investigate the hypothesis that pro-inflammatory cues may promote Rac1b expression, a mouse model for experimentally induced colitis was employed. Mice were fed with the polymer DSS in drinking water for 5 days. After 2 days of recovery with water (acute colitis), animals were sacrificed. Expression of Rac1b in proximal and distal colon segments was analyzed by qPCR and revealed a more than two-fold up-regulation of the alternative transcript Rac1b (Figure 2B). These in vivo experiments strongly supported the possibility that the inflammatory process is involved in Rac1b overexpression. Ibuprofen Selectively Downregulates Rac1b Expression in CRC Cells. NSAIDs are widely used to treat inflammatory processes and their regular administration has been reported to delay sporadic colorectal tumor growth and to cause regression of polyps [18?20]. Because most of the anti-tumorigenic effects of NSAIDs were derived from in vitro studies using cancer cell lines, including HT29 [26?28], we tested whether a panel of NSAIDs and other compounds, previously described to have an ameliorative effect in CRC [26,27,29,30], would also affect Rac1b expression levels in these cells. Following 48 hours of treatment with a broad range of drug concentrations [26,29?32], only ibuprofen and indomethacin appeared to decrease Rac1b expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas eight of the nine remaining drugs, including aspirin, had either no effect or lacked dose dependency (see Figure 3A). Unexpectedly, the drug piroxicam actually increased expression of the Rac1b transcript. Experiments were then repeated for four selected drugs using a time course and the concentration range found in the plasma of patients on continuous therapeutic regimens [29,31?33]. The results confirmed that at usual therapeutic concentrations only ibuprofen treatment caused a significant decrease in Rac1b expression in these cells (Figure 2B), reaching levels close to those found in healthy colon mucosa [9]. Aspirin had no effect on Rac1b expression and indomethacin failed to produce an effect as robust as ibuprofen. Notably, piroxicam reproducibly induced an increase in Rac1b (Figure 3B). Ibuprofen Decreases the Viability of HT29 Cells through a COX-Independent Mechanism Requiring Rac1b Down-Regulation. Rac1b signaling has been previously described to sustain colorectal tumor cell survival [9,12]. We thus asked whether the changes in Rac1b expression were reflected by changes in HT29 cell viability. Indeed, cell treatment with ibuprofen, but not aspirin, significantly decreased the viability of HT29 cells by 50% (Figure 4A). We further reasoned that if ibuprofen treatment was reducing HT29 cell viability through Rac1b down-regulation, treatment should have no effect on SW480 cells that do not express this Rac1 variant. Indeed, at these low but therapeutically relevant concentrations, the viability of SW480 cells was unaffected. Only after 96 hours of treatment with the highest concentrations of aspirin or ibuprofen (Figure 4A) a reduction in cell viability was observed, compatible with a general cytotoxic effect at later time points. To test the effect of ibuprofen on normal colon cells, these experiments were also performed in nontransformed human colonocyte NCM460. Neither ibuprofen nor aspirin treatment had any significant effect on NCM460 viability (Figure 4A). These results suggested that ibuprofen specifically acts on Rac1b overexpressing cells. The inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COXs), particularly of COX-2, which is frequently overexpressed by tumor cells [34], has been correlated with the anti-tumorigenic activity of NSAIDs. Moreover, HT29 cells have been reported to express higher levels of COX-2 than SW480 cells [35], and ibuprofen is a more potent COX-2 inhibitor than aspirin [36]. We therefore asked whether the observed effect of ibuprofen on HT29 cell viability correlated with COX-2 activity. COX-2 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to a number of prostaglandins including pro-tumorigenic PGE 2 [34], which was therefore chosen to monitor COX-2 activity in HT29 cells treated with either ibuprofen or aspirin. We found that both drugs significantly inhibited PGE 2 production just after 24 hours of treatment (Figure 4B). Thus, although the treatment conditions with either aspirin or ibuprofen yielded equivalent degrees of COX inhibition, only ibuprofen affected Rac1b expression levels and cell viability. These data suggested that the effect of ibuprofen on Rac1b is unrelated to COX activity. To examine whether the effect of ibuprofen on HT29 cell viability is directly dependent on Rac1b, we generated HT29 cells that stably express either GFP alone (control) or an ectopic GFP-Rac1b cDNA. This way, ectopic GFP-Rac1b should bypass the inhibitory effect that ibuprofen had on expression of endogenous Rac1b, which is known to be regulated at the alternative splicing level. As shown in Figure 4C, this ectopic Rac1b protein clearly rescued the inhibitory effect of ibuprofen on cell viability, although in these cells ibuprofen still led to the reduction in endogenous Rac1b protein described above (Figure 4D). Together, these results strongly indicated that ibuprofen inhibits HT29 cell viability by directly interfering with Rac1b overexpression. Ibuprofen Inhibits Rac1b-Dependent Tumor Growth of HT29 Xenografts. Encouraged by these observations, we next determined whether ibuprofen would also inhibit the growth of these BRAFV600E/Rac1b overexpression-positive tumor cells under in vivo conditions. Xenografts of HT29 cells were produced by subcutaneous injection into nude mice and animals fed with aspirin or ibuprofen in drinking water at doses adjusted for body mass from regular human posologies (1 mg/ml). Tumor growth was followed for 4 weeks (Figure 5, A and B), animals were then killed, the tumors resected and weighed, and RNA was extracted for qPCR analysis of Rac1b (Figure 5, C and D). Ibuprofen treatment clearly restrained tumor growth (P < .001), whereas aspirin produced no significant effect (P = .929). This correlated with a corresponding and significant decrease in Rac1b expression levels in the ibuprofen-treated tumors (Figure 5D). To further support the conclusion of a crucial role of Rac1b in this process, xenografts of the HT29 cells stably expressing GFP-Rac1b or GFP alone (control) were produced and the ibuprofen treatments were repeated. As shown in Figure 5, E and F, a clear reduction in the growth-inhibitory effect of ibuprofen was observed with the GFP Rac1b xenografts, whereas the GFP control cells responded to ibuprofen with a growth arrest equivalent to that observed for parentalHT29 cells. Together, these data show that ibuprofen, besides its general anti-inflammatory effect, targets the expression of alternative spliced Rac1b and this action is the underlying mechanism for the observed growth inhibition of xenograft-derived tumors. Ibuprofen Prevents the Acute Inflammation-Induced Rac1b Overexpression. As described above, we observed an increase in Rac1b levels in patients with colon inflammatory disorders and following acute colitis induction in mice. Because ibuprofen was able to inhibit Rac1b expression and tumor growth in HT29 xenografts, we investigated whether ibuprofen was also able to counteract the acute inflammation-induced increase in Rac1b expression. Mice were treated with DSS as described above either in the presence or absence of ibuprofen. As expected for an anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen treatment attenuated weight loss of DSS-treated mice (Figure 6A). In addition, the treatment strongly inhibited Rac1b elevation in both the proximal and distal mouse colons (Figure 6, B and C, respectively). Discussion. Rac1b is an alternative splicing variant of the small GTPase Rac1 found overexpressed in colon [37], breast [38], and lung tumors [39?41]. In colon, Rac1b overexpression preferentially occurred in a specific subgroup of tumors that are characterized by mutation in the BRAF oncogene [9]. This is of interest because recent transgenic mouse models revealed that expression of mutant BRAF in either skin [42], lung [43], or colon [44] drives an initial proliferative response but then leads to oncogene-induced senescence. The observed overexpression of Rac1b in BRAF-mutated colon tumors thus represents one candidate mechanism involved in oncogene-induced senescence escape. Consistently, we previously described that the survival of representative tumor cells such as HT29 depends on both BRAF-V600E and Rac1b overexpression [9]. It remains, however, unclear how Rac1b expression is induced, in particular because the mere presence of mutant BRAF was insufficient to alter Rac1b expression levels (see Figure 1). Whereas in a mammary carcinoma cell model the activity of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase 3 was able to induce Rac1b [45], it is unknown whether this also applies to other cell types such as colon. One major novel finding of this work is that colon inflammation can trigger increased Rac1b expression. This was observed during experimentally induced acute colitis in mice but also in surgical samples from patients with inflammatory diseases of the colon. These data suggest that stroma-derived signals can induce changes in the generation or stability of the alternative spliced Rac1b transcript in colonocytes. The last decade has revealed numerous examples of cytokines produced by stromal fibroblasts or immune cells, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u00a5\u00e1), interleukins-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and IL-23, which stimulate tumor cell progression in a paracrine manner [15,17]. In addition, tumor cells produce cytokines to which stromal cells respond with the secretion of proteases, angiogenesis, or release of mitogenic factors that feedback on tumor cell survival. These latter mitogenic signals frequently activate NF-\u00a5\u00eaB in the tumor cell [16,17], a pathway also activated downstream of Rac1b signaling [10,11]. Thus, stroma-derived signals may favor tumorigenesis of the mentioned subgroup of colorectal tumors through the switch in Rac1b expression in cancer cells, the subsequent NF-\u00a5\u00eaB stimulation leading to increased cell survival. The molecular identity of such signals is currently being investigated, but preliminary data indicate that the overexpression of IL-8, a previously described marker of chronic colonic inflammation [46] and CRC progression [47], may be involved (data not shown). In this sense, our data indicate that the emergence of Rac1b overexpression may not be the consequence of a second mutational event in a BRAF mutant cell but rather a response of the initiated tumor cell to stroma-derived signals. A second major finding of this work is that ibuprofen has a specific inhibitory effect on Rac1b overexpression. We found in cultured HT29 cells that Rac1b expression and, consequently, Rac1b-mediated tumor cell survival were significantly and selectively reduced upon incubation with ibuprofen but not with other commonly used NSAIDs, namely, aspirin. In contrast, the survival of SW480 cells that do not express Rac1b was not significantly affected under the same conditions (Figure 4A). Although inflammation is a complex process, these in vitro studies indicate that ibuprofen exerts a direct and specific action on Rac1b-positive CRC cells that is not activated by other NSAIDS such as aspirin. Consequently, ibuprofen was able to specifically inhibit the Rac1b-dependent growth of HT29 tumor xenografts. Moreover, this inhibitory effect of ibuprofen was rescued by constitutive overexpression of wild-type Rac1b in derivatives of HT29 cells. The HT29 cell line is a model for the specific subgroup of colorectal tumors characterized by mutation in the BRAF oncogene and Rac1b overexpression [9]. In these cells, aspirin had no effect on xenograft growth, although it has been clearly shown to inhibit the growth of other colon tumor cells, which mostly harbor other oncogenic mutations. Ibuprofen shares with other NSAIDs such as aspirin the ability to inhibit the activity of COX-1 and COX-2 and thus to reduce the generation of pro-inflammatory stimuli. Consistently, we found that under the experimental conditions employed ibuprofen as well as aspirin inhibited COX activity; however, only ibuprofen affected Rac1b levels, demonstrating that its mechanism of action is COX-independent. Because we used therapeutically relevant ibuprofen concentrations that are comparable to those found in patient plasma, the observed reduction in Rac1b is not an unspecific off-target effect but rather an additional mode of action of ibuprofen. Indeed, several NSAIDs were described to have COX-independent mechanisms of action [28,48,49], but how ibuprofen inhibits Rac1b expression remains to be determined. Rac1b expression is most likely regulated at the alternative splicing level and so far no data were reported on any effect of ibuprofen on this process. In one case, ibuprofen was found to increase mRNA stability mediated through the p38 MAPK pathway [50]. Our results are in agreement with previous reports showing that ibuprofen treatment of colorectal tumor cells markedly decreased their viability, both in vitro and in vivo [51,52]. In this sense, the presented experimental data suggest potential clinical implications for our findings. First, the group of patients with proximal colorectal tumors of the serrated polyp type that usually contains oncogenic BRAF mutations is likely to benefit from adjuvant and preventive therapy with ibuprofen. This can be clearly deduced fromthe inhibitory effect on the HT29 xenograft. Second, feeding mice with ibuprofen reduced the experimental inflammation-mediated increase in Rac1b in their colon, suggesting a beneficial effect of ibuprofen in colon cancer chemoprevention, namely, by inhibiting the progression of BRAF-mutated tumor-initiated cells through Rac1b overexpression. It is important to note that previous analyses of inflammatory disease-associated colon tumors found BRAF mutation frequencies comparable to sporadic colon cancer, including the high prevalence in tumors with microsatellite instability [53,54]. Moreover, our findings indicate that the beneficial effect of NSAIDs in CRC may not rely solely on an anti-inflammatory response. Although aspirin has been successfully used to inhibit colon cancer growth on the one hand, it likely provides less prevention against the growth of serrated tumors than ibuprofen. However, the administration of some NSAIDs, such as piroxicam, may even promote this type of Rac1b-related tumor development. Thus, our data imply that the efficacy of NSAID treatment may show discrepancies depending on the subtype of the initiated tumor that is present.

Of special interest is the \u00a1\u00aegatekeeper\u00a1\u00af T315I mutation, which confers complete resistance to Abl kinase inhibitors. Recently, GNF-2, Abl allosteric kinase inhibitor, was demonstrated to possess cellular activity against Bcr-Abl transformed cells. Similarly to Abl kinase inhibitors (AKIs), GNF-2 failed to inhibit activity of mutated Bcr-Abl carrying the T315I mutation. Methods. Ba/F3 cells harboring native or T315I mutated Bcr-Abl constructs were treated with GNF-2 and AKIs. We monitored the effect of GNF-2 with AKIs on the proliferation and clonigenicity of the different Ba/F3 cells. In addition, we monitored the auto-phosphorylation activity of Bcr-Abl and JAK2 in cells treated with GNF-2 and AKIs. Results. In this study, we report a cooperation between AKIs and GNF-2 in inhibiting proliferation and clonigenicity of Ba/F3 cells carrying T315I mutated Bcr-Abl. Interestingly, cooperation was most evident between Dasatinib and GNF-2. Furthermore, we showed that GNF-2 was moderately active in inhibiting the activity of JAK2 kinase, and presence of AKIs augmented GNF-2 activity. Conclusions. Our data illustrated the ability of allosteric inhibitors such as GNF-2 to cooperate with AKIs to overcome T315I mutation by Bcr-Abl-independent mechanisms, providing a possibility of enhancing AKIs efficacy and overcoming resistance in Ph+ leukemia cells. Background. Philadelphia positive leukemias are hematological malignancies caused by a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion protein, Bcr?Abl, with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib, which targets the ATP-binding site, is effective in the early stage of the treatment of Ph-positive patients, but advanced-stage patients may relapse as a result of the emergence of point mutations within the Bcr?Abl. Two recently approved drugs, Nilotinib [1] and Dasatinib [2] inhibit the activity of mutated Bcr-Abl that is refractory to Imatinib except the \u00a1\u00aegatekeeper\u00a1\u00af T315I mutation, which is situated in the middle of the ATP-binding cleft [3]. Allosteric kinase inhibitors hold promise for revealing unique features of kinases that may not be apparent using conventional ATP-competitive inhibitors. Thus, using an unbiased cellular screening approach, GNF-2, a non-ATP-competitive inhibitor, has been identified and shown to demonstrate cellular activity against Bcr-Abl transformed cells [4]. The exquisite selectivity of GNF-2 is due to the finding that it targets the myristate binding site located near the C-terminus of the Abl kinase domain, as demonstrated by genetic approaches, solution NMR, X-ray crystallography, mutagenesis and hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry [5]. GNF-2, like myristate, is able to induce and/or stabilize the clamped inactive conformation of Abl, analogous to the SH2-Y527 interaction of Src [6]. Crystallography study revealed that GNF-2 replaces the myristoylated peptide in the crystals [5]. As expected, most of the interactions between GNF-2 and the protein are hydrophobic. Mutations of three residues near the mouth of the myristate-binding site (C464Y, P465S and V506L) were reported to cause resistance to the binding of GNF-2, presumably for steric reasons. The myristate-binding-site mutant, E505K, was inhibited by Imatinib and Nilotinib, but not by GNF-2, arguing that GNF-2 targets the myristoyl pocket [5]. In this report we showed that GNF-2 cooperated with the Abl kinase inhibitors (AKIs), Imatinib, Nilotinib and Dasatinib, in inhibiting clonigenicity of Bcr-Abl T315I transformed Ba/F3 cells. Interestingly, activity against T315I mutation was Bcr-Abl independent. Furthermore, GNF-2 and AKIs also cooperated to inhibit JAK2 phosphorylation in Ba/F3 carrying T315I mutation. Materials and methods. Cell lines and cell cultures. Ba/F3 cells expressing Bcr-Abl constructs or activated JAK2 (V617F) were previously described [7] and grown in RPMI 1640 with 2mML-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Penicillin at 100 U/ml, and streptomycin at 100\u00a5\u00ecg/ml, was added to the culture media. SupB15, a Ph+ ALL B cell (ATCC, Rockville, MD) was grown in RPMI 1640 containing 2mML-glutamine, 20% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100\u00a5\u00ecg/ml streptomycin. All cell lines were grown at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cellular Bcr-Abl auto-phosphorylation and immune-blotting. Ba/F3 cells expressing the native or the T315I mutated Bcr-Abl protein (4 x 10 5 cells/ml) were treated with Abl kinase inhibitors (AKIs), GNF-2, combinations of GNF-2 and AKIs and DMSO for 1h. Cells were collected, washed once with cold PBS, and lysed as previously describe [7]. Cell lysate supernatants (40\u00a5\u00ecg protein) were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by immune-blotting with Anti-phospho-c-Abl (Tyr245), Anti-phospho-STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 (Tyr694) and anti-phospho JAK2 (Tyr1007/1008) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, USA). The phosphorylated level of Bcr-Abl protein was compared to total Abl or \u00a5\u00e1-tubulin that were detected using Anti-c-Abl and Anti-\u00a5\u00e1-tubulin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). Quantitative analysis of the protein bands detected by Western blot was carried out using Tina software 2.0. Analyses of pSTAT\u00a5\u00e1 pBcr-Abl and pJAK2 levels are given as folds of the sample values versus the \u00a5\u00e1 -tubulin values used as a loading control. Trypan blue exclusion assay. Ba/F3 cells containing Bcr-Abl constructs were plated (4x 10 5 cells/well) in six-well plates, with each well containing 3ml medium. After 24h, cells were treated with the appropriate agents. Solvent-treated samples were incubated with 1% DMSO. Seventy-two hours later, the cells were collected, stained with 0.4% trypan blue solution (1:1), and counted using a hemocytometer to determine IC 50 values. Colony-forming assay. A colony-forming assay was performed as previously described [7]. Briefly, cells (1 x 10 4) in 1ml RPMI/10% FBS medium were diluted in 1ml of 0.6% agar to give a final agar concentration of 0.3% agar. The cell-agar mixture was poured on top of a hardened agar base in wells of 12-well plates and allowed to solidify. Once the top layer solidified, 1ml of medium containing different treatments was placed on top to keep the agar moist. The cells were grown at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere until colonies were visible (2weeks). The plates were stained for 4h with 5mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and the dye was extracted with 1ml solubilization buffer (20% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 50%N,N-dimethyl-formamide, 25mM HCL) for 24h. The optical density was measured at 570nm wavelength with a reference wavelength of 630nm. Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Student\u00a1\u00afs t-test, with significant values set at *P<0.05 or **P<0.005. Results. Since the efficacy of Imatinib and other ATP-competitors are moderate in ALL patients, and based on our previous work showing that the allosteric inhibitor GNF-2 is less active on p185 Bcr-Abl [8]; we wanted to seek efficacy improvement by combination of ATP-competitor with allosteric inhibitors, such as GNF-2. Initially, we tested the influence of suboptimal Imatinib (0.2\u00a5\u00ecM) and Dasatinib (2 nM) concentrations on the anti-proliferative activity of GNF-2 using Ba/F3 p185 Bcr-Abl transfected cells. Imatinib (0.2\u00a5\u00ecM) and Dasatinib (2 nM) exhibited only marginal effect on proliferation of Ba/F3 carrying the native Bcr-Abl (Figure1C). Furthermore, 1\u00a5\u00ecM of Imatinib and Dasatinib failed to significantly inhibit Ba/F3 cells carrying the T315I mutation (Figure1D). The presence of suboptimal concentrations of Imatinib (0.2\u00a5\u00ecM) and Dasatinib (2nM) reduced the IC 50 of GNF-2 from 0.65 to 0.12 and 0.1\u00a5\u00ecM, respectively, when cells were treated for 72h (Figure1A). In addition, in Ba/F3 transfected with p185 Bcr-Abl T315I mutation, which are refractory to Imatinib, Dasatinib, and GNF-2, presence of Imatinib and Dasatinib at 1\u00a5\u00ecM reduced the IC 50 of GNF-2 from 20 to 18 and 10\u00a5\u00ecM, respectively (Figure1B). Interestingly, no cooperation was observed in inhibiting the parental Ba/F3 cells by GNF-2 and AKIs (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and S2). Cooperation between GNF-2 and Abl Kinase Inhibitors (AKIs) in inhibiting clonigenicity of BaF3/p185 Bcr-Abl T315I cells. Anchorage-independent growth of cells is a typical characteristic of the tumorigenicity of cancer cells in vitro [9]. Thus, we tested the ability of Abl kinase inhibitors (AKIs) to affect clonigenicity of Ba/F3 p185 Bcr-Abl T315I in the presence of GNF-2. Data presented in Figure2 illustrated that GNF-2 was active in substantially inhibiting clonigenicity of Ba/F3 p185 Bcr-Abl T315I at 100\u00a5\u00ecM (Figure2A-?-2C).2C). The calculated IC 50 was 25\u00a5\u00ecM (Figure2D). As expected, clonigenicity of Ba/F3 p185 Bcr-Abl T315I was not affected by all AKIs used at 100 nM or 1000 nM (Figure2A-?-2C).2C). Addition of AKIs at 10 nM with various concentration of GNF-2 did not sensitize Ba/F3 p185 Bcr-Abl T315I cells to GNF-2-dependent clonigenicity inhibition (data not shown). However, presence of AKIs at 100 nM showed a marginal cooperation between GNF-2 and Imatinib and Nilotinib (Figure2A-?-2B)2B) and a greater cooperation with Dasatinib (Figure2C). The IC 50 of GNF-2 was reduced from 25\u00a5\u00ecM to 14.8\u00a5\u00ecM, 16.5\u00a5\u00ecM and 13\u00a5\u00ecM when Imatinib, Nilotinib and Dasatinib at 100nM were added, respectively (Figure2D). When AKIs at 1\u00a5\u00ecM were used, we observed a more noticeable cooperation with GNF-2. Presence of Imatinib (Figure2A), Nilotinib (Figure2B) and Dasatinib (Figure2C) reduced the IC 50 of GNF-2 to 10.5, 13, and 3.3\u00a5\u00ecM, respectively (Figure2D). Interestingly, Dasatinib was the most efficient AKI in cooperation with GNF-2 in inhibiting clonigenicity of Ba/F3 cells containing the T315I mutated Bcr-Abl. Interestingly, no cooperation was observed in inhibiting the clonigenicity of the parental Ba/F3 cells by GNF-2 and AKIs (Additional file 1: Figure S3). Cooperation between GNF-2 and Abl Kinase Inhibitors (AKIs) in inhibiting auto-phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl. Next, we tested whether the cooperation between GNF-2 and AKIs in proliferation and clonigenicity inhibition of Bcr-Abl transfected Ba/F3 cells is mediated by interfering with Bcr-Abl activity. Results presented in Figure3 demonstrated, as expected, that GNF-2 is active in inhibiting p185 Bcr-Abl auto-phosphorylation (Figure3A and ?and3B).3B). Moderate cooperation was observed when 0.1\u00a5\u00ecM Imatinib and 0.01\u00a5\u00ecM Nilotinib was used and resulted in marginally reducing the amount of pBcr-Abl compared to control samples (Figure3A). However, a significant cooperation was seen using Dasatinib (0.001 and 0.002\u00a5\u00ecM) (Figure3B). Levels of pBcr-Abl were partially reduced (50%) when 50\u00a5\u00ecM of GNF-2 were used (Figure3B). However, presence of 0.001\u00a5\u00ecM and 0.002\u00a5\u00ecM of Dasatinib inhibited completely pBcr-Abl levels (Figure3B). Levels of pSTAT5\u00a5\u00e1 were also marginally reduced when GNF-2 was applied in the presence of Imatinib, Nilotinib (Figure3A) and significantly reduced in the presence of Dasatinib (Figure3B). Cooperation between GNF-2 and Abl Kinase Inhibitors (AKIs) in inhibiting auto-phosphorylation of the mutated T315I Bcr-Abl. Possible cooperation between GNF-2 and AKIs in modulating the phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl T315I protein was also tested using cell-based auto-phosphorylation assay. Results presented in Figure3C showed that GNF-2 and AKIs failed to significantly interfere neither with p185 Bcr-Abl auto-phosphorylation nor with STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells carrying the mutated T315I form of Bcr-Abl (Figure3C). Presence of AKIs only marginally enhanced GNF-2 activity in affecting Bcr-Abl auto-phosphorylation and STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 phosphorylation (Figure3C). Cooperation between GNF-2 and Abl Kinase Inhibitors (AKIs) in inhibiting Bcr-Abl auto-phosphorylation in patient derived SupB15 cell lines. Sub-optimal concentrations of AKIs were also used to monitor cooperation with GNF-2 in SupB15, a patient derived Ph+ ALL cell line. Data presented in Figure3D showed that GNF-2 at 0.5\u00a5\u00ecM is partially active in inhibiting Bcr-Abl auto-phosphorylation and STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 phosphorylation. Presence of Sub-optimal concentrations of Nilotinib (5 nM) demonstrated good cooperation in inhibiting Bcr-Abl auto-phosphorylation. Interestingly, we noticed greater activity on Bcr-Abl compared to endogenous c-Abl when Imatinib was used alongside GNF-2 (Figure3D). Furthermore, cooperation was more profound in inhibiting STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 phosphorylation (Figure3D) as evident in the combination of Imatinib and GNF-2. Cooperation was also evident in the presence of low Dasatinib concentration (0.2 nM) and this concentration was sufficient to augment GNF-2 activity and to cause a significant inhibition of Bcr-Abl auto-phosphorylation and STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 phosphorylation when combined with 0.5\u00a5\u00ecM of GNF-2 (Figure3E). Presence of 0.2 nM Dasatinib alongside of 0.5\u00a5\u00ecM GNF-2 reduced the relative pBcr-Abl, pAbl and pSTAT5\u00a5\u00e1 by 4.1, 1 and 24 fold, respectively (Figure3E). Results in Figure3 demonstrated that Abl proteins, endogenous c-Abl and the chimeric Bcr-Abl, showed different degrees of sensitivity to GNF-2 alone, and in combinations with AKIs. GNF-2 alone, or with AKIs, exhibited good inhibitory activity on Bcr-Abl auto-phosphorylation, and only a marginal inhibition of the endogenous c-Abl auto-phosphorylation (Figure3A?3A3E).3E). Our data are consistent with observation made by Choi et al., 2009 showing that GNF-2 inhibits the kinase activity of non-myristoylated c-Abl (Bcr-Abl) more potently than that of myristoylated c-Abl (endogenous Abl) [10]. Cooperation between GNF-2 and Abl Kinase Inhibitors (AKIs) in inhibiting JAK2 activity. Our data showed that cooperation of GNF-2 and Abl kinase inhibitors (AKIs) on Ba/F3 p185 Bcr-Abl exhibited a more profound activity on STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 phosphorylation than Abl auto-phosphorylation (Figure3A-?-3E).3E). STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 phosphorylation is regulated by Bcr-Abl and JAK2, thus we investigated the effect of GNF-2, in combination with AKIs, on JAK2 activity. The Ba/F3 Bcr-Abl T315I cells were treated with IL-3 and GNF-2/AKIs, and levels of pJAK2 and pSTAT5\u00a5\u00e1 were monitored. Results presented in Figure4 demonstrated that levels of pJAK2 significantly increased in the presence of IL-3. Treatment of Ba/F3 Bcr-Abl T315I cells with GNF-2 caused a significant inhibition of pJAK2 at the higher concentration used (50\u00a5\u00ecM). Presence of AKIs augmented the inhibition of pJAK2 arguing that GNF-2 and AKIs cooperated in mediating inhibition of pJAK2. Interestingly, phosphorylation levels of STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 were constitutively high and were further increased in the presence of IL-3, while presence of GNF-2 or GNF-2/AKI reduced pSTA5\u00a5\u00e1 to the levels obtained in the absence of IL-3, arguing that STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 phosphorylation is mediated mainly by Bcr-Abl and is less dependent on JAK2 activation, and suggesting that GNF-2 and AKIs are not direct inhibitors of STAT5\u00a5\u00e1. Cooperation between GNF-2 and AKIs in inhibition proliferation of Ba/F3 cells transfected with activated JAK2 (JAK2 V617F) was also monitored. Data presented in Figure5 showed that Imatinib and Nilotinib at 1\u00a5\u00ecM exhibited no inhibition of Ba/F3 JAK2 V617F proliferation (Figure5B). In addition, GNF-2 inhibited proliferation of Ba/F3 JAK2 V617F with IC 50 of 22\u00a5\u00ecM (Figure5A). Presence of 1\u00a5\u00ecM of Imatinib and Nilotinib reduced the IC 50 to 6.5\u00a5\u00ecM and 3\u00a5\u00ecM, respectively (Figure5A). Proliferation of Ba/F3 JAK2 V617F was significantly inhibited by 1\u00a5\u00ecM Dasatinib (data not shown). Thus, we used sub-optimal concentration of Dasatinib, 10 nM and 20 nM, to assess potential cooperation with GNF-2 (Figure5B). Presence of Dasatinib at 10 nM or 20nM with GNF-2 inhibited proliferation of Ba/F3 JAK2 V617F with IC 50 of 2.25\u00a5\u00ecM and 1.5\u00a5\u00ecM, respectively (Figure5A). Next, we evaluated whether the GNF-2/AKIs cooperation also affects clonigenicity of Ba/F3 carrying the JAK2 V617F mutation. Data presented in Figure5C-E showed that Imatinib, Nilotinib, and GNF-2 exhibited a minimal effect on clonigenicity of Ba/F3 JAK2 V617F cells. In contrast, AG490 (10\u00a5\u00ecM), a JAK2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited the clonigenicity of Ba/F3 JAK2 V617F cells (Figure3C-?-3E).3E). The IC 50 of GNF-2 was 22.5\u00a5\u00ecM, and presence of 1\u00a5\u00ecM of either Imatinib or Nilotinib with GNF-2 significantly reduced the IC 50 to 15.5 and 8\u00a5\u00ecM, respectively (Figure5C and ?and5D).5D). Although 1\u00a5\u00ecM of Dasatinib was active in inhibiting the clonigenicity of Ba/F3 JAK2 V617F cells (data not shown), we found that concentrations below 30 nM have a marginal effect on clonigenicity of the above cells (data not shown). Thus, we tested potential cooperation between GNF-2 and 30 nM Dasatinib. Results present in Figure5E demonstrated a significant cooperation between Dasatinib and GNF-2 leading to the reduction of IC 50 from 22.5\u00a5\u00ecM to 2.5\u00a5\u00ecM. Discussion and conclusion. Previously, the Abl allosteric inhibitor, GNF-2, was shown to cooperate with Imatinib and Nilotinib in inhibiting Bcr-Abl [5]. Furthermore, GNF-2 was also reported to cooperate with oligomerization inhibitors in inhibiting Bcr-Abl, as well as in overcoming T315I resistance [11]. Our results corporate the reported data showing a cooperation between Abl allosteric inhibitor, GNF-2, and Abl ATP competitors (Imatinib and Nilotinib), in inhibiting the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells carrying the native or the T315I mutated Bcr-Abl. However, no cooperation was observed between GNF-2 and AKIs in controlling the proliferation and clonigenicity of the parental Ba/F3 cells (Additional file 1). In this report we also demonstrated that Dasatinib, an Abl/Src dual inhibitor, is capable of cooperating with GNF-2 in inhibiting the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells carrying the native or the T315I mutated Bcr-Abl. In fact, our data showed that the cooperation with Dasatinib was more potent than the one observed with Imatinib or Nilotinib. Furthermore, cooperation between GNF-2 and AKIs was also evident in inhibiting clonigenicity of Ba/F3 cells carrying the T315I mutation of Bcr-Abl. Presence of 1\u00a5\u00ecM of the AKIs reduced the IC 50 of GNF-2 from 25\u00a5\u00ecM to 10.5\u00a5\u00ecM, 13\u00a5\u00ecM, and 3.5\u00a5\u00ecM when Imatinib, Nilotinib and Dasatinib were used, respectively. Although we did not closely investigate the nature of the cooperation between AKIs and GNF-2 in the current study, it seems that GNF-2 and Dasatinib cooperated in a synergistic manner which is consistent with Mian et al., 2012 finding who demonstrated a synergistic relation between GNF-2 and Dasatinib [12]. Weisberg et al., 2010 showed that HG-7-85-01, ATP competitor, is capable of inhibiting the Bcr-Abl-T315I gatekeeper mutant. Furthermore, HG-7-85-01 was found to have additive effect in in-vitro and in vivo models in a Bcr-Abl-dependent fashion [1]. Our study utilized GNF-2, and other AKIs that are not active in inhibiting the T315I mutation, resulting in the inhibition of proliferation and clonigenicity of the T315I cells via a mechanism that is not dependent on Bcr-Abl, but rather on an alternative or downstream pathways. Next, we explored the molecular mechanism responsible for the observed cooperation. Initially, we monitored the cooperation between GNF-2 and suboptimal concentration of AKIs in inhibiting the native Bcr-Abl auto-phosphorylation. Our results, presented in Figure3, showed a moderate cooperation in inhibiting the phosphorylation of native Bcr-Abl and STAT5\u00a5\u00e1. Our data are in agreement with data generated using flow cytometry analysis illustrating that GNF-5, a GNF-2 analog, cooperated with Nilotinib to inhibit STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 phosphorylation [5]. In contrast, only minimal cooperation was seen when Ba/F3 cells carrying the T315I Bcr-Abl was used. These results illustrated that the cooperative inhibition of Ba/F3 cells' proliferation and clonigenicity is not mediated by the Bcr-Abl protein, and that probably the two kinase inhibitors target downstream or alternative signaling pathways that control the growth of these cells. Results shown in Figures4 and ?and55 illustrated that JAK2 is also targeted by GNF-2, however, with reduced potency, consistent with the presence of a myristate binding pocket (MBP) within the JAK2 kinase (data not shown). Moreover, presence of AKIs augmented the inhibitory effect exerted by GNF-2. Interestingly, combination of GNF-2 and Dasatinib was the most efficient combination in inhibiting JAK2 phosphorylation. Our data are also consistent with findings made by Nelson et al., 2011 showing that inhibitors of alternate pathways, such as STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 inhibitors, might be utilized as an effective therapy for Ph+ leukemia carrying native and T315I mutated Bcr-Abl [13]. The enhanced activity of the combination of GNF-2 with Dasatinib, a dual src/Abl kinase inhibitor, might be due to the inhibitory activity of Dasatinib on Src kinase which is involved in STAT5\u00a5\u00e1 phosphorylation [14]. In conclusion, our data provide evidence for cooperation between GNF-2 and AKIs in inhibiting proliferation and clonigenicity of Ba/F3 cells carrying T315I mutated Bcr-Abl construct. In our experimental system we used a laboratory model of p190 Bcr?Abl, a variant commonly found in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) that typically responds only transiently to AKIs therapy, arguing that ALL patients may benefits from such combination. Cooperation between GNF-2 and AKIs was not mediated by Bcr-Abl protein inhibition, since the phosphorylation levels of Bcr-Abl and STA5\u00a5\u00e1 were not affected in Ba/F3 harboring T315I mutated Bcr-Abl. In summary, we showed that drug combination of allosteric inhibitors and AKIs, Dasatinib in particular, allows overcoming resistance in Ph+ leukemia cells, including cells harboring the T315I mutation.

                "text": "Variation in Susceptibility of Human Malignant Melanomas to Oncolytic Vesicular Stomatitis Virus\tBackground. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a novel, anti-cancer therapy that selectively targets cancer cells with defective antiviral responses; however, not all malignant cells are sensitive to the oncolytic effects of VSV. Herein, we explore the mechanistic determinants of mutant M protein VSV (M51R-VSV) susceptibility in malignant melanoma cells. Methods. Cell viability after VSV infection was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) viability assay in a panel of melanoma cell lines. VSV infectability, viral protein synthesis and viral progeny production were quantified by flow cytometry, 35S-methionine electrophoresis, and viral plaque assays, respectively. Interferon (IFN) responsiveness was determined using MTS assay after \u00a5\u00e2-IFN pre-treatment. Xenografts were established in athymic nude mice and treated with intratumoral M51R-VSV. Results. Cell viability after M51R-VSV infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 pfu/mL, 48 hours post-infection) ranged between 0\u00a1\u00be1 and 59\u00a1\u00be9% (mean \u00a1\u00be standard deviation). Sensitive cell lines supported VSV infection, viral protein synthesis, and viral progeny production. In addition, when pre-treated with \u00a5\u00e2-IFN, sensitive cells became resistant to M51R-VSV, suggesting that IFN-mediated antiviral signaling is defective in these cells. In contrast, resistant melanoma cells do not support VSV infection, viral protein synthesis, or viral replication, indicating that anti-viral defenses remain intact. In a murine xenograft model, intratumoral M51R-VSV treatment decreased tumor growth relative to controls after 26 days in SK-Mel 5 (?21\u00a1\u00be19% vs. 2100\u00a1\u00be770%, p<0.0001) and SK-Mel 3 (2000\u00a1\u00be810% vs 7000\u00a1\u00be3000%, p=0.008) established tumors. Conclusions. M51R-VSV is a viable, anti-cancer therapy, but susceptibility varies among melanomas. Future work will exploit specific mechanisms of resistance to expand the therapeutic efficacy of M51R-VSV. Introduction. Over 68,000 people are diagnosed and almost 9,000 people die from malignant melanoma each year in the United States. 1 The current therapeutic options for metastatic melanoma are limited and associated with significant side effects. 2?5 These findings suggest that novel approaches to the treatment of metastatic melanoma are warrented. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is one of several oncolytic viruses currently being developed as an anticancer therapy. VSV, the prototypical member of the family Rhabdoviridae, is a negative-stranded RNA virus whose genome encodes the nucleocapsid (N), polymerase proteins (L and P), surface glycoprotein (G) and matrix protein (M). Our group has focused on the M51R-VSV virus, which contains a single arginine for methionine amino acid substitution at position 51 in the M protein, as a potential oncolytic virus. The basis for our work lies in the fact that normal cells mount antiviral responses upon infection with mutant M protein VSV strains while cancer cells remain susceptible to mutant M protein VSV infection and cell death due to inherent defects in antiviral signaling. 6?9 In the work presented herein, we analyze the oncolytic effects of recombinant wild-type VSV (rwt-VSV) and M51R-VSV in a panel of malignant melanoma cell lines that demonstrate varying degrees of susceptibility to VSV. Our data not only establish oncolytic M51R-VSV as a viable therapeutic option for malignant melanomas that are susceptible to viral infection, but they also indicate that there is likely considerable variation in the susceptibility to VSV oncolysis among human melanomas. These studies provide a strong framework for future research to determine mechanisms of susceptibility versus resistance and developing methods of predicting response to oncolytic virus treatment. Materials and Methods. Cells and Viruses. SK-Mel 2, SK-Mel 3, SK-Mel 5, SK-Mel 24, SK-Mel 28, and RPMI 7951 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were grown in DMEM or McCoy\u00a1\u00afs 5A medium (both containing 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine) according to American Type Culture Collection specifications. The recombinant VSV viruses, rwt-VSV and M51R-VSV, were isolated from infectious VSV cDNA clones, and virus stocks were prepared using BHK cells as described previously. 10 Cells were grown in monolayers to about 70 to 90% confluence and infected in small volumes at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) as specified in each experiment. Cell Viability Assays. Melanoma cells were plated in 96-well plates containing 3,000 cells per well. Cells were infected with rwt and M51R viruses at an MOI of 0.1, 1, 5, or 10 plaque-forming units per cell (pfu/cell). At 24 and 48 h post-infection, live cells were measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) according to manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Viral Infectability. The ability of M51R virus to infect melanoma cells was determined by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression using flow cytometry analysis of infected cells. SK-Mel 3, SK-Mel 5, and SK-Mel 24 cells were plated in 6-well plates and infected with GFP-labeled M51R virus (rGFP-M51R) at MOIs of 0.1, 1, and 10 pfu/mL and incubated for 8h. The cells were then washed and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. GFP expression was quantified using a Becton Dickinson FACS Caliber flow cytometer. Host Cell and Viral Protein Synthesis. SK-Mel 3, SK-Mel 5, and SK-Mel 24 cells were infected with rwt-VSV and M51R-VSV at an MOI of 5 pfu/cell to analyze the effect of host cell protein synthesis to VSV infection and the ability of rwt and M51R viruses to produce viral proteins in melanoma cells. At 4, 8, and 12 h post-infection, cells were methionine starved and then labeled with a 15 min pulse of 35S-methionine (200\u00a5\u00ecCi/mL) in a small volume of methionine-free medium. Cells were washed with PBS and harvested in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. Cell extracts were normalized for protein levels by protein assay (DC Protein Assay Kit; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California) and analyzed by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by phosphorescence imaging. Radioactivity of viral N protein bands and background host proteins (two sections from each lane excluding viral protein bands) were quantified with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, California). Viral Growth Curves. The ability of rwt-VSV and M51R-VSV to replicate in melanoma cells was quantified by viral plaque assays. SK-Mel 3, SK-Mel 5, and SK-Mel 24 cells were infected with rwt and M51R viruses at MOIs of 0.1 and 10 pfu/cell. One hour post-infection, the media was aspirated, the cells were washed with phosphate buffer solution to remove all free virions, and fresh media was replaced on the cells. At specified times postinfection, a small aliquot of media was collected and stored at ?80\u00a1\u00c6 C. The viral yield was determined b y plaque assays on BHK cells as described previously. 11 Interferon Responsiveness. Melanoma SK-Mel 3, SK-Mel 5 and SK-Mel 24 cells were plated onto 96-well dishes and pretreated with varying amounts (0 to 25,000 IU/ml/100,000 cells) of human \u00a5\u00e2-IFN (PBL InterferonSource, Piscataway, New Jersey) for 8 h. Cells were then inoculated with rwt-VSV and M51R-VSV at an MOI of 5 pfu/cell. After 48 or 72 h, the percentage of live cells was measured by MTS assay according to manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Controls included mock-treated cells infected with virus and \u00a5\u00e2-IFN treated cells not challenged with VSV. Xenograft Treatment. SK-Mel 3 and SK-Mel 5 cells were checked for animal pathogens (service provided by RADIL, Columbia Missouri) and harvested from semiconfluent cultures. Cells were suspended at 2\u00a1\u00bf10 6 cells in 0.2mL of their respective culture medium and injected subcutaneously in the right flank of athymic C57BL/6-nu/nu mice. Animals were monitored for tumor development three times a week by visual inspection and palpation of the injection site. Palpable tumors were measured with calipers, and the tumor volume was calculated using the formula: volume = width 2\u00a1\u00bflength/2. Once tumors reached a threshold volume of 5mm 3, tumor-bearing mice were assigned randomly to receive intratumoral injection of 7\u00a1\u00bf10 7 pfu of M51R-VSV or intratumoral mock injection with culture medium as negative controls. Tumor volume and animal mass were measured three times a week with calipers as described above. Two mice were selected from each group to be sacrificed on post-treatment day two, and the tumors were harvested for immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemistry. Harvested tumors were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5\u00a5\u00ecm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic examination. For immunohistochemical staining, cells were fixed in descending series of ethanol washes, quenched with 0.3% peroxide in PBS, and blocked in 5% goat serum. Serial sections were incubated overnight with antibodies against VSV envelope glycoprotein (rabbit anti-G, Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, New Jersey). Secondary antibody (biotinylated anti-rabbit; Biogenex Supersensitive Kit, San Ramon, California) was incubated on sections at room temperature for 30 min. Primary antibody detection was accomplished using a streptavidin alkaline phosphatase detection kit (Supersensitive Detection Kit; Biogenex, San Ramon, California). Vector Red Substrate Kit #1 for alkaline phosphatase (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, California) was used to visualize the antibody-antigen complex. Nuclei were counterstained using Mayer\u00a1\u00afs hematoxylin. Negative controls consisted of histologic sections processed with the addition of primary antibody, but incubated instead with 1% goat serum or mouse IgG (Reagent Grade, 0.33 mg/mL; Sigma Chemical, Saint Louis, Missouri). Statistical analysis. A longitudinal, mixed models approach was used to compare experimental groups on mean percent changes in tumor volume over time for the murine xenograft experiments taking into account the repeated measures of each animal. In this model, the mouse was considered a random effect, and time and group were considered as fixed effects. In these models, the time by group interaction was of primary interest, because if this interaction was important, it would suggest that the mean percent changes in tumor volumes in the two groups differed over time. In addition, when the time by group interaction was found to be significant, we examined contrasts comparing groups at different time points to determine at what time point the groups became significantly different from each other. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2. Values were considered statistically significant if p-values were <0.05. The values are summarized as X \u00a1\u00be S.D. Results. Sensitivity of malignant melanoma cells to VSV. The six melanoma cell lines displayed varying oncolytic effects to VSV (figure 1). SK-Mel 2 and SK-Mel 5 cells were very sensitive to rwt-VSV and M51R-VSV under both multi-cycle and single-cycle infection conditions. SK-Mel 28 cells were sensitive to rwt-VSV; however, these cells were much less susceptible to the oncolytic effects of M51R-VSV 48 hours post-infection under multi-cycle infection conditions (89 \u00a1\u00be 8% viability, MOI 0.1 pfu/cell) but were sensitive to single-cycle infections (11 \u00a1\u00be 2% viability, MOI 10 pfu/cell). This pattern of relative resistance to multi-cycle infection was also seen in SK-Mel 3 cells; however, these cells were equally resistant to both rwt-VSV and M51R-VSV (96 \u00a1\u00be 9% and 81 \u00a1\u00be 8% viability respectively, MOI 0.1 pfu/cell) at 48 hours post-infection. This resistance in SK-Mel 3 cells was also overcome by single-cycle infections (20 \u00a1\u00be 4% and 13 \u00a1\u00be 8% viability respectively, MOI 10 pfu/cell). In contrast, SK-Mel 24 and RPMI 7651 cells remain relatively resistant to the oncolytic effects of M51R-VSV 48 hours after infection even when infected at 10 MOI pfu/cell (59 \u00a1\u00be 9% and 38 \u00a1\u00be 9%, respectively). Taken as a whole, these results suggest that anti-viral defenses vary among melanoma cell lines in response to M51R-VSV infection; this observation suggests that some melanoma lines are very sensitive (SK-Mel 2 and SK-Mel 5), others are relatively resistant (SK-Mel 24 and RPMI 7651) and others are intermediate in their sensitivity (SK-Mel 28 and SK-Mel 3). In general, host antiviral responses played a large role in the relative resistance of cell lines, as shown by cells in which rwt-VSV was more potent than M51R-VSV and by the relative resistance to low versus high MOI infection. VSV infectability in malignant melanoma cells. The therapeutic effect of oncolytic VSV depends in part on its ability to replicate and spread throughout a tumor. Therefore, we tested the ability of VSV to infect and replicate using the most sensitive cell line (SK-Mel 5), an intermediately sensitive cell line (SK-Mel 3), and the most resistant cell line (SK-Mel 24). The experiments summarized in figure 2 determined the ability of the inoculating virus to establish infection in malignant melanoma cells. SK-Mel 3 and SK-Mel 5 cells were similar in their VSV infectability with less than 3% of cells infected at an MOI of 0.1 pfu/cell and increased to greater than 83% infected at an MOI of 10 pfu/cell. In contrast, SK-Mel 24 cells were much more resistant to VSV infection with 16 \u00a1\u00be 4% GFP-positive cells at an MOI of 10 pfu/cell. VSV protein synthesis in malignant melanoma cells. The time course of viral protein synthesis was determined in SK-Mel 3, SK-Mel 5, and SK-Mel 24 cells at 4, 8, and 12 hours after infection with rwt-VSV or M51R-VSV using 35S-methionine-based phosphorescence imaging techniques. Representative phosphorescence images from each cell line are shown in figure 3A. Within 8 to 12 hours, SK-Mel 3 and SK-Mel 5 cells supported viral protein synthesis as shown by the intense signals corresponding to viral protein bands greater than the background signal of host proteins. In contrast, there was minimal if any viral protein synthesis in SK-Mel 24 cells. The capacity of viral protein synthesis in each cell line was measured by quantifying the intensity of the viral N protein (the most abundant viral protein) greater than above background and was expressed as the percentage of intensity measured from a comparable region in mock-infected cells (see figure 3B). In sensitive SK-Mel 5 cells, high levels of viral protein synthesis were observed after infection by both viruses. The decrease in overall protein synthesis in the SK-Mel 5 cells at 12 hours after rwt-VSV infection is typical of translation control in VSV-infected cells. 12 In comparison, the intermediately sensitive SK-Mel 3 cells supported less viral protein synthesis overall; however, significant levels of viral protein synthesis were observed following rwt-VSV, but only low levels were observed after M51R-VSV infection. There was no detectable viral protein production in SK-Mel 24 cells over time in response to infection by rwt-VSV or M51R-VSV. The corresponding inhibition of host cell protein synthesis as a result of VSV infection was determined from the same phosphorescence images by analyzing the radioactive signal greater than background in two areas in each lane devoid of viral protein bands. The results are expressed as the percentage of host protein synthesis in mock-infected cells (figures 3C). As expected, host cell protein synthesis was inhibited in SK-Mel 5 cells in response to rwt-VSV to a greater extent than M51R-VSV infection (23 \u00a1\u00be 7 and 49 \u00a1\u00be 7% of mock-infected protein synthesis at 12 hours, respectively). Host protein synthesis was inhibited in SK-Mel 3 cells in response to rwt viral infection (32 \u00a1\u00be 9% of mock-infected protein synthesis at 12 hours); however, there was no significant inhibition of host cell protein synthesis in SK-Mel 3 cells 12 hours after M51R-VSV treatment. In contrast to the other cell lines, SK-Mel 24 protein synthesis was not inhibited by either rwt-VSV or M51R-VSV infection. Production of progeny virus by malignant melanoma cells. The production of progeny virus was quantified in malignant melanoma cells after infection with rwt-VSV or M51R-VSV under multi-cycle (MOI 0.1 pfu/cell) and single-cycle (MOI 10 pfu/cell) conditions using viral plaque assays on BHK cells (figure 4). As expected, the sensitive SK-Mel 5 cells yielded high levels of viral progeny that peaked between 1\u00a1\u00bf10 8 and 1\u00a1\u00bf10 9 pfu/mL by 12 hours under single-cycle infection conditions and by 24 hours under multi-cycle infection conditions. While rwt-VSV produced slightly more progeny than M51R virus early post-infection, by 12 to 24 hours, the amount of viral progeny produced by both viruses was equivalent. Despite demonstrating intermediate sensitivity to VSV infection, the viral progeny growth curves for SK-Mel 3 cells were essentially the same as the highly sensitive SK-Mel 5 cells. In contrast, SK-Mel 24 cells did not support significant viral replication. At 48 hours post-infection, only between 1\u00a1\u00bf10 4 and 1\u00a1\u00bf10 5 pfu/mL progeny were produced, and while single-cycle infection produced slightly greater levels of viral progeny, there was relatively little increase in production over time under all conditions tested. Collectively, these results support earlier studies that show that the M51R M protein mutation has little effect on the viral assembly function of the M protein. 7, 13 In addition, they also indicate that the resistance of SK-Mel 24 cells to the oncolytic effects of VSV is related to the inability of these cells to support viral replication. IFN responsiveness in malignant melanoma cells. The hypothesis that VSV can target tumor cells selectively over normal tissues is attributed to the observation that tumor cells acquire defects in antiviral mechanisms, such as type I IFN responses, as they lose the ability to regulate normal cell growth. To evaluate whether IFN signaling was defective in VSV-sensitive melanoma cells, we performed interferon responsiveness assays to determine how malignant melanoma cells would respond to extrinsic \u00a5\u00e2-IFN. SK-Mel 3 and SK-Mel 5 were pre-treated with increasing concentrations of \u00a5\u00e2-IFN prior to VSV infection. Both SK-Mel 3 and SK-Mel 5 cells became resistant to the oncolytic effects of VSV after treatment with high dose \u00a5\u00e2-IFN (see figure 5). The ability of high-dose \u00a5\u00e2-IFN to protect these cells from VSV suggests that these cells are not defective completely in IFN-mediated, anti-viral responses. Interestingly, less \u00a5\u00e2-IFN was required to rescue SK-Mel 3 cells, indicating again that the anti-viral defects in SK-Mel 3 cells are less potent. In vivo oncolytic effects of M51R-VSV in a mouse xenograft model. In order to test the in vivo oncolytic effects of M51R-VSV in sensitive malignant melanoma cells, SK-Mel 3 or SK-Mel 5 cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of athymic nude mice and treated with mock injections or M51R-VSV. Mock-treated xenografts from both cell lines continued to grow exponentially. SK-Mel 3 xenografts treated with M51R-VSV exhibited slowed but continued tumor growth compared to controls (figure 6A). This rate of growth was different from mock-treated tumors as demonstrated by a time by group interaction (p<0.001). When we examined the separate days within a longitudinal mixed model, we found that the two groups first separated at 21 days (950 \u00a1\u00be 400% vs 5700 \u00a1\u00be 3100%, p=0.011) and were consistently different thereafter (p=0.0039 and p=0.0082 at 23 and 26 days, respectively). In contrast, xenografts established from sensitive SK-Mel 5 did not grow significantly after M51R-VSV treatment (figure 6B). The difference in tumor growth compared to the mock-infected tumors was highly significant (p<0.001). In addition, we found that the two groups were different by day 16 (57 \u00a1\u00be 38% vs 980 \u00a1\u00be 440%, p=0.032), which became more pronounced over time (p=0.0073, p=0.0006 and p=0.0005, on days 19, 21 and 23 respectively) and by day 26, the difference of tumor growth between M51R-VSV treated and mock-treated tumors was ?21 \u00a1\u00be 19% and 2100 \u00a1\u00be 770% respectively (p<0.0001). In three of ten mice with SK-Mel 5 tumors, treatment with M51R-VSV resulted in the complete disappearance of tumor and viable tumor cells were not seen on histologic examination (images not shown). Histologic and immunohistochemical examination of tumors is shown in figure 7. Mock-treated SK-Mel 3 and SK-Mel 5 tumors showed uniform cells with well-defined borders and nuclei. Minimal necrosis was seen in the mock-treated tumors. In contrast, SK-Mel 5 tumors treated with M51R-VSV showed necrosis throughout the tumor, characterized by loss of nuclear staining, increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia, and loss of cellular detail and borders. To a lesser degree, M51R-VSV treated SK-Mel 3 tumors also showed areas of necrosis interspersed between viable tumor, but these treated tumors displayed more necrosis than mock treated tumors. These tumors were also stained with antibodies against VSV surface glycoprotein (G-protein). As expected, viral G-protein was observed throughout SK-Mel 5 tumors treated with M51R-VSV. SK-Mel 3 tumors, in contrast, showed less G-protein staining concentrated at the periphery of the tumor. The areas of G-protein staining in SK-Mel 3 tumors correlate to areas of necrosis seen on H&E staining. Taken together, these data indicate that the in vivo sensitivity of established melanoma xenografts to local M51R-VSV treatment correlate to the sensitivity of malignant melanoma cells to M51R-VSV in vitro. Sensitive SK-Mel 5 tumors promote viral replication and spread, become necrotic, and decrease in size or resolve completely after M51R-VSV treatment. M51R-VSV is also able to replication and spread in SK-Mel 3 tumors but to a much lesser extent consistent with their in vitro intermediate sensitivity to M51R-VSV. Discussion. Our results reveal varying degrees of sensitivity to M51R-VSV in malignant melanoma cells. By demonstrating the efficacy of VSV in several melanoma cell lines, future translational and clinical studies can be designed specifically for malignant melanoma. Before VSV can be used in clinical trials however, several important issues must be established. First, one of the greatest challenges with oncolytic viral therapy is the ability of the virus to target cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. Prior VSV studies using malignant melanoma cells have used rwt-VSV as a backbone 14, 15 which inhibits global host protein production, thereby decreasing the ability of normal cells to mount anti-viral responses. In contrast, mutant M protein variants of VSV such as M51R-VSV are more selective for cancer cells by allowing normal cells to mount anti-viral responses, while tumor cells with defects in these responses remain susceptible to viral infection and killing. Previous studies by our group and others have shown that normal fibroblasts and hepatocytes are resistant to M51R-VSV, 9 while other studies have demonstrated significant oncolysis in normal prostate epithelial cells 13 and benign mammary cells 16 after M51R-VSV infection. Nevertheless, multiple studies including the present study have shown effective oncolysis after M51R-VSV treatment in in vivo models without apparent adverse effects to surrounding normal tissue. 9, 11, 16 Further research will better establish the selectively of M51R-VSV to cancer cells in vivo using syngeneic models and use viral vectors and/or concomitant therapies to enhance VSV selectivity for cancer cells. A second issue that must be addressed prior to clinical trials with VSV is to understand the mechanisms that produce the variation in susceptibility seen among tumor subtypes. A basic tenant of oncolytic viral therapy describes the development of defects in anti-viral responses during tumorogenesis that make tumor cells relatively susceptible to viral infection while normal cells retain the ability to prevent viral infection and killing. Our results suggest that not all melanoma cells possess these defects. Specifically, SK-Mel 24 cells were resistant to VSV infection and did not promote VSV replication or viral protein production, indicating that anti-viral defenses remain intact in these tumor cells. Based on these observations, we can expect that a proportion of melanomas in clinical practice will be innately resistant to VSV as well. In future studies, we will evaluate the mechanism of resistance in SK-Mel 24 cells, specifically the integrity of IFN pathways, and specific components will be exploited in an effort to expand the efficacy of VSV. Several proteins in the IFN pathway are potential candidates for this strategy. STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 proteins have been shown to modulate early IFN responses. 17?20 Viral vectors engineered into M51R-VSV that impede IFN signaling could potentially overcome the VSV-resistance seen in some cells. Other strategies to enhance the oncolytic effects of VSV by introducing suicide genes into the VSV genome have also been described. 15, 21 A final issue that must be addressed before VSV clinical trials is patient safety. While wild-type VSV is thought to cause a non-specific, flu-like illness in humans, it causes encephalitis in mice, resulting in hind limb paralysis and eventually death. 22 Our group has developed VSV variants such as M51R-VSV that are less pathogenic than their wild-type counterparts but retain their oncolytic capabilities. In multiple studies, M51R-VSV has been administered, both locally and systemically, at high doses without associated morbidity or mortality in both immunodeficient (nu/nu) and immunocompetent (BALB/c) mice. 9, 16 Similarly, none of the mice in our study showed evidence of neurologic sequelae or other derangements after M51R-VSV treatment, yet the oncolytic effects paralleled those seen in vitro. These studies establish the safety of M51R-VSV in pre-clinical trials and promote its consideration in future human testing. Acknowledgements. This work was supported by Grant no.

                "text": "Non-Covalent Wild-Type-Sparing Inhibitors of EGFR T790M\tApproximately half of EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors develop drug resistance associated with the EGFR T790M \u00a1\u00b0gatekeeper\u00a1\u00b1 substitution, prompting efforts to develop covalent EGFR inhibitors, which can effectively suppress EGFR T790M in pre-clinical models. However, these inhibitors have yet to prove clinically efficacious, and their toxicity in skin, reflecting activity against wild-type EGFR, may limit dosing required to effectively suppress EGFR T790M in vivo. While profiling sensitivity to various kinase inhibitors across a large cancer cell line panel, we identified indolocarbazole compounds, including a clinically well-tolerated FLT3 inhibitor, as potent and reversible inhibitors of EGFR T790M, which spare wild-type EGFR. These findings demonstrate the utility of broad cancer cell profiling of kinase inhibitor efficacy to identify unanticipated novel applications, and they identify indolocarbazole compounds as potentially effective EGFR inhibitors in the context of T790M-mediated drug resistance in NSCLC. INTRODUCTION. \u00a1\u00b0Oncogene addicted\u00a1\u00b1 cancers define a clinical context in which rationally-targeted drug therapies have been somewhat successful. In many cases, these cancers are defined by the presence of mutationally activated tyrosine kinases, such as BCR-ABL, c-KIT, HER2, and EGFR (1). Consequently, intense efforts have been focused on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as promising molecularly-targeted therapies for genotype-defined subsets of cancers (1-4). In ~10-20% of NSCLCs, somatic activating alleles affecting the catalytic kinase domain of EGFR have been well correlated with the clinical response to the small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib (5, 6). In the adenocarcinoma subtype of NSCLC, nearly 90% of these mutations are either in-frame small deletions affecting exon 19 or the missense mutation L858R. Both of these mutations have been shown to promote the activation of EGFR signaling and a state of EGFR dependency (7, 8). Despite the dramatic clinical responses to gefitinib and erlotinib that have been observed in some advanced NSCLCs, treated patients invariably develop acquired resistance to these drugs, typically around 1 year following the initiation of treatment (9). Approximately 50% of patients who initially responded to EGFR TKI therapy and subsequently develop drug resistance have acquired within their tumors a secondary mutation within the EGFR kinase domain, a substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 (T790M) (10, 11). In vitro studies have demonstrated that this mutation renders EGFR TKI-refractory, while preserving catalytic function in the presence of gefitinib or erlotinib. Two potential mechanisms by which the EGFR T790M mutation confers drug resistance have been proposed. Several groups have focused on the \u00a1\u00b0gatekeeper model\u00a1\u00b1, which was originally described in the context of the analogous T315I mutation of the BCR-ABL fusion kinase associated with acquired drug resistance in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients treated with the ABL TKIs imatinib and dasatinib (12). Similarly, substitution with the bulkier methionine in EGFR T790M mutants causes a steric hindrance, thus preventing drug binding by EGFR inhibitors (10, 11, 13). A more recent report proposed another mechanism in which the T790M substitution increases the binding affinity of EGFR for ATP, resulting in reduced cellular potency of reversible EGFR TKIs (14). Although the specific resistance mechanisms associated with the T790M substitution remain controversial, relapsed NSCLCs with acquired T790M mutations appear to remain dependent on EGFR signaling for their growth, prompting substantial efforts to discover second-generation EGFR inhibitors that can overcome the effects of the T790M substitution. Several second-generation EGFR kinase inhibitors that covalently bind to a cysteine residue within the EGFR catalytic domain (Cys 797) have demonstrated pre-clinical therapeutic potential for overcoming EGFR T790M through increased occupancy of the ATP binding site (13, 15, 16). However, all of these irreversible inhibitors currently undergoing clinical testing, such as BIBW2992, PF00299804, and HKI-272, have thus far shown limited clinical efficacy, possibly because of their potency against wild-type EGFR, leading to skin rash and GI toxicity, which has limited their maximal dosing to levels less than those that may be required to achieve drug exposure sufficient to overcome the EGFR T790M mutation (17, 18). An encouraging recent study, however, demonstrated a preclinical irreversible pyrimidine-based mutant-selective EGFR inhibitor with greater potency against EGFR T790M than current clinical pyrimidine-based irreversible inhibitors (19). Using a high-throughput cancer cell line screening platform to profile 705 tumor-derived cancer cell lines for sensitivity to a variety of validated and investigational anti-cancer small compounds (20), we unexpectedly identified a bis-indole-based tool compound that inhibits EGFR T790M resistance-associated mutants, and was largely inactive against wild-type EGFR. A structurally related reversible kinase inhibitor, PKC412, that is currently undergoing Phase III clinical testing as a FLT3 kinase inhibitor, was found to exhibit potent inhibition of EGFR T790M, while completely sparing wild-type EGFR. These findings indicate that it should be possible to develop reversible EGFR T790M inhibitors for which dosing is not limited by on-target toxicities, and may therefore be advantageous relative to currently available irreversible EGFR inhibitors. RESULTS. The PKC Inhibitor Go6976 Promotes Apoptosis in EGFR Mutant NSCLC Cells Independently of PKC Inhibition. Among a variety of kinase inhibitors profiled for growth inhibitory activity against a panel of 705 human cancer cell lines derived from various solid tumor types, we tested Go6976, a widely used staurosporine-related inhibitor of \u00a1\u00b0classical\u00a1\u00b1 PKCs (Protein Kinase C-\u00a5\u00e1, \u00a5\u00e2, and \u00a5\u00e3), which have been implicated in oncogenesis (21). Less than 4% of tested cell lines exhibited strong sensitivity to this compound, as defined by greater than 70% growth suppression at 1 micromolar (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Dataset 1). Notably, among the identified Go6976-sensitive cell lines, two EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines, PC-9 and HCC827, were unexpectedly strongly growth inhibited by Go6976. We initially hypothesized that PKC might positively regulate the EGFR pathway and that disruption of this regulation by Go6976 would lead to EGFR inhibition and growth suppression in these cells. To determine whether the classical PKC pathway drives proliferation and survival in PC-9 and HCC827 cells, we treated cells with bis-indolylmaleimide I (Bis) and sotrastaurin, two other classical PKC inhibitors. However, these inhibitors failed to detectably affect growth of either PC-9 or HCC827 cells, even at high concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S1A). While all three inhibitors potently suppressed the PKC pathway, only Go6976 induced apoptosis, associated with PARP cleavage (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Moreover, inhibition of PKC-\u00a5\u00e1 and/or -\u00a5\u00e2 by RNAi caused no measurable effects on EGFR signaling or cell viability, (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D), whereas RNAi-mediated knock-down of EGFR, as a positive control, induced apoptosis in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Together, these results suggest that Go6976 promotes apoptosis in EGFR mutant PC-9 and HCC827 cells by targeting a PKC-independent cell survival pathway. Go6976 Inhibits TKI-Sensitizing and -Resistant Mutants of EGFR. To explore the molecular basis for Go6976 sensitivity in PC-9 and HCC827 cells, we profiled this compound against a panel of 442 human kinases using the Ambit kinome profiling platform (Supplementary Dataset 2). Significantly, Go6976 (at 500 nM) exhibited substantial binding affinity for EGFR delE746_A750, T790M, or L858R/T790M mutants, while it showed significantly less affinity for wild-type EGFR (Fig. 1B). By sorting the original cell line screening data on the basis of tissue origin, we found that, among 107 tested NSCLC-derived cell lines, 3 out of 9 of the most sensitive cell lines harbor activating EGFR mutations, consistent with the observation that Go6976 may be especially efficacious in EGFR mutant cell lines (Fig. 1C). In light of the kinome profiling data, we selected 3 NSCLC lines harboring the EGFR delE746_A750 mutation and one NSCLC line with the L858R/T790M mutation for further evaluation. Go6976 effectively reduced cell viability in each of these lines, with IC 50s of approximately 100-200 nM for EGFR delE746_A750 mutant lines and 800 nM for the L858R/T790M mutant line (Fig. 1D). It has been previously reported that the EGFR mutant cell lines PC-9 and HCC827 are very sensitive to erlotinib, whereas cells harboring an EGFR T790M mutant (NCI-H1975) are relatively erlotinib resistant (11). We compared the ability of Go6976 and erlotinib to suppress EGFR signaling in these cells. Go6976 suppressed EGFR signaling as efficiently as erlotinib in both PC-9 and HCC827 cells. Significantly, the EGFR pathway signaling was effectively suppressed by Go6976 in the erlotinib-resistant NCI-H1975 cells, with an IC 50 of ~100 nM (Fig. 1E and F). Taken together with the Ambit profiling results, these findings suggested that Go6976 can directly inhibit the activity of the EGFR T790M mutant. Investigational Indolocarbazole Derivatives Directly Inhibit EGFR T790M. To further explore the ability of Go6976 to directly inhibit wild-type and mutant forms of EGFR, we employed an in vitro autophosphorylation assay using the recombinant cytoplasmic domain of EGFR. We initially compared the ability of erlotinib and Go6976 to inhibit ATP-dependent autophosphorylation of wild-type, T790M, and L858R/T790M forms of EGFR. As expected, erlotinib effectively inhibited autophosphorylation of wild-type EGFR, and was ineffective against T790M or L858R/T790M mutant forms. In contrast, Go6976 was ineffective against wild-type EGFR, even at 10 micromolar, exhibited weak inhibitory activity against the isolated T790M mutant EGFR, and very potently inhibited the autophosphorylation of the L858R/T790M double mutant EGFR-IC 50 <100 nM (Fig. 2A). It is worth noting that the purified L858R/T790M mutant EGFR protein is associated with a baseline level of phosphorylation that can be detected even in the absence of added ATP; consequently, even complete inhibition of ATP-dependent autophosphorylating activity would be expected to yield protein product associated with low level phosphorylation in this assay. These findings demonstrate that Go6976 is a wild-type sparing potent inhibitor of the erlotinib-resistant L858R/T790M mutant. Go6976 is derived from staurosporine, an indolocarbazole alkaloid natural product, and is a relatively non-selective kinase inhibitor. Thus, while Go6976 was originally developed to target classical PKCs, recent studies revealed inhibitory activities for other cancer-associated kinases, including Chk1, FLT3 and JAK2 (22, 23). Notably, some indolocarbazole derivatives have demonstrated greater kinase selectivity, and have been developed for clinical use. Therefore, we extended these findings to examine potential EGFR inhibitory activity for other structurally-related indolocarbazole derivatives that are currently undergoing clinical development. Two such compounds, PKC412 and CEP-701, are small molecule inhibitors that were developed to target the FLT3 kinase, which is frequently activated in acute myeloid leukemia (24). Go6976, CEP-701, and PKC412 share the indolocarbazole backbone (Fig. 2B). To examine the potential activity of these investigational compounds as inhibitors of NSCLC-associated EGFR mutants, we again utilized the in vitro EGFR autophosphorylation assay, as well as cell survival assays in the context of NSCLC cell lines expressing either wild-type or the T790M mutant EGFR. In the in vitro biochemical assays, both PKC412 and CEP-701 were found to potently inhibit EGFR T790M and EGFR L858R/T790M autophosphorylating activity. While CEP-701 displayed some weak activity against wild-type EGFR, PKC412 did not cause detectable inhibition of wild-type EGFR at a concentration as high as 10 micromolar. Moreover, PKC412 exhibited the greatest potency among the three indolocarbazole inhibitors tested against T790M mutant EGFR, and was more than 100-fold more potent than Go6976, despite their structural similarity (Fig. 2C). This activity was similarly reflected in cell viability assays. Thus, NCI-H1975 NSCLC cells, which harbor EGFR L858R in cis with the T790M substitution, are refractory to erlotinib, but exhibit striking sensitivity to all three of the tested indolocarbazole compounds. In contrast, erlotinib displayed some growth inhibitory activity on treated NCI-H322 NSCLC cells, which express wild-type EGFR (IC 50 ~100 nM), whereas these cells were largely refractory to the indolocarbazole compounds (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data indicate that some indolocarbazole analogues, including two compounds currently undergoing clinical investigation, display potent inhibition of the EGFR T790M mutant in vitro and in NSCLC cell line models. PKC412 Is More Selective for EGFR T790M than Irreversible EGFR Inhibitors. The dosing limitation associated with the irreversible EGFR inhibitors currently undergoing clinical evaluation, such as BIBW2992, PF00299804, and HKI-272, is likely to reflect, at least in part, their lack of selective inhibitory activity for T790M EGFR mutants versus wild-type EGFR (17, 18). Since we observed potent activity of PKC412 on EGFR T790M mutants, we directly compared the potency and selectivity of PKC412, BIBW2992, and HKI-272 against wild-type and mutant forms of EGFR. As reported previously, both of the irreversible inhibitors suppressed the autophosphorylating activity of wild-type EGFR at least as effectively as they inhibited T790M EGFR or L858R/T790M EGFR, indicating that these agents would be unable to reach a sufficient plasma concentration in patients to cause EGFR T790M inhibition without the adverse effects caused by inhibition of wild-type EGFR. Of these two inhibitors, HKI-272 displayed significantly less potency on EGFR T790M than wild-type EGFR (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with previous pre-clinical findings suggesting that a relatively high concentration of HKI-272 would be required to overcome EGFR T790M-medated erlotinib resistance in NSCLC cell lines (25). In contrast, EGFR T790M mutants were inhibited at concentrations of PKC412 as low as 3-30 nM, whereas wild-type EGFR was not detectably affected by PKC412 concentrations as high as 10 micromolar (Fig. 3A). It has been reported that pyrimidine-based irreversible EGFR inhibitors exhibit greater selectivity against EGFR T790M than clinical quinazoline-related inhibitors in tested cell lines and mouse models (19). To compare the properties of one of these irreversible inhibitors, WZ4002, with the reversible PKC412 inhibitor, we performed an in vitro EGFR autophosphorylation assay. As previously reported, WZ4002 exhibited potent suppression of ATP-dependent autophosphorylation of EGFR T790M or EGFR L858R/T790M. At most tested concentrations, WZ4002 was ineffective against wild-type EGFR; however, unlike PKC412, at concentrations above 1 micromolar, WZ4002 demonstrated detectable inhibition of wild-type EGFR (Fig. 3A). To extend these findings, we next conducted enzyme inhibition studies with purified recombinant wild-type and mutant EGFR proteins to compare the activities of PKC412, BIBW2992, and WZ4002. All three compounds demonstrated similar Ki values (<10 nM) for the L858R/T790M and del E746_A750/T790M mutant proteins, within 2-fold of each other, indicating that they are all very potent T790M inhibitors. Notably, only PKC412 and WZ4002 were more potent against the T790M mutants than wild-type EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Interestingly, when PKC412 was pre-incubated with enzyme prior to ATP addition, Ki values of PKC412 for both EGFR L858R/T790M and del E746_A750/T790M significantly shifted the selectivity ratio for wild-type EGFR to 92- and 58-fold, respectively (Fig. 3B). Moreover, when we compared off-rates of PKC412 for L858R/T790M and wild-type EGFR in this experimental setting, PKC412 showed a very slow off-rate (residence time of 133 minutes, data not shown) for the mutant only. This suggests that one mechanism contributing to the selectivity and potency of PKC412 against EGFR T790M may be the longer occupancy of the ATP binding site once it binds. Overall, PKC412 exhibited the greatest selectivity for EGFR T790M versus wild-type EGFR. (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). These results provide further evidence that PKC412 is a very potent inhibitor of T790M mutant forms of EGFR and does not significantly inhibit wild-type EGFR. PKC412 Potently Inhibits Ligand-Mediated EGFR T790M Activation in Cell Lines. To extend the comparative in vitro enzyme inhibition studies to cell line models, we next assessed the ability of the various EGFR T790M inhibitors to block ligand-induced (TGF-\u00a5\u00e1) EGFR phosphorylation in NR6 cells (immortalized murine fibroblasts) engineered to stably express wild-type, L858R/T790M, or del E746_A750/T790M mutant forms of EGFR. As shown, PKC412, BIBW2992, and WZ4002 displayed similarly potent ability to inhibit L858R/T790M, and WZ4002 was the most potent inhibitor of ligand-induced phosphorylation of del E746_A750/T790M (Fig. 4A and B). The immunoblot results were confirmed using a quantitative immunocytochemical approach to detect pEGFR and total EGFR (Fig. 4A and B). In contrast, at sub-micromolar concentrations, HKI-272 only inhibited the L858R/T790M mutant. CEP-701 and Go6976 effectively inhibited both of the T790M-containing mutants (Fig. 4C and D). Phosphorylation of wild-type EGFR in ligand-stimulated NR6 cells was largely suppressed by BIBW2992, and was modestly affected by WZ4002, only at high concentrations. Notably, activation of wild-type EGFR was not significantly inhibited by PKC412, consistent with the findings that PKC412 selectively inhibits T790M-containing forms of EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S3). Moreover, we confirmed the reversible nature of PKC412\u00a1\u00afs activity in PC-9 cells that had been selected in vitro for erlotinib resistance and were found to have acquired a del E746_A750/T790M EGFR mutation (Supplementary Fig. S4) by examining the recovery of pEGFR after treatment in a drug \u00a1\u00b0wash-out\u00a1\u00b1 assay (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B). We next examined the activity of the three most potent EGFR T790M inhibitors in NSCLC-derived cell lines, including NCI-H1975, which harbors an EGFR L858R/T790M mutation, and NCI-H820, which harbors an EGFR del E746_A750/T790M mutation. Significantly, PKC412 and BIBW2992 exhibited ~ 2-fold less potency, while WZ4002 demonstrated ~ 40-fold less potency in NCI-H1975 cells (EGFR L858R/T790M) than in NR6 cells expressing L858R/T790M EGFR (Fig. 5A). Unexpectedly, the potency of PKC412 against del E746_A750/T790M EGFR in NCI-H820 was increased by ~ 100-fold relative to NR6 cells expressing the same EGFR mutant. However, WZ4002 potency against del E746_A750/T790M remained the same in both cell lines (Fig. 5B). A similar observation was made in PC-9 cells harboring a del E746_A750/T790M EGFR mutation (Fig. 5C). This cell line also displayed significant sensitivity to PKC412, ~ 30-fold greater than that seen in NR6 cells expressing del E746_A750/T790M EGFR. We then directly compared the efficacy of these various inhibitors in assays of proliferation and apoptosis. Notably, the growth inhibition assay revealed smaller IC 50 variations between inhibitors than the ligand-induced EGFR activation assay (Figs. 6A and 5A-C). EGFR signaling was invariably suppressed at early time points and apoptosis was induced at later time points by all of the tested inhibitors (Fig. 6B). These findings suggest that the mechanism of ligand-induced EGFR activation may differ from that of ligand-independent activation, and that PKC412 has greater potency against ligand-induced EGFR activation than other tested compounds in EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC cells. PKC412 Suppresses EGFR T790M-Promoted Tumor Growth in Vivo. To confirm the observed PKC412 efficacy in an in vivo tumor model, we performed xenograft studies using NCI-H1975 NSCLC and PC-9/ER lines, which harbor EGFR L858R/T790M and del E746_A750/T790M, respectively. We first determined whether PKC412 could suppress EGFR signaling in vivo. Established NCI-H1975 tumor xenografts were treated daily for 3 days with 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg of PKC412, vehicle or 100 mg/kg of gefitinib. Significant suppression of phospho-EGFR and phospho-AKT was observed following PKC412 treatment (Fig. 7A), whereas vehicle control or gefitinib (100 mg/kg) failed to inhibit EGFR signaling, as previously reported (11). We then assessed the ability of these treatments to retard tumor growth. Mice bearing established NCI-H1975-derived tumors were treated daily with orally administered PKC412, gefitinib, or vehicle control for the duration of the study (Fig. 7B and C). PKC412 significantly suppressed tumor growth by 50% compared to control-treated animals at day 12. In the PC-9/ER xenograft study, we included a WZ4002 treatment group for comparison (Fig. 7D and E). Notably, PKC412 did not suppress tumor growth until 12 days on treatment, after which time tumors began to regress. These kinetics of response were similarly observed in the NCI-H1975 xenograft study (Fig. 7B). In both studies, no significant body weight loss was detected (Supplementary Fig. S6A and B), suggesting that the observed tumor regression is not due to accumulated toxicity of PKC412. In addition, immunoblotting of PKC412-treated xenografts (4 hours after the last dosing), confirmed effective suppression of EGFR signaling in tumors, indicating that the inhibitory effect of PKC412 against EGFR T790M was maintained during the course of treatment (Fig. 7C and E). Tumor growth in mice treated with WZ4002 was efficiently inhibited for 21 days of the study. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed from plasma and tumor samples immediately following the final dosing, and revealed a C max of 2.91 \u00a5\u00ecM at 30 min post-treatment, and a plasma concentration of 0.659 \u00a5\u00ecM by 24 hours post-treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7A-C). We extended the in vivo analysis to examine the efficacy of PKC412 in a genetically engineered NSCLC model that develops lung adenocarcinomas driven by transgenic expression of EGFR L858R/T790M. In this study, PKC412-treated tumors were growth inhibited for the first two weeks of treatment, and then began to increase in size at three and four weeks of treatment in three mice, albeit at a slower rate than vehicle-treated tumors (#4212, 3208, 4220), while steady tumor growth suppression during the overall time period of treatment was observed in the other three treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S8A). No significant weight loss was observed during 4 weeks of PKC412 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S8B). Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the anti-tumor activity of PKC412 is well correlated with a significant decrease in phosphorylation of EGFR L858R/T790M of tumors treated for 5 days, indicating that PKC412 can effectively suppress EGFR T790M activity in vivo in this model (Supplementary Fig. S8C). DISCUSSION. The successful development of gefitinib and erlotinib for the treatment of EGFR mutant NSCLCs has been a very significant advancement in the clinical management of metastatic cancer. Moreover, the observed association between the clinical activity of these agents and the presence of activated alleles of EGFR within a subset of tumors has helped to advance the paradigm of \u00a1\u00b0personalized medicine\u00a1\u00b1 for cancer patients. Although these drugs were initially developed as inhibitors of wild-type EGFR, the fact that they exhibit ~10-fold increased potency against the mutationally activated forms of EGFR, which has been attributed to the reduced affinity of these mutants for ATP (26, 27), has probably also contributed to their clinical efficacy. Despite their impressive clinical activity in a subset of treated patients, the inevitable acquisition of drug resistance has prompted significant efforts to develop second-generation inhibitors, especially those that can overcome the frequently observed EGFR T790M gatekeeper mutation. While the first-generation EGFR inhibitors effectively compete for ATP in the context of the clinically-observed activating mutants, the T790M substitution at the gatekeeper position restores ATP affinity, consequently imposing a more formidable challenge for competitive inhibition (14). The need to overcome EGFR T790M-mediated resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib has prompted substantial efforts to discover inhibitors that exhibit increased potency against EGFR T790M or limit access of ATP to the binding pocket. Thus far, all of the reported investigational agents that have been developed to target EGFR T790M are irreversible EGFR inhibitors which covalently occupy the ATP binding site as a means of reducing ATP binding and thereby inhibiting catalysis. Indeed, these second-generation irreversible inhibitors, including BIBW2992, PF00299804, CI-1033, and HKI-272 exhibit substantially greater potency against EGFR T790M than gefitinib or erlotinib in in vitro studies. However, like the first-generation inhibitors, the irreversible inhibitors are also very active against wild-type EGFR, leading to an on-target dose-limiting toxicity associated with severe skin rash in some patients. Our studies have confirmed that BIBW2992 and HKI-272 are in fact more potent against wild-type EGFR than the T790M-containing mutants, and due to dose-limiting toxicity, such inhibitors may not reach sufficient plasma concentrations to effectively inhibit EGFR T790M in patients (17). WZ4002 is a recently reported irreversible inhibitor that displays much improved selectivity against EGFR T790M over wild-type EGFR in preclinical studies (19). Indeed, at concentrations as low as 10 nM, WZ4002 inhibits ATP-dependent autophosphorylation of EGFR T709M without any observed effects on wild-type EGFR. However, at higher concentrations, we found that this compound also inhibits wild-type EGFR in vitro and in cell line studies. Due to the irreversible nature of its inhibitory mechanism, prolonged administration of this agent could potentially affect wild-type EGFR, particularly in tissues where it accumulates. The non-covalent indolocarbazole compounds described here, including Go6976 and PKC412, appear to function as more selective inhibitors of EGFR T790M, which is consistent with a recent study implicating Go6976 as an EGFR T790M inhibitor (28). Importantly, we demonstrated that PKC412 is at least 100-fold more potent against EGFR T790M than Go6976 and is comparably potent with the irreversible EGFR inhibitors, but with 500-fold less activity against wild-type EGFR in drug-treated cells. Consistent with these findings, the in vitro binding specificity of indolocarbazole compounds for EGFR T790M has been previously reported (29). PKC412 is currently undergoing Phase III clinical testing in AML patients with activating FLT3 mutations, and its safety has been demonstrated in a Phase I trial of patients with solid tumors. Although PKC412 is a potent inhibitor of PKC, FLT3, KIT, KDR, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 and \u00a5\u00e2 in vivo (30-33), inhibition of these signaling kinases may not be detrimental to normal cell physiology in most tissues. Similarly, it has been somewhat unexpectedly observed that potent multi-kinase inhibitors, including dasatanib and sunitinib, can be safely administered to cancer patients. Recently, a concern regarding the potential clinical efficacy of PKC412 was raised with respect to its relatively low free concentration in plasma due to its rapid metabolization rate, and substantial binding affinity for the serum protein alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) (34). However, despite these pharmacokinetic limitations, the clinical findings with FLT3 mutant AML patients treated with PKC412 have been encouraging. Moreover, clinical responses were well correlated with FLT3 inhibition, and despite the rapid metabolization of PKC412, concentrations of its major metabolite, CGP52421, remain high (20 to 25 \u00a5\u00ecM) in plasma and may be active against the target (24, 34-36). Furthermore, the direct measurement of PKC412 and its metabolites in solid tumor tissues of metastatic melanoma patients treated with PKC412 at 225 mg/d for 28 days, demonstrated that the tissue concentration of PKC412 was relatively high (median 593 nM)--8-200 times the IC 50 required for inhibition of EGFR T790M mutants in NCI-H1975 and PC-9/ER cells. Considering that the in vitro binding affinity of CGP52421 (median tissue concentration, 1.5 \u00a5\u00ecM) for EGFR T790M mutants is similar to that of PKC412, the cumulative plasma concentration of CGP52421 and PKC412 would be expected to be sufficient to inhibit EGFR T790M (37, 38). Notably, while our xenograft studies did not demonstrate tumor regression in the relatively short treatment window, the tumor inhibition curve was trending to regression at the time when animals needed to be taken down due to vehicle-associated ulceration in the NCI-H1975 model, and significant tumor regression was observed in the PC-9/ER model, raising the possibility that the slow accumulation of the CGP52421 metabolite could yield increased efficacy after a period of time during which an active drug metabolite accumulates. In summary, these findings demonstrate the utility of broad cancer cell line sensitivity profiling to identify unanticipated and potentially useful applications for small molecule kinase inhibitors. The follow-up studies have provided a proof-of-principle demonstration that some selective indolocarbazole derivatives can function as potent inhibitors of EGFR T790M in a reversible manner in vitro and in vivo, largely sparing wild-type EGFR. This suggests that such inhibitors may be effective without the adverse effects associated with the irreversible EGFR T790M inhibitors currently undergoing clinical evaluation, which are also potent inhibitors of wild-type EGFR. It is also possible that these reversible inhibitors could be used in combination with first-generation EGFR TKIs, since the first-generation inhibitors appear to be somewhat more active against the classical EGFR activating mutations, and might therefore be most effective once a secondary T790M mutation has been acquired. Since some NSCLC tumors harbor multiple EGFR alleles, with or without the presence of T790M mutations (8), a combination strategy might be required to optimally suppress signaling from more than one form of mutant EGFR within a single tumor. Lastly, it will certainly be of interest to determine whether structurally-related alternative inhibitors can be generated that maintain these properties while demonstrating even greater selectivity for EGFR over other kinases. METHODS. Human Cancer Cell Lines and High-Throughput Tumor Cell Line Screening. Human cancer cell lines were tested to assess treatment effects on viability using an automated platform as previously described (20). Cells were treated with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM Go6976 for 72 hr and then assayed for cell viability. Cell lines were either maintained in RPMI 1640 or in DMEM/F12 (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO), 50 units/mL penicillin, 50 units/mL streptomycin and 2mM L-glutamine (GIBCO). PC-9 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Kazuto Nishio (National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo). HCC827, NCI-1975, and NCI-H820 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were tested and authenticated by SNP genotyping. NR6 EGFR lines and PC-9/ER cells were authenticated by immunoblotting for EGFR and sequencing EGFR from PCR-amplified genomic DNA. Cell Viability Assays. Cell viability was assessed using the fluorescent DNA-staining dye SYTO60 (Invitrogen). 5\u00a1\u00bf10 3 cells were plated in 96 well plates in triplicate, and the following day cells were treated with a variety of drug concentrations. After 72 hr, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with SYTO60 followed by fluorescent measurement using the Odyssey Imaging system (absorption at 700 nm; LI-COR). Drug sensitivity was calculated as the fraction of drug-treated cells relative to untreated cells. Data were subjected to a non-linear regression model and drug-response curves were obtained using GraphPad Prism version 5.3 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Kinase Inhibitors. Go6976 was obtained from EMD Chemicals Inc. Bisindolylmaleimide I was purchased from Tocris Bioscience and sotrastaurin was from Axon Medchem. Cep-701 and PKC412 were obtained from LC Laboratories. BIBW-2992 and HKI-272 were purchased from Selleckchem. Gefitinib was obtained from Astrazeneca. WZ4002 and erlotinib were synthesized at Genentech. EGFR Autophosphorylation Assay. All EGFR recombinant proteins were purchased from Millipore. 100 ng protein was used for autophosphorylation reactions. Reactions were carried out in 8 mM MOPS-NaOH pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MnCl 2, 10 mM MgCl 2, 0.8 M (NH4) 2SO 4, and 1 mM ATP with or without various concentration of inhibitors. Reactions were at 34\u00a1\u00c6C for 15 min and stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer. Samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated EGFR was detected by phospho-Tyrosine antibody. Ki Value Assessment (In Vitro Inhibitory Enzyme Kinetic Assays). EGFR proteins were purchased from Invitrogen or Carna Biosciences. The protein constructs used in enzymatic assays were EGFR WT (catalytic domain aa668-1210), T790M (catalytic domain aa668-1210); L858R (catalytic domain aa668-1210), L858R/T790M (catalytic domain aa668-1210), delE746_A750 (catalytic domain aa669-745, 751-1210), delE746_A750/T790M (catalytic domain aa669-745, 751-1210). PKC412 was pre-incubated with EGFR kinase (WT 0.006 \u00a5\u00e3M; T790M 0.017 \u00a5\u00e3M; L858R 0.016 \u00a5\u00e3M; L858R/T790M 0.0092 \u00a5\u00e3M; delE746_A750 0.004 \u00a5\u00e3M; delE746_A750/T790M 0.0046 \u00a5\u00e3M) in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl 2, 4 mM MnCl 2, 0.01% Brij-35, 1 mM DTT for 30 minutes followed by the addition of 5 \u00a5\u00e3M ATP (Sigma) and 1 \u00a5\u00e3M Fl-EEPLYWSFPAKKK-CONH2 peptide substrate (Caliper Life Sciences). After an additional 30 minutes (60 minutes for EGFR T790M), reactions were terminated by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 80 mM. Concentrations of substrate and product were quantified using a mobility shift chip (Caliper Life Sciences) on a LabChip 3000 instrument. Dose response curves were fit to % inhibition data using the Morrison Equation. K i values are subsequently calculated using the equation K i = Morrison K i / (1 + [ATP]/K m) for competitive inhibitors (39). ATP K m values for enzymes were as follows: WT 1.7 \u00a5\u00e3M; T790M 2.0 \u00a5\u00e3M; L858R 5.3 \u00a5\u00e3M; L858R/T790M 1.3 \u00a5\u00e3M; delE746_A750 2.8 \u00a5\u00e3M; delE746_A750/T790M 2.1 \u00a5\u00e3M. Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysates were prepared by taking supernatants from centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 g. Equivalent amounts of proteins were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to membranes. Antibodies used for immune-detection of proteins were; phospho-EGFR (Y845; #6963), EGFR (#2232), AKT (#9272), phospho-ERK (#9101), ERK (#9102), phospho-S6 (#2211), S6 (#2217), PKC\u00a5\u00e1 (#2056), PKC substrates (#2261), cleaved PARP (#9541), phospho-tyrosine (#9411), and GAPDH (#2118) (Cell Signaling). Phospho-EGFR (Y1068; Abcam, ab40815), and phospho-AKT (Invitrogen, 44621G). Generation of Erlotinib-Resistant PC-9 Clones. Erlotinib-resistant PC-9 clones were established by exposing parental cells to gradually increasing concentrations of erlotinib for 3 months. Clones capable of proliferating in the presence of drug were isolated and confirmed to be erlotinib resistant. A clone exhibiting the greatest level of EGFR T790M expression and no anti-proliferative response to 10 \u00a5\u00ecM erlotinib was selected and designated as PC-9/ER. Xenograft Studies. All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Genentech and carried out in an AAALAC (Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care) accredited facility. NCI-H1975 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% serum with 2 mM L-glutamine, and 5\u00a1\u00bf10 6 cells were implanted subcutaneously into right flanks of Balb/c nude mice. When tumor sizes reached ~200 mm 3, mice were randomized into three groups of ten mice each. One group of mice was treated with PKC412 100 mg/kg, as described previously (32), another group was treated with gefitinib 100 mg/kg, and a third group of mice was treated with vehicle alone. All treatments were stopped at day 16 because of severe ulceration across the three treatment cohorts due to the unusual required formulation for PKC412 (32). The pharmacodynamic studies for each treatment were performed with an additional three mice after 2 days of treatment. For the PC-9/ER xenograft study, PC-9/ER cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. Harlan athymic nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously into the right flank area with 5\u00a1\u00bf10 6 cells suspended in HBSS/matrigel. When tumor sizes reached ~200-300 mm 3, mice were randomized into four groups of 7 mice each. Each group of mice was dosed via daily oral gavage with PKC412 100 mg/kg, erlotinib 50 mg/kg, WZ4002 25 mg/kg, or vehicle alone for 21 days. Tumor volumes were determined using digital calipers (Fred V. Fowler Company, Inc.) using the formula (L\u00a1\u00bfW\u00a1\u00bfW)/2. The pharmacodynamics studies were performed 4 hours following the final treatment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE. EGFR mutant lung cancer patients who respond to currently used EGFR kinase inhibitors invariably develop drug resistance, which is associated with the EGFR T790M resistance mutation in about half these cases. We unexpectedly identified a class of reversible potent inhibitors of EGFR T790M that do not inhibit wild-type EGFR, revealing a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome T790M-associated drug-resistant lung cancers.

                "text": "Host immunity contributes to the anti-melanoma activity of BRAF inhibitors\tThe BRAF mutant, BRAF V600E, is expressed in nearly half of melanomas, and oral BRAF inhibitors induce substantial tumor regression in patients with BRAF V600E metastatic melanoma. The inhibitors are believed to work primarily by inhibiting BRAF V600E-induced oncogenic MAPK signaling; however, some patients treated with BRAF inhibitors exhibit increased tumor immune infiltration, suggesting that a combination of BRAF inhibitors and immunotherapy may be beneficial. We used two relatively resistant variants of Braf V600E-driven mouse melanoma (SM1 and SM1WT1) and melanoma-prone mice to determine the role of host immunity in type I BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 antitumor activity. We found that PLX4720 treatment downregulated tumor Ccl2 gene expression and decreased tumor CCL2 expression in both Braf V600E mouse melanoma transplants and in de novo melanomas in a manner that was coincident with reduced tumor growth. While PLX4720 did not directly increase tumor immunogenicity, analysis of SM1 tumor-infiltrating leukocytes in PLX4720-treated mice demonstrated a robust increase in CD8 + T/FoxP3 +CD4 + T cell ratio and NK cells. Combination therapy with PLX4720 and anti-CCL2 or agonistic anti-CD137 antibodies demonstrated significant antitumor activity in mouse transplant and de novo tumorigenesis models. These data elucidate a role for host CCR2 in the mechanism of action of type I BRAF inhibitors and support the therapeutic potential of combining BRAF inhibitors with immunotherapy. Introduction. Approximately 50% of melanomas harbor activating (V600E) mutations in the serine-threonine protein kinase B-RAF ( BRAFV600E). The oral BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib (formerly PLX4032) and dabrafenib (formerly GSK2118436) induce a high frequency of tumor regressions in patients with BRAF V600E mutant metastatic melanoma (1?3) and vemurafenib improves overall survival compared with chemotherapy (4). BRAF inhibitors cause programmed cell death in melanoma cells lines by interrupting oncogenic BRAF V600E signaling through the MAPK pathway governing cell proliferation and survival. However, after an initial tumor response with BRAF inhibitor-based therapy, the majority of patients have disease progression. Several mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibitors have been discovered, which can either reactivate the MAPK pathway through upstream mutations in NRAS, amplification or truncation of BRAF, downstream mutations in MEK, or upregulation of COT (5?10) or through the activation of alternate survival pathways downstream of upregulated receptor tyrosine kinases (5, 11, 12). The role of host pathways in the mechanism of action of BRAF inhibitors is poorly understood. The antitumor effects of BRAF inhibitors are believed to be a direct effect of inhibiting oncogenic MAPK signaling induced by the BRAF V600E mutation. However, biopsies from some patients treated with BRAF inhibitors have increased CD8 + T cell infiltrates in their tumors soon after therapy (13), suggesting the engagement of a host immune response in regressing tumors. The scientific rationale for combinations of targeted therapies and immunotherapy is based on the notion that pharmacological interventions with specific inhibitors of oncogenic events in cancer cells could sensitize cancer cells to immune attack, which has been termed immunosensitization (14). BRAF inhibitors meet most of the criteria of immune-sensitizing agents by selectively inhibiting a driver oncogene in cancer cells (15), which is neither present nor required for the function of lymphocytes (16). This results in rapid melanoma cell death in humans, as evidenced by a high frequency of early tumor responses in patients (1, 2), while sparing the function of lymphocytes (16). Theoretically, the antitumor activity of BRAF inhibitors may increase the expression of tumor antigens directly by tumor cells (17) or enhance the cross-presentation of tumor antigens from dying cells to antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, combining immunotherapy with BRAF inhibitors like vemurafenib or dabrafenib is supported by conceptual advantages and emerging experiences (13, 16, 17) that warrant the testing of such combinations in mouse models. Until recently, there was no model of transplantable, syngeneic BRAF V600E-driven mouse melanoma in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice (18, 19). To examine the efficacy of combining BRAF inhibitors with immunotherapies, we have used the relatively BRAF inhibitor-resistant SM1 cell line derived from mice transgenic for the BRAF V600E mutation. This approach has allowed us to test the role of host pathways in the mechanism of action of BRAF inhibitors and to combine BRAF inhibitors with various antibody therapies designed to drive T cell antitumor activity in a model in which BRAF inhibition does not cause major tumor regressions, allowing examination of synergistic roles of host pathways and direct anti-melanoma activity. For these investigations, we used PLX4720, an analog of vemurafenib, with virtually indistinguishable activity against BRAF, compared with other BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib or dabrafenib. For what we believe to be the first time, we show that targeting oncogenic BRAF downregulates tumor CCL2 gene expression and production. PLX4720 treatment reduces tumor CCL2 in both BRAF V600E mouse melanoma transplants and melanomas induced in Braf CATyr-creER T2Pten fl/fl mice. This suppression of tumor CCL2 is coincident with an increased intratumor CD8 + T/FoxP3 +CD4 + T cell ratio and reduced tumor growth. Functionally, this PLX4720 antitumor activity requires, in part, host CCR2 and CD8 + T cells. Combination therapy with PLX4720 or anti-CCL2 and agonistic anti-CD137 antibodies demonstrated significant antitumor activity in transplant and de novo melanoma tumorigenesis models. Scheduling and dosing of PLX4720 was important in the efficacy of the PLX4720 and anti-CD137 combination. Results. SM1 and SM1WT1 are relatively PLX4720-resistant BRAF V600E mutant melanomas.. We first tested the antitumor effects of single-agent PLX4720 against BRAF V600E mutant SM1 and SM1WT1 melanoma cell lines by in vitro cell proliferation assay (Figure ?(Figure1A).1A). The SM1 and SM1WT1 cell lines were relatively resistant to PLX4720, with IC 50 of 8.8 \u00a5\u00ecM and 11.3 \u00a5\u00ecM, respectively. This relative resistance was compared with that of a series of sensitive BRAF V600E human melanomas with IC 50 ranging from 12.3 nM (MALME-3M) to 2.0 \u00a5\u00ecM (HS294T) (Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Methods; supplemental material available online with this article; doi: 10.1172/JCI66236DS1) and the IC 50 of >200 \u00a5\u00ecM reported for the BRAF WT M202 cell line (19). Despite this relative resistance to PLX4720, the targeting of the pathway in SM1WT1 cells was validated in vitro by Western analysis, demonstrating loss of pERK at the highest concentrations of the drug (Figure ?(Figure1B).1B). Since the objective was to evaluate PLX4720\u00a1\u00afs mechanism of action and combinatorial antitumor activity in vivo, we next examined the therapeutic effect of PLX4720 against SM1 and SM1WT1 melanomas transplanted into syngeneic C57BL/6 WT mice (Figure ?(Figure1C).1C). Both SM1 and SM1WT1 melanomas established subcutaneously responded to early treatment with single-agent PLX4720 compared with vehicle control, but the drug was ultimately ineffective in maintaining tumor suppression. An on-target effect in vivo was further validated by demonstrating loss of pERK in the tumors of mice receiving PLX4720 compared with those receiving vehicle (Figure ?(Figure1D).1D). We reasoned that the intermediate sensitivity of SM1 and SM1WT1 in vivo would allow us to test both the mechanism of action of PLX4720 and the potential beneficial effects of treating relatively resistant melanoma with additional mAb-based immunotherapies that improve T cell antitumor function. PLX4720 suppresses melanoma-derived CCL2, and PLX antitumor activity is host CCR2 dependent but CCL2 independent.. Chemokine/chemokine receptor interactions can protect against or promote tumor growth and metastasis, including melanoma (20, 21). A global assessment of cytokine and chemokine genes in SM1 tumor cells regulated by PLX4720 (S. Mok, A. Cass, T.G. Graeber, and A. Ribas, unpublished observations) and our PCR analysis revealed a marked reduction in CCL2 gene expression in SM1 and SM1WT1 cells treated with PLX4720 (Supplemental Figure 1). An AKT inhibitor was without similar effect (Supplemental Figure 1). SM1 and SM1WT1 melanomas were both negative for CCR2 ? by flow cytometry analysis (data not shown). Specific analysis of CCL2 production by SM1 and SM1WT1 melanomas exposed to PLX4720 in vitro revealed a significant reduction in CCL2 release (Figure ?(Figure2A).2A). This reduction in CCL2 production was further validated ex vivo following PLX4720 treatment in WT C57BL/6 mice transplanted with SM1WT1 tumors (Figure ?(Figure2B)2B) and in Braf CATyr-creER T2Pten fl/fl mice with melanomas (Figure ?(Figure2C).2C). To examine whether CCL2/CCR2 may play a role in the antitumor activity of PLX4720, we performed a series of experiments examining PLX4720 activity in WT, Ccl2 ?/?, and Ccr2 ?/? mice (Figure ?(Figure3).3). Notably, PLX4720 was similarly active in WT and Ccl2 ?/? mice but far less effective in Ccr2 ?/? mice (Figure ?(Figure3A).3A). These data indicated that host CCR2, but not CCL2, was necessary for the antitumor activity of PLX4720. Given that tumor CCL2 might normally interact with host CCR2, it was possible that it was functionally important to PLX4720 antitumor activity. To compare the role of tumor and host CCL2, we treated mice with PLX4720 and neutralized some groups with anti-CCL2 (blocking tumor- and host-derived CCL2) (Figure ?(Figure3,3, B and C). In this instance, PLX4720 was not active against SM1WT1 tumors in WT or Ccl2 ?/? mice neutralized for CCL2. These data, in concert with the results in Figure ?Figure3A,3A, strongly suggest that PLX4720 inhibition of tumor CCL2 release is a major part of the mechanism of action of PLX4720 against the partially resistant SM1WT1 melanoma. Similar data were obtained with the SM1 melanoma (data not shown). An analysis of infiltrating leukocytes in SM1WT1 tumors also revealed that CCR2 + cells were predominantly CD11b + cells and CD4 + Tregs (Figure ?(Figure4),4), whereas CCR2 + expression was almost absent on other T/NK lymphocytes. Overall, these data suggested that a PLX4720-mediated reduction of tumor CCL2 release might impact on the recruitment of these CCR2 + tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) (22). PLX4720 enhances intratumor CD8/CD4 T cell ratio and proportion of NK cells.. Since production of CCL2 by tumor cells has been shown to be important for recruitment of leukocytes, including monocytes and macrophages, to the tumor microenvironment (23, 24), we next assessed the TILs in SM1WT1 tumors in the absence or presence of PLX4720 treatment (Figure ?(Figure55 and Supplemental Figure 2). Flow analysis determined a significant enrichment in the proportion and number of NK cells (NK1.1 + TCR\u00a5\u00e2 ?) (Figure ?(Figure5A)5A) and CD8 + T cells (CD8 + TCR\u00a5\u00e2 +) (Figure ?(Figure5C)5C) following PLX4720 therapy. No significant changes were observed in the frequency of total T cells (NK1.1 ? TCR\u00a5\u00e2 +) (Figure ?(Figure5B)5B) or CD4 + T cells (CD4 + TCR\u00a5\u00e2 +) (Figure ?(Figure5D)5D) between vehicle- and PLX4720-treated tumors. Interestingly, we observed a reduction in the frequency of intratumor Tregs (CD4 + Foxp3 +) following PLX4720 therapy (Figure ?(Figure5E)5E) but no significant change in the frequency of intratumor CD11b + Gr-1 + myeloid cells (Figure ?(Figure5F).5F). These data, in concert with the results in Figure ?Figure4,4, suggested that a reduction of tumor CCL2 release after PLX4720 therapy might selectively reduce the migration of CD4 + Tregs into the tumor. Paradoxically, while PLX4720 treatment did not alter the expression of CCR2 on CD11b + myeloid cells (that coexpressed F4/80 and CCR2; data not shown), it did increase the frequency of CCR2 + Tregs in the tumor (Supplemental Figure 3). Consequently, we observed a significant increase in the intratumor CD8 + T/Treg ratio in the PLX4720-treated SM1WT1-bearing mice (Figure ?(Figure5G).5G). These data indicated that the suppression of SM1WT1 tumors in PLX4720-treated mice was associated with a reduction of the Tregs and enrichment of CD8 + T cells and NK cells within the tumors. PLX4720 does not directly alter immune target molecules on SM1 or SM1WT1 cells.. A previously postulated mechanism of improved antitumor activity of combining BRAF-targeted therapy with immunotherapy was an increase in tumor antigen or MHC expression by cancer cells (17). This mechanism may also explain the functional role of CD8 + T cells in PLX4720 antitumor activity against SM1WT1 melanoma in vivo. Therefore, we tested whether SM1 and SM1WT1 exposure to PLX4720 increased the expression of surface MHC molecules, costimulatory molecules, and other surface molecules that might increase the sensitivity of these cells to CD8 + T cell attack. Neither melanoma cell line expressed MHC class I, CD80, CD86, or NKG2D ligands detected by anti-pan Rae-1, but both did express marked levels of the DNAM-1 ligand, CD155; the nonclassical MHC, CD1d; and PD-L1. SM1 and SM1WT1 also expressed high levels of surface death receptors, Fas and DR5. Remarkably, none of these markers were significantly regulated by PLX4720 exposure for 24 hours (Supplemental Figure 4) or longer (data not shown), other than a small upregulation of SM1WT1 Rae-1 ligands at the highest dose of PLX4720 examined. Overall, these data suggest that PLX4720 does not directly alter immune target molecules on SM1/SM1WT1 melanomas, although we did not directly examine specific antigen expression on these cells (17). PLX4720 antitumor activity is CD8 + T cell dependent.. Given the increase in the proportion of intratumor CD8 + T cells and NK cells in SM1WT1 tumors, we next assessed the functional importance of various leukocyte subsets to the antitumor activity of PLX4720. By using antibodies to specifically deplete T and NK cell subsets it was clear that CD8 + T cells, but not CD4 + T cells or NK cells, were in part key for optimal antitumor activity of PLX4720 (Figure ?(Figure6A).6A). These data were supported by similar experiments using WT mice depleted of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and other gene-targeted mice lacking both T and B cells (Rag1 ?/?), B cells alone (\u00a5\u00ecMT), or \u00a5\u00e3\u00a5\u00e4T cells (Tcrd ?/?) (Supplemental Figure 5, A and B), where only the loss of CD8 + T cells appeared critical. Since CD8 + T cells appeared important, we additionally tested the role of their key effector molecules, IFN-\u00a5\u00e3 and perforin (pfp). Mice deficient in pfp or IFN-\u00a5\u00e3 alone responded to PLX4720 treatment like WT mice, but those Pfp ?/? mice additionally neutralized for IFN-\u00a5\u00e3 appeared less sensitive to PLX4720 antitumor activity (Figure ?(Figure6B).6B). These data suggested some redundancy in lymphocyte effector functions, such that a combination of perforin cytotoxic activity and IFN-\u00a5\u00e3 effector function collectively contributed to the optimal antitumor activity of PLX4720. Despite the significant Fas and DR5 expression of SM1WT1 melanomas, mice treated with PLX4720 and mutant for FasL (gld) or that were deficient in TRAIL responded similarly to WT mice (Figure ?(Figure6C).6C). The DR5 and Fas pathways were operational in the SM1WT1 cells, as evidenced by their sensitivity to effector cells expressing TRAIL or anti-Fas antibodies, respectively (Supplemental Figure 6). PLX4720 combines with anti-CD137 to promote CD8 + T cell?dependent activity.. The increase in the intratumor CD8/Treg ratio after PLX4720 treatment and the functional role of CD8 + T cells in PLX4720 antitumor activity prompted us to examine whether PLX4720 might be effective in combination with T cell?based immunotherapies. Recently, Koya et al. described the combined effect of adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) and vemurafenib against SM1 and SM1-OVA melanomas in vivo (19). However, a number of mAb-based immunotherapies that promote CD8 + T cell antitumor function are also now attracting significant preclinical and clinical interest (25?29). Among these, we were interested to examine mAbs reactive with CTLA-4, PD-1, Tim3, and CD137. We have previously assessed these mAbs alone and in combination against a number of transplanted tumors, including melanoma, as well as in a de novo model of sarcomagenesis (30?33). Therefore, we tested each mAb against SM1 alone (Figure ?(Figure7A)7A) and in combination with PLX4720 (Figure ?(Figure7B).7B). With the impact of PLX4720 on T and NK cell infiltration into tumors previously defined, we first opted for a daily schedule of PLX4720 (from day 7 to 11) that was followed by 4 doses of each mAb over 6 days. This experiment illustrated the significant antitumor activity of anti-CD137 mAb alone and the comparatively weaker effect of anti?CTLA-4, anti-Tim3, or anti?PD-1 against the established SM1WT1 melanoma (Figure ?(Figure7A).7A). More strikingly, the antitumor activity of anti-CD137 was significantly enhanced with prior PLX4720 treatment, with the majority of WT mice rejecting the established SM1WT1 tumor (Figure ?(Figure7B).7B). By contrast, the antitumor activity of the other mAbs was not significantly enhanced by prior PLX4720 therapy. Additional experiments were performed with the combination of PLX4720 and anti-CD137, and CD8 + T cells and IFN-\u00a5\u00e3 were found to be critical for synergistic activity (Figure ?(Figure7,7, C and D). Coincident scheduling of PLX4720 and anti-CD137 treatments also resulted in a significant synergistic antitumor activity against SM1WT1 tumors, while pretreatment with anti-CD137 followed by PLX4720 failed to enable any significant additional benefit over anti-CD137 alone (Supplemental Figure 7, A?C). A similar combinatorial synergy was observed for PLX4720 and anti-CD137 mAb against the more aggressive parental SM1 melanoma (Supplemental Figure 8). Reducing the dose of PLX4720 to 5 mg/kg per injection significantly reduced the combined activity of PLX4720 and anti-CD137 using the optimal scheduling, indicating that the dose effect of PLX4720 was important (Supplemental Figure 9). Importantly, we next tested the efficacy of PLX4720 and anti-CD137 in Braf CATyr-creER T2Pten fl/fl mice, in which 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) induces de novo melanomas. In contrast to the transplant SM1 or SM1WT1 tumor models, 4-HT?induced de novo melanomas were significantly suppressed (tumor height or weight at sacrifice on day 49) with PLX4720 therapy alone (Figure ?(Figure8;8; P = 0.0004). Interestingly, the effectiveness of anti-CD137 therapy was also demonstrated, but it had a lower efficacy in suppressing melanoma growth in the Braf CATyr-creER T2Pten fl/fl model. The reduced efficacy of anti-CD137 against these de novo melanomas correlated with a lower frequency of CD8 + T cells naturally infiltrating the tumors (4.41% \u00a1\u00be 1.93%) when compared with SM1WT1 tumors (Figure ?(Figure5).5). Encouragingly, however, the combination of PLX4720 and anti-CD137 showed a trend for further improved activity over either treatment alone (Figure ?(Figure88). Anti-CCL2 also combines with anti-CD137 antitumor activity.. Since PLX4720 in part reduced SM1WT1 tumor growth by suppressing CCL2 production, we predicted that anti-CCL2 might also effectively combine with anti-CD137 against this melanoma transplant. Indeed, a combination of anti-CCL2 and anti-CD137 was also very effective in suppressing established SM1WT1 tumor growth compared with either treatment alone (Figure ?(Figure9).9). Notably, the PLX4720 and anti-CD137 combination was superior, indicating that, as would be predicted, PLX4720 can inhibit tumor growth by mechanisms in addition to reducing tumor-derived CCL2. Discussion. We have used two relatively resistant syngeneic variants of BRAF V600E-driven mouse melanoma, SM1 and SM1WT1, and a transgenic mouse model of melanoma to illustrate the ability of the type I BRAF inhibitor, PLX4720, to reduce melanoma CCL2 production. Gene array and chemokine analysis of treated SM1 melanoma variants revealed targeting of oncogenic BRAF and downregulation of tumor CCL2 gene expression and production. The key role of host CCR2, but not CCL2, was demonstrated in the antitumor activity of PLX4720. While there was no obvious regulation of immune target molecules on SM1WT1 tumors after PLX4720 treatment, analysis of SM1WT1 TILs in mice treated with PLX4720 demonstrated a robust increase in the CD8 + T cell/Treg ratio and frequency of NK cells. Functionally consistent with this observation, CD8 + T cells, but not NK cells, were partially required for the therapeutic activity of PLX4720. Our data are complementary to a very recent study that described the role of oncogenic BRAF V600E in promoting stromal immunosuppression via induction of IL-1 in melanomas (34). Here we broaden these findings to highlight the role of a tumor chemokine, CCL2, and host CCR2, in the mechanism of action of BRAF inhibitors. Furthermore, a dose- and schedule-dependent combination therapy with PLX4720 and agonistic anti-CD137 antibody demonstrated significant antitumor activity in mouse transplant and de novo tumorigenesis models, illustrating the therapeutic potential of combining BRAF inhibitors with immunotherapy. CCL2 is of particular importance in cancer development, since it serves as one of the key mediators of interactions between tumor and host cells (20, 21). CCL2 has been reported to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and survival via binding to its functional receptor CCR2. Furthermore, CCL2 reportedly induces the recruitment of macrophages and CTL and induces angiogenesis and matrix remodeling (35?37). Depending upon the level of expression of CCL2, this chemokine can either promote or reduce melanoma tumor growth (38?42). This type of dichotomy in the role of chemokines on the immune system may be tightly linked to the tumor microenvironment. There will be different outcomes depending upon whether the T cells that are recruited are capable of tumor cell killing or whether they are regulatory or promote tumor metastasis through release of factors that facilitate intravasation of tumor cells into the vascular system. Notably, the SM1 melanoma variants were CCR2 negative, and yet our data support an important role for melanoma CCL2 production in the natural development and growth of these tumors, since these tumors grew more slowly in untreated Ccr2 ?/? mice. Importantly, our results also showed that the BRAF inhibitor, PLX4720, reduced melanoma CCL2 production in the transplant and Braf CATyr-creER T2Pten fl/fl mice and that its therapeutic efficacy was severely inhibited in the absence of host CCR2. We explored the potential mechanisms by which PLX4720 could improve the antitumor activity of mAb-based immunotherapies that promote T cells naturally reactive with and in the tumor. PLX4720 did increase the proportion of intratumor CD8 + T cells relative to FoxP3 +CD4 + Tregs. It is generally recognized that this ratio is indicative of an effective cell-mediated immune response, and indeed, we demonstrated the functional importance of CD8 + T cells in the antitumor activity of PLX4720 in the SM1WT1 melanoma model. We identified that CCR2 was expressed predominantly on a proportion of tumor-infiltrating CD11b + cells and CD4 + Tregs and that only Tregs decreased in the tumor upon PLX4720 treatment. The exact nature of the host CCR2 + cell responsible will require more complex genetics to delete this molecule specifically in CD11b + myeloid cells and FoxP3 + T cell subsets. We also illustrated the ability of a combination of anti-CCL2 and anti-CD137 to effectively suppress the growth of SM1WT1 melanomas. These data are in concert with previous reports, in which anti-mouse CCL2/CCL12 antibodies were shown in 3 different mouse tumor models to effectively combine with vaccines to reduce tumor volume and cure approximately half of the tumors, and the mechanism of tumor control was shown to involve CD8 + T cells (43). Notably, however, the anti-CCL2/anti-CD137 combination was not as effective as PLX4720/anti-CD137 against transplanted SM1WT1 melanoma. The PLX4720/anti-CD137 combination also appeared a promising combination in the Braf CATyr-creER T2Pten fl/fl mice. Our data with the Braf CATyr-creER T2Pten fl/fl mice are the first to our knowledge to demonstrate any single-agent activity of an immunotherapy in this de novo melanomagenesis model. In concert with our findings, when treating similar transgenic mice with anti?CTLA-4, Hooijkaas et al. have reported no significant therapeutic activity (44). By contrast, they report a small decrease in the proportion of various intratumoral lymphocytes 2 and 21 days after PLX4720, but it is not clear in this study how the mock control tumors relate to the PLX4720-treated tumors (in size or days treatment). It is likely that the effects of PLX4720 on lymphocyte infiltrate may be dose, schedule, and tumor size and microenvironment dependent. Certainly, it is possible that the mechanism of improved combinatorial effects may be different in BRAF V600E mutant tumors with higher sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors. Thus far, we have illustrated that when PLX4720 is more effective as a single agent against de novo?established melanomas in Braf CATyr-creER T2Pten fl/fl mice, it also significantly reduces melanoma CCL2 expression. Future mechanism studies are required in transgenic mice to investigate the effect of the role of CCL2 in melanoma-prone Braf CATyr-creER T2Pten fl/fl mice. Two approaches with high response rates for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma are BRAF inhibitors and lymphocyte ACT therapies with ex vivo?expanded melanoma-specific T cells (1, 45, 46). However, in both cases, tumors frequently relapse after an initial response (46, 47). The data from Koya et al. (19) support the combination of ACT with vemurafenib and provide a strong rationale to translate combined immunotherapy and targeted therapy for patients with BRAF V600E mutant metastatic melanoma. Here our data compare the antitumor activity of several promising mAb-based immunotherapies (anti?CTLA-4, anti?PD-1, anti-Tim3, or anti-CD137) alone and in combination with PLX4720. Interestingly, obvious combined antitumor activity was observed between PLX4720 and anti-CD137, whereas no obvious combinatorial activity was noted when using anti?CTLA-4, anti?PD-1, or anti-Tim3. This distinction may relate to the relative lack of efficacy of anti?CTLA-4, anti?PD-1, and anti-Tim3 compared with anti-CD137 or the relative expression of target molecules in the tumor microenvironment in this specific SM1WT1 model. Certainly, we have illustrated the importance of PLX4720 scheduling and dose in generating combination effects with anti-CD137. Whether the use of checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti?PD-1 and anti?CTLA-4, requires different scheduling or other models of melanoma requires further investigation. On the basis of natural immune reaction to melanomas and the ability of PLX4720 to reduce melanoma CCL2 expression, there is no strong theoretical argument to ignore any agent that promotes intratumor CD8 + T cell function. Certainly, anti?CTLA-4 (ipilumumab) (26) and anti?PD-1/PD-L1 (28, 29) are making a significant impact in the treatment of human malignant melanoma, and these agents will likely be evaluated in humans in combination with BRAF inhibitors. In conclusion, the BRAF V600E-specific inhibitor PLX4720 alters intratumor CCL2 levels, altering the leukocyte profile of the tumor microenvironment and favoring CD8 + T cell function. PLX4720 combines effectively with immunotherapies that mediate their antitumor activity via CD8 + T cells, and overall, the data support the clinical testing of combinations of BRAF-targeted therapy and anti-CD137 mAb therapy for patients with advanced melanoma. Methods. Mice. C57BL/6 WT (obtained from Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia), C57BL/6 CCL2-deficient (Ccl2 ?/?) (48) (provided by Michael Hickey, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia), C57BL/6 CCR2-deficient (Ccr2 ?/?) (originally from The Jackson Laboratory), C57BL/6 perforin-deficient (Pfp ?/?), C57BL/6 TRAIL-deficient (Trail ?/?) (49), C57BL/6 gld mutant (gld), C57BL/6 IFN-\u00a5\u00e3?deficient (Ifng ?/?), C57BL/6 Rag1 ?/?, and C57BL/6 Rag2 ?/? \u00a1\u00bf gc ?/? mice were bred and maintained as previously described (50, 51). Mixed background (FVB/N \u00a1\u00bf C57BL/6) Tyr::CreER T2 Braf CA Pten fl/fl mice (Braf CATyr-creER T2Pten fl/fl mice) were bred and maintained as previously described (52). Cell lines. The SM1 mouse melanoma was generated from a spontaneously arising tumor in BRAF V600E mutant transgenic mice (19). Sequencing of the hot spot T1799A mutation in BRAF demonstrated the presence of the BRAF V600E transversion in SM1 cells, and whole-genome copy number analysis demonstrated frequent deletions and amplifications consistent with human melanomas. In particular, SM1 has been shown to have a deletion of CDKN2A and amplification of BRAF and MITF genes (19). A variant of SM1, SM1WT1, was developed by subcutaneous injection of an in vivo?passaged SM1 tumor into B6 WT male mice, and this tumor was harvested, cut into small pieces, and digested to single cell suspension. These tumor cells were cultured in 10% FCS-supplemented RPMI 1640 complete media (2 mM l-glutamine [Gibco], 1% (v/v) penicillin, and streptomycin [Gibco]) in 5% CO 2. After 6 passages, the SM1WT1 cell line was generated. When used in vitro, SM1 and the variant SM1WT1 were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with complete media (Gibco). Reagents. The type I BRAF inhibitor, PLX4720, was obtained from Plexxikon Inc. It was dissolved in DMSO (Calbiochem) and used for in vitro studies as previously described (53). For in vivo studies, PLX4720 was dissolved in DMSO, followed by PBS (100 \u00a5\u00ecl), which was then injected daily i.p. into mice at 20 mg/kg. This i.p. dosing regimen for PLX4720 has been demonstrated to have adequate pharmacokinetic parameters in blood (54). Anti?CTLA-4 (CD152) (antagonistic, UC10-4F10; provided by Jeffrey Bluestone, UCSF, San Francisco, California, USA), anti?PD-1 (CD279) (antagonistic, RMP1-14), anti-Tim3 (antagonistic, RMT3-23), anti-CD137 (agonistic, 3H3), and control Ig (cIg; Mac-4) were generated as previously described (30, 31) and used at the indicated schedule/dosage. Some mice were depleted of T or NK cell subsets with anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-CD8\u00a5\u00e2 (53.5.8), or anti-asialoGM1 (Wako Pure Chemical) or neutralized for IFN-\u00a5\u00e3 (H22) or CCL2 (123616) as previously described (32, 55). Cell proliferation assays. Cell proliferation assays were prepared in 96-well plates (5 replicate wells per drug concentration). Plates were incubated for 48 hours prior to drug treatment and treated with a range of PLX4720 concentrations for a further 72 hours. PLX4720 stock solutions were prepared in DMSO, stored at ?20\u00a1\u00c6C, and diluted as required. Cell number was determined at the end of drug treatment using the sulforhodamine B method described previously (56). SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting. For cultured cell lysates, cells were seeded in 10-cm tissue culture dishes and incubated for 24 hours prior to drug treatment, after which plates were treated with various PLX4720 concentrations for 6 hours. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), sodium fluoride, sodium vanadate, and PMSF. For tumor xenograft lysates, tumors were harvested from mice prior to drug treatment or after 4 days of PLX4720 treatment and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tumors were crushed in liquid nitrogen and lysed using RIPA lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), sodium fluoride, sodium vanadate, and PMSF. Protein concentrations were determined using the DC assay (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates (15 \u00a5\u00ecg protein) were separated on 12% bis-tris SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride using a semidry transblotter (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with anti?p44/42-MAPK (ERK; CS9102) and anti?phospho-p44/42-MAPK (ERK-Thr202/Tyr204; CS9101) primary antibodies (purchased from Cell Signaling Technology), and even loading was confirmed using an anti-actin primary antibody (08691002; purchased from MP Biomedicals). Protein bands were visualized using Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent. Melanoma therapy models.  Transplant models.. SM1 or SM1WT1 cells were inoculated subcutaneously on the hind flank with the indicated number of cells, and tumor size was monitored by measuring the product of the shortest and longest tumor diameters. At various time points, indicated mice received 20 mg/kg PLX4720 i.p. or an equivalent volume of vehicle DMSO. In some experiments, mice were comparatively treated with 20 \u00a5\u00ecg cIg or anti-CCL2 (clone 123616) as indicated. Some groups of mice additionally received cIg (Mac-4), anti?CTLA-4, anti?PD-1, anti-Tim3, or anti-CD137 i.p. using the schedules outlined.  Spontaneous model.. 4-HT solution was prepared in DMSO as previously described (52). 4-HT was applied topically on the back skin of Braf CATyr-creER T2Pten fl/fl mice to induce localized melanoma. Mice harboring established melanoma (day 28; size ~20 mm 2) were treated daily with 20 mg/kg PLX4720 i.p. or an equivalent volume of vehicle DMSO at days 28?49. Some groups of mice additionally received cIg or anti-CD137 (100 \u00a5\u00ecg) i.p. on days 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48. Mice were then monitored for melanoma development, and data were recorded as the growth curves of individual mice with tumors in each group. Measurements were made with a caliper and reference ruler for height of tumors (mm) weekly for 3 weeks. At indicated time points, tumors were weighted and recorded (g) for individual mice in each group. Measuring CCL2 and other chemokines by CBA.  In vitro.. 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 SM1 and SM1WT1 cells were plated in a 96-well plate and treated with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 or an equivalent volume of vehicle DMSO. Supernatants were harvested from PLX4720- or vehicle-treated culture after 18 to 24 hours.  Ex vivo.. Tumor suspension was prepared as previously described (30). Tumor suspension was plated in a 96-well plate at 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells per well. Supernatant was harvested after 18 to 24 hours of in vitro culture. Quantitative real-time PCR. 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 SM1 or SM1WT1 cells, treated with vehicle or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720, were harvested after 24-hour culture in a replicate of 5 wells. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA were synthesized from 1 \u00a5\u00ecg of RNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol. Quantitative PCR for CCL2 and HPRT expression was performed on the Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem) with Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies). Primer sequences to CCL2 (5\u00a1\u00c7-GCATCCACTACCTTTTCCACAACC-3\u00a1\u00c7; 5\u00a1\u00c7-ACAGTCCGAGTCACACTAGTTCAC-3\u00a1\u00c7) and HPRT (5\u00a1\u00c7-GACACAAACGTGATTCAAATCC-3\u00a1\u00c7; 5\u00a1\u00c7-CTCTCGAAGTGTTGGATACAG-3\u00a1\u00c7) were used. Threshold cycle (Ct) was measured, and relative gene expression of CCL2 was calculated using the \u00a5\u00c4\u00a5\u00c4Ct method relative to HPRT. Flow cytometry analysis. Larger tumors were treated and assessed to enable sufficient TILs (TILs) for examination. SM1WT1 tumors were excised from mice and processed for flow cytometry analysis as previously described (30). In brief, tumors were minced and digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase IV (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and 0.02 mg/ml DNaseI (Roche) to prepare single cell suspensions. For surface staining, TILs were stained with FITC-anti-Ly6G (Gr-1) (RB6-8C5, BD Pharmingen), FITC-anti-NK1.1 (PK136, eBioscience), PE-anti-CD11b (3A33, Southern Biotech), PE-anti-CD8\u00a5\u00e1 (53-6.7, eBioscience), PE-Cy7-anti-CD4 (RM4-5, BD Pharmingen), Strepavidin-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience), APC-anti-TCR\u00a5\u00e2 (H57-597, eBioscience), APC-anti-CD11c (N418, eBioscience), APC-anti-CCR2 (R&D Systems), APC-eFluor780-anti-CD45.2 (104, eBioscience), eFluor 450-anti-CD3 (17A2, eBioscience), eFluor 450-anti-CD19 (eBio1D3, eBioscience), and biotin-anti-F4/80 (BM8, eBioscience) in the presence of anti-CD16/32 (2.4G2). 7AAD (BD Pharmingen) was used to exclude dead cells. For intracellular staining, TILs were fixed and permeabilized using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience), according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol, and stained using eFluor 450-anti-Foxp3 (FJK-16s, eBioscience). Cells were acquired on the LSR-II (BD Biosciences), and analysis was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star). Statistics. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism (version 5) software (GraphPad Software). Significant differences among groups were assessed by a 2-tailed t test or Mann-Whitney U test, as indicated. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. Study approval. All mouse experiments were performed with approval from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Animal Experimental Ethics Committee. Supplementary Material. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Combined targeting of MEK and PI3K/mTOR effector pathways is necessary to effectively inhibit NRAS mutant melanoma in vitro and in vivo\tActivating mutations in the neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) gene are common genetic events in malignant melanoma being found in 15?25% of cases. NRAS is thought to activate both mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K signaling in melanoma cells. We studied the influence of different components on the MAP/extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) kinase (MEK) and PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-signaling cascade in NRAS mutant melanoma cells. In general, these cells were more sensitive to MEK inhibition compared with inhibition in the PI3K/mTOR cascade. Combined targeting of MEK and PI3K was superior to MEK and mTOR 1,2 inhibition in all NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines tested, suggesting that PI3K signaling is more important for cell survival in NRAS mutant melanoma when MEK is inhibited. However, targeting of PI3K/mTOR 1,2 in combination with MEK inhibitors is necessary to effectively abolish growth of NRAS mutant melanoma cells in vitro and regress xenografted NRAS mutant melanoma. Furthermore, we showed that MEK and PI3K/mTOR 1,2 inhibition is synergistic. Expression analysis confirms that combined MEK and PI3K/mTOR 1,2 inhibition predominantly influences genes in the rat sarcoma (RAS) pathway and growth factor receptor pathways, which signal through MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR, respectively. Our results suggest that combined targeting of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways has antitumor activity and might serve as a therapeutic option in the treatment of NRAS mutant melanoma, for which there are currently no effective therapies. Oncogenic mutations in codons 12, 13, or 61 of the rat sarcoma (RAS) family of small GTPases, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (HRAS), and neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) occur in approximately one-third of all human cancers with NRAS mutations found in about 15?20% of melanomas (1?7). Mutated RAS proteins activate signaling pathways that promote the cell division cycle and cell growth and suppress apoptosis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of NRAS in melanoma cell lines inhibits proliferation and renders cells sensitive to chemotherapy, making mutant NRAS and its signaling effectors relevant targets for melanoma therapy (8, 9). Efforts at developing therapeutics that inhibit mutant RAS directly have so far not been successful. The high affinity of RAS for GTP and the high concentrations of GTP intracellularly has meant that the identification of small molecules, which selectively prevent accumulation of RAS-GTP, has not been possible (10). Targeting mutant NRAS with siRNA is still limited to preclinical models because of the significant challenge in delivering antisense oligonucleotides in vivo. The response of NRAS mutant melanoma and other melanomas to various chemotherapeutic regiments has been very scarce with only 6% of patients responding (11). Alternatively, farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) were thought to inhibit RAS activation by blocking farnesylation, a key posttranslational modification step of RAS that is essential for RAS function. One FTI, R115777 (also known as tipifarnib), was evaluated in a single-agent, single-arm phase II trial in patients with metastatic melanoma. The lack of responses among the first 14 patients led to the early closure of the trial. A paucity of efficacy has also been observed for this approach in other RAS-mutated malignancies. Recently, an oral mitogen activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor (MEK162) was tested in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) or NRAS mutations with encouraging results (12). In this study, we evaluate in detail NRAS mutant primary melanomas, melanoma metastases, and 10 human NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines. The expression and role of MEK/ERK and PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phospho-proteins in viability, growth, and therapeutics of NRAS mutant melanoma tumors are assessed. Our data show that combined targeting of MEK and PI3K/mTOR 1,2 is necessary to regress NRAS mutant melanoma, thus opening the possibility of a beneficial treatment strategy. Results.  NRAS Mutant Melanoma Activates the MEK/ERK, the PI3K/mTOR Pathway, or both.. Levels of phospho-ERK, p-MEK phospho-murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (p-AKT), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were measured in 14 primary melanomas and 18 metastases from 32 patient specimens of NRAS-mutated melanoma. Sample information, including mutation status, is provided in Table S1. Protein levels were measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and evaluated as the average rating of staining intensity by four independent reviewers on a scale from 3 = +++ positive to 0 = negative. Analysis of inter- and intrarater reliability can be found in Fig. S1. Across all patients, tumors displayed the strongest staining for p-ERK (1.34 \u00a1\u00be 0.14) and p-S6 (1.16 \u00a1\u00be 0.12). Comparing the staining patterns between patients, scoring results were divided into quartiles. Negative staining was defined as a score \u00a1\u00c20.75 (quartile 1), and positive staining was defined as a score >0.75 (quartile 2, 3, 4). Positive staining for p-ERK or p-S6 or both was found in 95.24% of samples stained, with 42.86% of patients positive for both proteins, 28.57% positive only for p-MEK, and 23.81% positive only for p-S6 (Fig. 1). In 28.6% of patient samples, p-ERK/p-MEK staining was negative. This was predominantly the case in melanoma metastasis although it was not statistically significant; 57.9% of slides expressed PTEN, with an average staining intensity of 0.8 \u00a1\u00be 0.13, and 38.9% of slides expressed p-ATK with an average staining intensity of 0.57 \u00a1\u00be 0.12.  NRAS Mutant Melanoma Cell Lines Are More Sensitive to Inhibition in the MEK/ERK than in the PI3K/mTOR Cascade.. Ten NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines?3 of which harbored mutations in G12, 1 in G13, and 6 in Q61?were tested for growth inhibition in response to inhibitors in the MEK/ERK and the PI3K/mTOR pathways. Three cell lines presented with additional, low-activating BRAF mutations (G469E, D549G, D594N) (Table S2) (13). However, none of the three cell lines displayed a decrease in cell viability or changes in signaling cascades in response to a BRAF inhibitor. Moreover, siRNA directed against mutant NRAS(G13D) decreased cell viability in MaMel30I cells bearing the NRAS(G13D) mutation, demonstrating dependence on NRAS signaling (Fig. S2). All cell lines were more sensitive to MEK inhibitors (MEKi) (JTP-74057, PD325901) than to inhibitors in the PI3K/mTOR cascade. At equimolar concentrations, the MEKi JTP-74057 displayed greater growth inhibition compared with the MEKi PD325901 [mean fold difference at 50% growth inhibition (GI50) = 4.6 \u00a1\u00be 2.8]. Growth inhibition with single inhibitors against PI3K (GDC-0941), AKT (GSK690693), mTOR 1 (rapamycin), and mTOR 1,2 (PP242) was weak. Of those inhibitors, mTORi 1,2 and PI3Ki were the strongest. AKTi and rapamycin did not reduce cell viability with concentrations used in this study. Incubation with inhibitors against PI3K/mTOR 1,2, the most potent inhibitors of viability in the PI3K/mTOR cascade, decreased cell growth in all cells tested (Fig. 2). Values GI50 are displayed in Tables S3 and S4. Immunoblot analyses showed a dose-dependent reduction of p-ERK with MEKi in all cell lines and a reduction in p-S6 levels in MM485, MM415, and Sk-Mel-2 cells. MEKi further induced p-AKT expression in MM485, MM415, WM1366, WM3629, and WM3670 cells. PI3K/mTORi 1,2 reduced phosphoprotein levels of AKT and S6 in a dose-dependent manner and resulted in slight induction of p-ERK expression in MM485, MM415, WM1366, WM3629, WM3670, and MaMel30I cells (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3).  Combination of MEK and PI3K/mTOR 1,2 Inhibitors Is Most Effective in Reducing Cell Viability in NRAS Mutant Melanoma.. We further examined the growth inhibitory effect of different combinations of selective inhibitors. Combining a MEKi with a PI3Ki, mTORi 1, mTORi 1,2, or AKTi resulted in greater growth inhibition than with a MEKi alone in all cell lines. The combination of MEKi+PI3Ki was superior to combinations of MEKi with mTORi 1, mTORi 1,2, or AKTi. However, the strongest decrease in cell viability was seen with MEKi+PI3K/mTORi 1,2 (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3). As expected, immunoblot analyses revealed \u00a1\u00b0paradoxical\u00a1\u00b1 AKT hyperphosphorylation when cells were treated with the AKTi. This previously described effect is not due to enhancement of upstream signals to compensate for AKT signal loss, but rather is related to occupation of the AKT nucleotide-binding pocket by the AKT inhibitor (14,15). We further found that MEKi+mTORi 1,2 reduced levels of p-S6 more potently than MEKi+PI3Ki. Interestingly, the latter has a stronger effect in the reduction of viability in NRAS cell lines. Only the combination of MEKi and PI3K/mTORi 1,2 showed complete suppression of p-ERK, p-AKT, and p-S6 in D04, MaMel30I, MM485, WM3670, WM3060, and WM1366 and almost complete suppression in Sk-Mel-2 and WM3629 cells (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3).  Combined Inhibition of MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR Pathways Induces Apoptosis in NRAS Mutant Melanoma Cells.. To evaluate if growth inhibition induced with single or combination treatment is due to apoptosis, we determined the number of cells with phosphatidyl serine exposed outside the cell membrane by labeling with an Annexin V-FITC antibody. Cells with loss of membrane integrity, reflecting the latest stage of cell death, were identified by propidium iodide (PI) staining. Results confirmed that the reduction of cell count in viability assays is a result of apoptosis (16). MEK or PI3K/mTOR 1,2 inhibition alone was not sufficient in inducing apoptosis to the same extent as the combination treatment in NRAS mutant cell lines after 24 h of incubation. Immunoblot analyses for cleaved caspase 3 and luminescent assays for caspase 3 and 7 activity further support the induction of apoptosis by the combination of MEKi+PI3K/mTORi 1,2 (Fig. 4 and Fig. S4).  Oral Dosing with the Combination of MEK and PI3K/mTOR 1,2 Inhibitors Results in Tumor Size Reduction in a Nude Mouse Xenograft Model.. Concluding from our in vitro data, we hypothesized that the preferential reduction in cell growth and induction of apoptosis with the MEKi+PI3K/mTORi 1,2 in NRAS mutant cells might also be effective in inhibiting tumor growth and inducing tumor reduction in vivo. To evaluate this, we tested a MEKi, a PI3Ki, a PI3K/mTORi 1,2, and their combinations in a nude mouse NRAS mutant xenograft tumor model. NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines D04, MaMel30I, MM485, Sk-Mel-2, and WM3629 gave rise to tumors within 4?6 wk after injection, and treatment was established when tumors reached a volume of about 100 mm 3 (Fig. 5, arrow). Single-drug treatment with a PI3Ki alone did not alter tumor growth (Fig. S5). Treatment with either MEKi or PI3K/mTORi 1,2 slightly decreased or stabilized tumors in all cell lines. The combination MEKi+PI3K/mTORi 1,2 resulted in significant tumor regression after 5 d of treatment (P < 0.05: comparison of the combination to either MEKi or PI3K/mTORi 1,2 alone). We observed one complete response in a mouse bearing tumors with cell line MaMel30I. Weight loss, periorificial redness, and dry skin was noted in mice treated with MEKi+PI3K/mTORi 1,2. Target inhibition was assessed by immunoblotting of tumor tissue. Treatment with the MEKi alone reduced p-MEK and p-ERK expression. The PI3K/mTORi 1,2 completely inhibited p-AKT expression whereas levels of p-MEK and p-ERK were unchanged. Phospho S6 was suppressed with the PI3K/mTORi 1,2 and reduced with the MEKi. In contrast, the combination treatment potently suppressed p-MEK, p-ERK, p-AKT, and p-S6 expression in D04 and WM3629 tumors (Fig. 6) and markedly reduced phosphoprotein levels in MM485, MaMel30I, and Sk-Mel-2 tumors (Fig. S6). Apoptosis was confirmed by elevated levels of cleaved caspase 3 in tumors treated with the combination therapy.  MEK and PI3K/mTOR 1,2 Inhibition Is Synergistic in NRAS Mutant Cell Lines.. We investigated whether the inhibitory effect seen was additive or synergistic. Different ratios for combinations of the MEKi+PI3K/mTORi 1,2 were assayed for synergism. NRAS mutant cell lines were synergistically inhibited with several different ratios [combination index (CI) <0.7], but all cell lines were synergistically inhibited by a molar ratio of MEKi:PI3K/mTORi 1,2 = 1:16 (JTP-74057:GSK2126458) (Fig. S4 and Table S5). When we used a different MEKi and PI3K/mTORi 1,2 such as PD325901 and BEZ235, we also found synergistic growth inhibition in MM485, MaMel30I, MaMel27II, WM3060, and WM1366 cells and additive effects in all remaining cell lines. However, these inhibitors required higher total concentrations for equipotent growth inhibition in all cells tested. Tables S3 and S4 display CI values for all human NRAS mutant cell lines treated with two different MEKi and two PI3K/mTORi 1,2, including the dose reduction index, which indicates how much the dose of each drug in a synergistic combination may be reduced at a given effect level, compared with the doses of each drug alone (17). We further found that the combination of the MEKi with the selective PI3Ki was synergistic in MaMel30I, MM485, MM415, WM1366, and WM3629 cells. Selective MEKi+ mTORi 1,2 was synergistic in MM485, MM415, and WM3629 cells.  Human Kinome Analysis of NRAS Mutant Cell Lines Reveals That Metabolic and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Pathways Are the Most Affected by the Combination Treatment.. Since protein kinases play a major role in signaling networks controlling cell growth, we investigated kinases that are mostly affected by the synergistic combination of MEKi+PI3K/mTORi 1,2. D04 and MaMel30I cells were exposed to vehicle (control), the MEKi, the PI3K/mTORi 1,2, or the combination of both drugs for 12 h. Total RNA was extracted and processed for the TaqMan OpenArray Human Kinome Panel. A total of 828 kinases and kinase-related genes were assessed with 126 probes for the cell line D04 (15.2% of total assays on the Kinome Array chip) and with 102 probes for the cell line MaMel30I (12.3% of total assays on the Kinome Array chip) displaying an at least twofold change in expression compared with the vehicle control (Dataset S1). The number of genes that showed a greater than twofold change confirmed that the effect of the combination treatment on gene expression in D04 and MaMel30I cells was greater than with the MEKi or PI3K/mTORi 1,2 alone (Fig. 7). We found that proteins involved in receptor signaling pathways, such as EGF-, VGF-, PDGF-, and FGF-signaling pathways and metabolic pathways such as the insulin-signaling cascade, were the most affected by the combination (Fig. S7). As an example, we noted down-regulation from PFKFB4, a gene that acts to fine-tune the process by which cells convert glucose into energy. The combination also affected genes involved in cell division such as DBF4, CDC7, MAP2K6, FLT1, and NME1, supporting the substantial decrease in cyclin D1 seen by MEKi+PI3KimTORi 12 (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the combination caused the up-regulation of tumor suppressor genes such as RB1CC1 and STK11 and proapoptosis genes such as CABC1, MAP3K10, DAPK3, and MAP3K9 (Fig. S8). Discussion. About 18?20% of all melanomas harbor oncogenic mutations in the NRAS gene, resulting in its inability to hydrolyze GTP (18, 19). The accumulation of active, GTP-bound NRAS leads to anchorage-independent signaling through several downstream cascades critical for cell proliferation, migration, and survival, thus contributing to the malignant phenotype of NRAS mutant melanoma (18, 20). The MEK/ERK and the PI3K/mTOR cascade are prototypic survival pathways that have been implicated in tumorogenesis of NRAS mutant melanoma (9, 21). Emerging preclinical evidence suggests that combined targeting of these two pathways with selective small-molecule inhibitors might be effective in treating malignancies with preexistent or acquired RAS mutations (22?25). In this study, we demonstrate that MEKi combined with PI3K/mTOR 1,2 inhibition is able to synergistically reduce cell viability in vitro and decrease tumor size in vivo in a large panel of human NRAS mutant melanoma cells. It has recently been demonstrated that cotargeting of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways with MEKi+AKTi and MEKi+mTORi 1 is effective in BRAF mutant cells with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors due to activating mutations in NRAS (26, 27). Although these combinations also decreased cell growth in our panel of 10 human NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines, we observed that it was less effective in decreasing cell viability than MEKi+PI3K/mTORi 1,2. Another study showed in vitro growth inhibition of GNAQ/GNA11 mutant cells with the combination of MEKi+PI3K/mTORi 1,2. Although these cells share partial similarities in their phosphorylation cascade with NRAS cell lines, distinct differences in their signaling cascade are evident. Most importantly, loss of mutant GNAQ or GNA11 has no significant effect on p-AKT levels. In contrast, NRAS mutant melanoma cells signal strongly through AKT, pointing to the fact that, although different cell lineages may share sensitivity to therapeutics, differences in the signaling network and in vivo response might be found (9, 16). Other studies based on data derived from mouse melanocytes from an inducible NRAS transgenic mouse model identified CDK4 as a coextinction target with MEK (28). We treated our panel of 10 human NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines with a MEKi, CDK4/6i, or the combination of both at different concentrations and ratios. In our hands, the observed effect with the combination treatment was antagonistic in all cell lines at a ratio of MEKi:CDKi 4,6 = 1:16. When different ratios were used in cell line MM415, no significant difference was noted between the MEKi alone and the combination of MEKi+CDKi 4,6 (Fig. S9). However, these results need to be interpreted with caution as other ratios and concentrations could still be synergistic. We also did not test MEKi+CDKi 4,6 in vivo. This study uses a very large set of human NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines, demonstrating in vitro and in vivo, that combined targeting of MEK and PI3K/mTOR 1,2 inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis leading to tumor size reduction. In our first set of experiments, we evaluated the expression of phosphorylated effector proteins in the MEK/ERK and the PI3K/mTOR pathway in primary and metastatic NRAS mutant melanomas of 32 different patients by IHC. We found that over 95% of the samples expressed phosphorylated effector proteins in either the MEK/ERK or the PI3K/mTOR pathway, adding evidence to previous studies that found that these pathways are active in NRAS mutant melanoma (9, 29). Over half of the slides showed expression of phosphoproteins in both pathways. Staining intensity was significantly higher for the MEK/ERK than for the PI3K/mTOR pathway (MEK/ERK 1.2 \u00a1\u00be 0.2 PI3K/mTOR 0.86 \u00a1\u00be 0.3 P = 0.015), suggesting a predominance of this pathway in NRAS mutant melanomas stained. Recent studies demonstrate that cells with activating mutations in the RAS pathway respond to MEK inhibitors; however, in melanoma, this is especially true for RAF mutant tumors with no other activating alternations (12, 30, 31). To test whether NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines are sensitive to MEK inhibition, we characterized their response to two different MEK inhibitors. Treatment reduced cell growth in all cell lines, but only D04 cells were particularly sensitive to MEK inhibition (Fig. 2 and Tables S3 and S4). This is in agreement with findings from other groups and might be explained by the recruitment of additional prosurvival downstream effector pathways by mutant NRAS such as the PI3K/mTOR pathway (29, 30, 32, 33). Indeed, previous studies found that binding of RAS to PI3Kp100\u00a5\u00e1 is required for RAS-driven tumorigenesis and that mTOR 2 is essential for transformation as well as for the vitality of melanoma cells (32, 34). However, targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway in isolation only moderately reduced cell viability with PI3K/mTOR 1,2 inhibitors being the most potent. In this study, dual pathway activation and cross talk are supported by IHC results from patient specimens and immunoblot analyses that show dose-dependent induction of p-AKT in response to MEKi and induction of p-ERK by a PI3K/mTORi 1,2 (Figs. 1 and ?and2).2). This suggests that activation of the MEK/ERK and the PI3K/mTOR pathways by mutant NRAS confers relative resistance to drugs targeting one pathway in isolation (29, 35, 36). Combining a MEKi with inhibitors of PI3K, mTOR complexes, or AKT provides additional inhibitory activity compared with MEKi alone. Residual protein levels of p-ERK, p-AKT, and p-S6 show incomplete inhibition, which might explain cell survival (37, 38). In contrast, MEKi+PI3K/mTORi 1,2 revealed complete suppression of p-ERK, p-AKT, and p-S6 levels in most cell lines and was most potent in reducing cell viability in all cell lines tested in this study (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we demonstrate tumor size reduction in vivo with five different human NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines. Targets that might account for the synergistic effect were assessed by kinome expression profiling, which revealed that MEKi+PI3K/mTORi 1,2 affected proteins involved in metabolic and receptor signaling pathways as well as proapoptotic and tumor suppressor proteins (Fig. 7). Our study offers a unique comparative insight into the differences among the effect of various single and combined inhibitors of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR cascades. Taking together the preclinical data presented in this work, MEKi+PI3K/mTORi 1,2 is the most effective combination to inhibit NRAS mutant melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo and might serve as a therapeutic option in the treatment of NRAS mutant melanoma, for which there are currently no effective therapies.

                "text": "Elucidating distinct roles for NF1 in melanomagenesis\tBRAF mutations play a well-established role in melanomagenesis; however, without additional genetic alterations tumor development is restricted by oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Here we show that mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cooperate with BRAF mutations in melanomagenesis by preventing OIS. In a genetically engineered mouse model, Nf1 mutations suppress Braf-induced senescence, promote melanocyte hyperproliferation, and enhance melanoma development. Nf1 mutations function by deregulating both PI3K and ERK pathways. As such, Nf1/Braf mutant tumors are resistant to BRAF inhibitors but are sensitive to combined MEK/mTOR inhibition. Importantly, NF1 is mutated or suppressed in human melanomas that harbor concurrent BRAF mutations, NF1 ablation decreases the sensitivity of melanoma cell lines to BRAF inhibitors, and NF1 is lost in tumors from patients following treatment with these agents. Collectively, these studies provide mechanistic insight into how NF1 cooperates with BRAF mutations in melanoma and demonstrate that NF1-inactivation may impact responses to targeted therapies. INTRODUCTION. Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is an irreversible growth arrest that is triggered by a variety of oncogenic signals (1). This form of senescence functions as a protective response to aberrant cell signaling and has been shown to restrict the progression of benign lesions such as melanocytic nevi, lung adenomas, neurofibromas, and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (2). Several mechanisms have been proposed to underlie OIS including excessive DNA damage (3?5), heterochromatin formation (6), negative feedback pathways (7, 8), and chemokine signaling (8?10). Notably, these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and it is likely that they cooperate to establish a senescence response in different tissues. OIS has been shown to be important for restricting melanoma development in response to activating BRAF mutations (11, 12). BRAF is mutated in 50?70% of human melanomas (reviewed in (13)). The most frequent BRAF mutation (BRAF V600E) results in a constitutively active kinase. Analysis of human lesions and mouse models has demonstrated that BRAF V600E mutations drive the development of benign nevi (14?16). However in the absence of additional mutations melanocytes within these nevi ultimately become senescent and do not progress to malignancy (11, 12, 15). Notably, a subset of genetic alterations found in human melanoma prevent BRAF-induced senescence, underscoring the importance of OIS as a mechanism of tumor suppression (15, 17). Nevertheless we still do not have a complete mechanistic or genetic understanding of how OIS is bypassed in melanoma or more generally in cancer. We have previously shown that oncogenic RAF triggers a potent negative feedback signaling network that suppresses RAS and that this feedback loop plays an important role in OIS in vitro (7). Specifically, in response to constitutively activated RAF and MEK proteins, RAS becomes suppressed due to the upregulation of several direct negative RAS regulatory proteins and the concomitant inactivation of positive RAS regulators (7). Moreover RAF-induced RAS suppression substantially attenuates PI3K/AKT signaling, which contributes to OIS in this setting (7). These observations raise the intriguing possibility that mutational events that promote RAS activation might play an important role in preventing RAF-induced senescence. If so, then mutations in such genes might be expected to cooperate with BRAF mutations in human cancer. The NF1 tumor suppressor gene encodes a RAS GTPase Activating Protein (RAS GAP) neurofibromin, which negatively regulates RAS by catalyzing the hydrolysis of RAS-GTP to RAS-GDP (18). Accordingly, RAS and downstream effector pathways are aberrantly activated in NF1-deficient tumors (18?20). NF1 is mutated in the familial cancer syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 and has more recently been shown to be mutated or suppressed by proteasomal mechanisms in glioblastoma, lung cancer, and neuroblastoma (21?25); however, the full extent that NF1 loss may play in sporadic tumorigenesis is unknown. Because of its direct effects on RAS and known involvement in melanocyte biology, we investigated a potential role for NF1 in melanomagenesis. Our studies reveal distinct mechanisms by which NF1 mutations cooperate with different BRAF mutations in melanomas. Moreover, we have found that NF1-loss affects the therapeutic response to BRAF inhibitors. RESULTS. Nf1 mutations rescue the inhibitory effects of constitutively activated RAF. We previously showed that oncogenic RAF alleles potently suppress RAS and subsequent PI3K/AKT signaling and that this suppression is important for OIS in some settings (Fig. 1A) (7). Because NF1 encodes a direct negative regulator of RAS we reasoned that the effects of this feedback response might be counteracted by ablating NF1 expression. Wild-type and Nf1 ?/? mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were stably infected with a hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT) inducible, activated RAF construct (26). 4-OHT substantially suppressed RAS-GTP levels in wild-type cells, consistent with previous findings (Fig. 1B?C) (7). However, RAF activation had minimal suppressive effects on RAS activity in Nf1 ?/? cells (Fig. 1B?C). Similar effects were also observed in cells in which Nf1 expression was acutely ablated by shRNA sequences (Supplementary Fig. 1). Shortly thereafter AKT phosphorylation became substantially reduced in Nf1 wild-type cells at both Ser 473 and Thr 308 (Fig. 1D?E), however Nf1-deficiency significantly ameliorated this suppression (Fig. 1D?E). It should be noted that even in the absence of Nf1, RAF partially inhibited AKT phosphorylation, consistent with the known involvement of several redundant negative feedback signals (7). Notably, Nf1-loss caused a baseline activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, as previously observed (Fig. 1D?E) (19, 20), and therefore minimized the net suppressive effects on AKT. Most importantly however, RAF activation exerted differential effects on proliferation in wild-type and Nf1-mutant cells. Consistent with previous observations oncogenic RAF caused a potent and irreversible growth arrest in Nf1 wild-type MEFs (Fig. 1F) (27, 28). However, RAF activation did not suppress the proliferation of Nf1-deficient cells (Fig. 1G), demonstrating that RAS suppression is a critical mediator of this inhibitory response. Compound mutations in Nf1 and BRaf promote melanocyte hyperproliferation in vivo. To investigate the potential cooperativity of NF1 and RAF mutations in a relevant tumorigenic setting we generated a mouse model to evaluate the effects of Nf1-loss in the presence of activating Braf mutations. As noted previously BRAF is mutated in 50?70% of human melanomas (13). Based on our in vitro findings and the fact that neurofibromin plays a well-established role in melanocytes (29), we evaluated the potential cooperativity of Braf and Nf1 mutations in the context of melanomagenesis. Mice carrying a conditional inactivating mutation in Nf1 (Nf1 flox/flox mice) (30) were crossed to mice with a conditional activating mutation in Braf (Braf CA/+ mice) (31). These animals were then crossed to a transgenic mouse strain harboring a tamoxifen (TM)-inducible Cre recombinase-estrogen receptor fusion transgene that is under the control of the melanocyte-specific tyrosinase promoter, designated Tyr::CreER T2 (32). Activation of CreER by TM in Tyr::CreER; Braf CA/+; Nf1 flox/flox mice leads to melanocyte specific conversion of Braf CA to Braf V600E and the conversion of the Nf1 flox alleles to Nf1 null alleles. Six genetic cohorts of animals were generated to evaluate the effects of Braf activation in the presence and absence of Nf1. Mice were treated topically with TM 2?3 months after birth as previously described (15). After 4?5 weeks significant darkening of the tails, ears, eyelids, perianal regions, and paws was observed in the Tyr::CreER; Braf CA/+; Nf1 flox/flox mice as compared to all other genotypes (Fig. 2A?B). While Tyr::CreER; Braf CA/+ animals exhibited subtle hyperpigmentation, the skin hyperpigmentation in the Tyr::CreER; Braf CA/+; Nf1 flox/flox mice became dramatically more pronounced over time and was concurrent with visible thickening of the respective tissues (Fig. 2A?B). The histopathological features of these lesions were consistent with expansion of the dermis, the skin layer where murine melanocytes reside, and massive melanin deposition (Fig. 2C). An increased number of cells expressing the melanocyte marker S100 was observed, confirming excessive melanocyte hyperproliferation in Tyr::CreER; Braf CA/+; Nf1 flox/flox mice as compared to the Braf CA/+ genotype (Fig. 2C). Importantly we found that deep dermal lesions derived from control Tyr::CreER; Braf CA/+ mice stained positive for senescence-associated (SA)-\u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase (Fig. 2D, top panels), as has been shown in human nevi (12) and in lesions within the Braf V600E-driven mouse model described by Dhomen et al. 2009 (15). However, senescence was not observed in Tyr::CreER; Braf CA/+; Nf1 flox/flox mice (Fig. 2D, bottom panels). These results are consistent with our cellular studies and indicate that mutations in Nf1 prevent Braf-induced senescence of melanocytes in mice, thereby rescuing the proliferative restriction and triggering excessive proliferation. PI3K is a well-known effector of RAS (33). We and others have previously shown that NF1 loss triggers the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway through RAS (19, 20, 34). Moreover, Nf1 mutations minimize the suppressive effects of Braf mutations on this pathway (Fig. 1D?E). Notably, we found that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 prevented the melanocytic hyperplasia in Tyr::CreER; Braf CA/+; Nf1 flox/flox mice (Fig. 2E), demonstrating that Nf1 loss was mediating its effects in melanocytes, in part, by permitting/enhancing the activation of this pathway. Nf1 and BRaf mutations cooperate to promote melanomas in mice. If OIS does in fact restrict tumor development then Nf1/Braf mutant mice would be expected to be more prone to developing melanomas. It has been previously reported that a subset of Braf V600E mice develop melanomas, presumably due to the stochastic acquisition of additional genetic alterations (15). Consistent with this observation 22% (6/27) of the Braf V600E mice in our cohort developed melanomas; however, 57% (16/28) of the Tyr::CreER; Braf CA/+; Nf1 flox/flox mice developed melanomas (p=0.008, Chi Square test) (Fig. 3A?E). One Braf/Nf1 mutant mouse developed two melanomas, which was never observed in Braf mutant animals, however melanomas from both genotypes grew at similar rates. These observations support the hypothesis that Nf1 loss prevents Braf-induced senescence in vivo and therefore plays a role early in tumor development rather than in progression. However effects on metastasis could not be evaluated in this model, as animals from both genotypes needed to be euthanized due to primary tumor size. While pigmented melanocytes were occasionally observed on the exterior these melanomas were typically hypopigmented (Fig. 3B). All Braf/Nf1 tumors displayed histological and cytological features typical of malignant melanomas. Tumors were highly cellular with most showing a fascicular growth pattern (Fig. 3C). The degree of pleomorphism was variable. The majority of the tumor cells were amelanotic, however many tumors showed occasional clusters of pigmented cells and pigment containing macrophages (melanophages) (Fig. 3C, right). All tumors involved the dermis as well as subcutaneous soft tissue and ulceration of the tumor surface was seen in the majority of cases. Tumors expressed both S100 (Fig. 3D) and MITF (Fig. 3E), two markers typically used to diagnose human melanomas. Melanomas from both genotypes were further evaluated by immunoblot (Fig. 3F). One tumor that developed in Tyr::CreER; Braf CA/+; Nf1 flox/flox mice did not efficiently excise Nf1. However in general higher levels of phospho-AKT were typically observed in Braf/Nf1 mutant versus Braf mutant tumors (Fig. 3F?G), consistent with the observation that Nf1 mutations enhance PI3K/AKT activation and contribute to tumorigenesis, in part, via this pathway (19, 20, 34) (Fig. 2E). Nf1 mutations desensitize melanomas to BRAF inhibitors. The mutant BRAF selective inhibitor PLX4032 (vemurafenib, Plexxikon/Roche) promotes the regression of human melanomas that harbor activating BRAF mutations and has been approved for treating human melanomas (35). To investigate the sensitivity of melanomas harboring compound mutations in Braf and Nf1 to BRAF inhibitors and other targeted agents, we first isolated cells from Braf and Braf/Nf1 mutant tumors. As expected, cells from two independently derived Braf mutant melanomas were sensitive to the PLX4032 analogue, PLX4720 (Fig. 4A). However, cells from Braf/Nf1 mutant tumors were insensitive to this agent (Fig. 4A, IC50>10\u00a5\u00ecM). Biochemical studies confirmed that increasing concentrations of PLX4720 effectively suppressed phospho-ERK levels in Braf mutant cells (Fig. 4B). Notably, however, phospho-ERK was not as effectively suppressed in Braf/Nf1 mutant cells (Fig. 4B). Next we evaluated sensitivity to these agents in vivo. While allografts from several independent Braf/Nf1 mutant melanomas were readily established, cells from BRaf mutant mouse melanomas never successfully grew as allografts. As such we focused on using Braf/Nf1 allografts to determine whether we could identify a more effective therapy for these genetically distinct tumors. Two weeks after injection, when tumors were growing in log phase, mice were randomly divided into different treatment groups. Similar to our in vitro analysis, Braf/Nf1 mutant melanomas were relatively insensitive to PLX4720 (Fig. 4C, red) and phospho-ERK was not efficiently inhibited in tumors in vivo (Fig. 4D). This finding is consistent with the observation that induction of tumor regression by PLX4032 requires almost complete suppression of ERK signaling (36). In contrast, these tumors were more sensitive to the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (Fig. 4C, blue), which effectively suppressed phospho-ERK in vivo (Fig. 4D). Together with our in vitro studies this insensitivity suggests that neurofibromin loss may enhance ERK activity via a BRAF-independent mechanism, which will be discussed further below. Because our in vivo experiments demonstrated that melanocyte hyperproliferation in Tyr::CreER; Braf CA/+; Nf1 flox/flox mice could be rescued by the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941, we evaluated the effects of GDC-0941 on tumor growth, and found that it had a slight growth suppressive effect on these melanomas (Fig. 4C, green). However given that mTOR has been shown to be an important effector in NF1 mutant tumors we also assessed the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (20, 34, 37). Rapamycin had a more pronounced effect as compared to GDC-0941, but more importantly it synergized with PD0325901 to promote tumor regression (Fig. 4C, purple). In contrast, rapamycin did not promote tumor regression when combined with PLX4720 (Fig. 4C, violet). Taken together these results suggest that Nf1 mutations can desensitize Braf mutant melanomas to PLX4720. Based on the biochemical function of neurofibromin and the preclinical data presented here, therapies aimed at targeting both MEK and mTOR may represent an alternative therapeutic approach for Braf/Nf1 mutant tumors. NF1 is suppressed and/or mutated in human melanoma. Given these compelling mouse phenotypes we next investigated whether NF1 is lost or mutated in human melanomas. Like p53, neurofibromin can be inactivated by both genetic and proteasomal mechanisms (23). We first evaluated neurofibromin expression in a panel of melanoma cell lines. Four out of eleven cell lines exhibited little or no neurofibromin expression (Fig. 5A). Sequence analysis confirmed that three of these cell lines harbored loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 gene (Supplementary Table 1). It should be noted that two of the NF1 alterations (p.K1290K in A375 cells and p.K2307K in WM3670 cells) abolish splice donor sites (c.3870G>A and c.6921G>A, respectively), result in defective splicing and disrupt the NF1 transcript. Sequence analysis of the cDNA of NF1 enabled the detection of these aberrant splicing events, however, both NF1 mutations may have been categorized as \u00a1\u00aenon-deleterious\u00a1\u00af silent alterations using exome sequencing approaches. We then mined publically available databases and identified numerous additional NF1 mutations in human cell lines (Supplementary Table 1). Analysis of primary melanomas also confirmed the presence of somatic NF1 mutations (Supplementary Table 2). In many, but not in all cases, BRAF mutations were also present. These findings suggest that while NF1 mutations can cooperate with activating BRAF mutations, they may also play a broader role in melanomagenesis. Interestingly, however, while we expected to find coincidental mutations with BRAF V600E, we also observed NF1 mutations in cells that harbored inactivating BRAF mutations (Supplementary Table 1), a point which will be discussed below. To complement the mouse modeling studies and confirm a functional role for NF1 inactivation in human melanomas we reconstituted neurofibromin in A375 cells, which harbor compound NF1 and BRAF V600E mutations. Full-length neurofibromin expression potently suppressed the growth of xenografts in mice (p=3.246E-004, Mann Whitney U test), consistent with the notion that NF1-inactivation plays a causal role in tumor development (Fig. 5B). As noted above, the NF1 tumor suppressor is frequently inactivated by proteasomal mechanisms in human cancer (23). As such mutational analysis may underestimate the frequency of NF1/neurofibromin loss in tumors. Therefore we performed immunohistochemical analysis on human melanoma tumor arrays. No visible neurofibromin expression was observed in 15% (6/39) of melanomas and 18% (6/34) of the metastatic melanomas (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Table 3). It should be noted that only a complete absence of staining was scored as negative in this analysis. Therefore excessive but incomplete neurofibromin destruction was not considered, but could still play a role in tumor development. NF1 loss and BRAF inhibitors in human tumors. Preclinical studies in mouse tumors suggested that Nf1 loss can desensitize Braf mutant melanomas to BRAF inhibitors. To evaluate this possibility in human tumors we genetically ablated neurofibromin expression with lentivrial shRNA sequences in human melanoma cell lines and found that NF1 suppression decreased the sensitivity of WM3526 cells to PLX4720 by 11-fold (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. 2). As noted previously A375 cells harbor a loss of function NF1 mutation and express very low levels of neurofibromin. Because these cells remain somewhat sensitive to BRAF inhibitors we further reduced neurofibromin expression with shRNA sequences and found that NF1 suppression also decreased the sensitivity of these cells to BRAF inhibitors (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. 2). It should be noted that while the acute ablation of NF1 in established melanoma cell lines desensitized these cells to PLX4720, tumors that naturally developed in the absence of Nf1 were much more resistant to this agent. We hypothesize that this difference may reflect inherent differences in pre-existing signaling networks and/or cooperating mutations in these established tumor cells, which did not evolve in the absence of NF1. Nevertheless, consistent with observations in mouse tumors, PLX4720 was much less effective at suppressing phospho-ERK in cells in which NF1 was ablated, indicating that NF1 loss was promoting BRAF-independent ERK signaling in these tumor cells as well (Fig. 6C). Finally, we were able to obtain frozen tissue from 5 sets of pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies from patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) or combined BRAF and MEK inhibitor (dabrafenib + trametinib). Notably, 2 out of 5 tumors expressed very little or no neurofibromin prior to treatment, consistent with observation that NF1/neurofibromin is lost or suppressed in human melanomas at a relatively frequent rate (Fig. 6D). However in 2 of the remaining 3 tumors where neurofibromin was robustly expressed prior to treatment, neurofibromin was no longer expressed in tumors following treatment (Fig. 6D). Taken together with preclinical studies in the mouse model and genetic studies in human melanoma cell lines, these observations further support the hypothesis that NF1/neurofibromin suppression may play an important role in mediating resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Notably, in glioblastoma neurofibromin appears to be more frequently lost by proteasomal mechanisms (23). Therefore future studies aimed at assessing NF1/neurofibromin loss in response to therapies will likely require analysis of both protein expression and genetic alterations. NF1 mutations cooperate with BRAF mutations by activating both K- and HRAS. Our central hypothesis is that loss of NF1 alleviates the suppression of RAS imposed by activated BRAF. To identify the RAS isoforms that are critically regulated by neurofibromin in melanomas we performed both gain- and loss-of-function studies. In melanoma cells that retain neurofibromin expression RNAi-mediated suppression of neurofibromin resulted in the activation of H- and KRAS, but not NRAS (Fig. 7A). Conversely, reconstituting melanoma cell lines with an active neurofibromin fragment suppressed H- and KRAS activity but not NRAS activity (Fig. 7B). Finally shRNA-mediated suppression of either H- or KRAS suppressed the ability of NF1-deficient melanoma cells harboring an active BRAF mutation to proliferate and form colonies in soft agar, whereas NRAS-specific shRNA sequences had no effect (Fig. 7C?E). These results suggest that neurofibromin loss/suppression activates H- and KRAS in melanomas and that both of these isoforms are critical for the tumorigenicity of these cancer cells. As shown in Supplementary Table 1, NF1 mutations were also detected in cells that harbored inactivating BRAF mutations. While the kinase activity of these BRAF proteins is compromised, they have been proposed to function as scaffolds that translocate CRAF to the membrane and promote CRAF activation downstream of KRAS (38). Notably, the oncogenic effects of these mutants are significantly enhanced in the presence of KRAS G12D (38). Similarly, an NF1 mutation might be expected to function as an alternative mechanism of activating KRAS, and also potentiate the effects of these BRAF mutants. To evaluate the contribution of RAS isoforms in human melanomas we examined WM3629 cells. Interestingly, in addition to harboring the kinase-dead BRAF D594G mutation and an NF1 deletion, this cell line also possesses an activating NRAS G12D mutation (39, 40). The WM3670 line similarly harbors an inactivating BRAF mutation, as well as NF1 and NRAS G12D mutations (39, 40). Consistent with the presence of these mutations and our previous observations, NRAS, KRAS, and HRAS are all activated in WM3629 cells. Moreover, shRNA-mediated ablation of all three RAS isoforms, H-, K-, and NRAS, suppressed the ability of WM3629 cells to proliferate and form colonies in soft agar (Fig. 7F?H). These results further demonstrate that neurofibromin critically regulates H- and KRAS in melanomas and suggest that in the presence of NRAS mutations all three RAS isoforms cooperate with inactivating BRAF mutations to promote tumorigenesis. DISCUSSION. This study establishes several distinct roles for NF1 in melanomagenesis. First, our data suggest that in the presence of activating Braf mutations, Nf1-loss prevents Braf-induced senescence of melanocytes. In mice, this results in excessive melanocyte hyperproliferation and ultimately enhances melanoma development. Importantly, NF1 mutations co-occur with activating BRAF mutations in human melanomas and neurofibromin reconstitution potently suppresses the growth of human melanoma cells as xenografts, further supporting a causal role for NF1 loss in melanomagenesis. However, we have found that NF1 mutations can also cooperate with inactivating BRAF mutations in melanomas. While these BRAF mutations are less common, in this setting we found that NF1 mutations co-occur with NRAS mutations and that all three RAS isoforms are required for the tumorigenic properties of these cells. Thus, NF1 mutations can contribute to melanoma development in at least two genetic settings via distinct mechanisms. We also found that in the context of activating BRAF alleles NF1 mutations contribute to tumorigenesis, in part, by promoting the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Notably, the PTEN tumor suppressor is commonly mutated or lost in human melanomas (41). Mouse modeling studies and human tumor analysis suggest that BRAF and PTEN mutations cooperate in melanomagenesis (14). More recently, PTEN loss has been shown to prevent BRAF-induced senescence in mice and in human melanocytes, further supporting the notion that co-activation of these pathways is important for preventing OIS (17). Our data demonstrate that NF1 loss is another important mechanism by which the PI3K pathway can become inactivated in melanomas. It should be noted however, that NF1 and PTEN mutations do not appear to be mutually exclusive in melanomas. Moreover, we have found that NF1 loss also results in the activation of multiple RAS isoforms and potentiates ERK activation independent from activating BRAF mutations. Taken together these observations suggest that NF1 loss contributes to melanomagenesis by enhancing the activation of both PI3K and ERK signaling, which may be important in the context of selecting effective therapies (Model presented in Fig. 7I). Several mechanisms have been reported to mediate the resistance of BRAF mutant melanomas to BRAF inhibitors (42?46). Additional mechanisms are likely to be discovered and currently one prevalent mechanism of resistance has not emerged. We have shown that Nf1 mutations confer resistance to PLX4720 in Braf-mutant mouse melanomas, however these tumors are sensitive to combined MEK/mTOR inhibitors. Importantly, RNAi-mediated NF1 suppression also decreases the sensitivity of human melanoma cell lines to BRAF inhibitors and most notably NF1/neurofibromin is lost in a subset of relapsing and residual tumors from patients exposed to BRAF inhibitors. The observation that NF1 is also mutated or lost in some naive primary tumors is consistent with the hypothesis that NF1-inactivation may contribute to both de novo and acquired resistance. However, while NF1 mutations can be detected in human melanomas, the true frequency of NF1-loss may be difficult to assess, because like PTEN and P53, the NF1 protein is frequently inactivated by proteasomal destruction (23). Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor microarrays indicates that neurofibromin expression is completely absent in 15?18% of melanomas, however a more quantitative evaluation of protein levels may be required to accurately evaluate its expression/suppression before and after drug treatment. To date, much of the resistance to BRAF inhibitors appears to be driven by events that activate ERK through mechanisms that circumvent or decrease dependency on BRAF. However, aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has also been implicated in resistance to BRAF inhibitors (46?48). In this respect NF1 (loss) is uniquely poised, as it activates the ERK pathway through its effects on KRAS and HRAS and at the same time enhances PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. METHODS. Cell Culture Techniques, Infections and Proliferation Curves. Wild-type and NF1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated as described (49). Cells were stably infected with a pBabe retroviral vector containing the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT) inducible estrogen receptor RAF-1 (\u00a5\u00c4RAF:ER) construct (28). This construct is an estrogen receptor-RAF-1 fusion molecule, and contains the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor fused to the activated RAF kinase domain of RAF-1. Cells were split to an equal density 16hr prior to harvesting in DMEM medium containing 1% fetal calf serum (FCS) and different concentrations of 4-OHT (0, 5, 50 or 500nM). For proliferation studies, cells were counted at seeded at a density of 25 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 in a 12-well format in DMEM medium containing 10% FCS and different concentrations of 4-OHT (0, 5, 50nM). Cells were counted the day after plating and every other day after until uninduced cells reached confluency. Media containing fresh 4-OHT was changed every 48hrs. The melanoma cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and the Garraway lab (46). No additional authentication was done by the authors. All melanoma cell lines were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin and streptomycin. For dose-response curves, cells were seeded in triplicate in a 6-well format. Cells were counted the day after plating when PLX4720 (Calbiochem) was added as well as after 3 days when DMSO treated cells reached confluency. To allow comparison of IC50\u00a1\u00afs between cell lines growth inhibition was calculated at 5 population doublings for every cell line. Neurofibromin activity was reconstituted using the previously described NF1-GAP related domain (GRD) construct (20) or an expression vector containing full length NF1 cDNA. Neurofibromin expression was abolished using short hairpin RNA\u00a1\u00afs specific to NF1 (20). Preparation of Protein Lysates and Western Blotting. RAS-GTP levels were detected using a RAS activation assay, following the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions (EMD Millipore). Tumor lysates were homogenized and extracted with boiling 1% SDS buffer. Resulting protein lysates were quantified and run according to validated immunoblot procedures with the following antibodies: phospho-AKT (Ser473, #4060, Cell Signaling), phospho-AKT (Thr308, #9275, Cell Signaling), AKT (#9272, Cell Signaling), phospho-ERK (Thr202/Thr204, #4370, Cell Signaling), ERK (#9102, Cell Signaling), phospho-S6 (Ser235/236, #2211, Cell Signaling), S6 (#2317, Cell Signaling), NF1 (#A300-140A, Bethyl Laboratories), p120 (#{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"G12920\",\"term_id\":\"1113533\",\"term_text\":\"G12920\"}}G12920, Trans Labs), RAS (#05-516, Upstate), KRAS (#sc-30, Santa Cruz), HRAS (sc-520, Santa Cruz), NRAS (#sc-519, Santa Cruz) and MITF (#M3621, Dako). Immunoblots were quantified with Image J software. Experimental Animals. Animal procedures were approved by the Center for Animal and Comparative Medicine in Harvard Medical School in accordance with the NIH Guild for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Animal Welfare Act. A breeding scheme was set up where mice carrying a conditional Nf1 allele (Nf1 flox/flox mice) (30) were crossed to mice with a conditional activating mutation in Braf (Braf CA/+ mice) (31) and a transgenic mouse strain harboring a tamoxifen (TM)-inducible Cre recombinase-estrogen receptor fusion transgene that is under the control of the melanocyte-specific tyrosinase promoter, designated Tyr::CreER T2 (32). Genotyping was performed by PCR as described for every model (30?32). To activate Tyr::CreER mice were treated topically with freshly prepared tamoxifen (T5648, Sigma) 2?3 months after birth. Tamoxifen (20mg/ml in 100% ethanol) was applied to a small section of skin on the shaven backs and the treatment schedule consisted of 4 treatments over 7 days. For all genotypes pigmentation levels were quantified weekly on a scale from 0 (no pigmentation) to 8 (high pigmentation). To study the contribution of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the observed hyperpigmentation phenotype in the Tyr::CreER; Braf CA/+; Nf1 flox/flox mice, animals were treated daily with the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (150mg/kg, oral gavage) for 8 weeks after Tyr::CreER induction. Xenograft Studies and Treatments. For cancer cell xenograft experiments nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 3 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 human or mouse melanoma cells. Tumor volumes were calculated by measuring length and width of the lesions and with the formula [(length) \u00a1\u00bf (width) 2 \u00a1\u00bf 0.52]. Murine Nf1/Braf mutant melanoma cells formed rapidly growing tumors. Two weeks after injection, when tumors were growing in log phase, mice were randomly divided into different treatment groups that were administered either the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (150mg/kg, oral gavage (OG)), the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (5mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection (IP)), the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (10mg/kg, OG), the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 (2.5mg/kg, IP) or the combination of both PD0325901 or PLX4720 and rapamycin. Mice were treated daily for 7 days. Histology, Immunohistochemistry and SA-\u00a5\u00e2-gal staining. Tissues were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) where indicated. Standard immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence protocols were followed for S100 (Z0311, Dako, 1:400) staining. An alkaline phosphatase staining method was used for NF1 (ab30325, Abcam, 1:300) immunohistochemistry. Antigen unmasking was performed by pressure cooking in citrate buffer (pH6). A human melanoma tissue micorarray (ME804a, US Biomax Inc) was used for evaluation of NF1 expression in malignant and metastatic melanomas. Senescence associated (SA)-\u00a5\u00e2-gal staining was performed on fresh mouse tissue. Small pieces were fixed for 30 min in 3% paraformaldehyde, incubated in SA-\u00a5\u00e2-gal staining solution as described (50), and then embedded and sectioned. NF1 Mutational analysis and Data mining. The entire NF1 coding region of 11 human melanoma cell lines (Fig. 5A) was amplified in 5 overlapping RT-PCR fragments and used as the template for direct sequencing, essentially as described (51). Copy number analysis by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was performed as described (52). The nomenclature of the mutations is based on NF1 mRNA sequence {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NM_001042492.2\",\"term_id\":\"270132520\",\"term_text\":\"NM_001042492.2\"}}NM_001042492.2, with 1 being the first nucleotide of the ATG start codon. Next, publicly available resources providing information on somatic mutations implicated in human melanoma cell lines (53, 54) and primary tumors (55?57) were mined. Patient Samples. Patients with metastatic melanoma containing BRAF V600E mutation (confirmed by genotyping) were enrolled on clinical trials for treatment with a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) or combined BRAF + MEK inhibitor (dabrafenib + trametinib) and were consented for tissue acquisition per IRB-approved protocol. Tumor biopsies were performed pre-treatment (day 0), at 10?14 days on treatment, and/or at time of progression if applicable. Formalin-fixed tissue was analyzed to confirm that viable tumor was present via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Additional tissue was snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen.

                "text": "A human tRNA methyltransferase 9-like protein prevents tumour growth by regulating LIN9 and HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1\tEmerging evidence points to aberrant regulation of translation as a driver of cell transformation in cancer. Given the direct control of translation by tRNA modifications, tRNA modifying enzymes may function as regulators of cancer progression. Here, we show that a tRNA methyltransferase 9-like (hTRM9L/KIAA1456) mRNA is down-regulated in breast, bladder, colorectal, cervix and testicular carcinomas. In the aggressive SW620 and HCT116 colon carcinoma cell lines, hTRM9L is silenced and its re-expression and methyltransferase activity dramatically suppressed tumour growth in vivo. This growth inhibition was linked to decreased proliferation, senescence-like G0/G1-arrest and up-regulation of the RB interacting protein LIN9. Additionally, SW620 cells re-expressing hTRM9L did not respond to hypoxia via HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1-dependent induction of GLUT1. Importantly, hTRM9L-negative tumours were highly sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics and this was associated with altered tRNA modification levels compared to antibiotic resistant hTRM9L-expressing SW620 cells. Our study links hTRM9L and tRNA modifications to inhibition of tumour growth via LIN9 and HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1-dependent mechanisms. It also suggests that aminoglycoside antibiotics may be useful to treat hTRM9L-deficient tumours. INTRODUCTION. The regulation of translation has primarily been studied at the level of initiation, with both CAP-dependent and CAP-independent regulatory mechanisms playing vital roles in cellular proliferation, stress signalling and cell cycle progression (Komar & Hatzoglou, 2011; Sonenberg & Hinnebusch, 2009; Sonenberg et al, 2000). Translation elongation is another regulatory strategy and, at its core, requires the efficient interaction of codons and anticodons found on mRNA and tRNA, respectively. Enzyme catalysed modification of tRNA has been shown to dramatically affect codon?anticodon interactions (Murphy et al, 2004; Yarian et al, 2002). Among the tRNA modifications in eukaryotes, wobble uridine modifications have been well studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with 11 of 13 tRNAs possessing either 5-carbamoylmethyluridine (ncm 5U), the 2\u00a1\u00c7-O-ribose-methylated form ncm 5Um, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm 5U) or 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm 5s 2U; Johansson et al, 2008). Wobble uridine and anticodon-associated modifications on tRNA molecules promote or restrict specific anticodon?codon interactions and can influence translation speed and fidelity. In fact, the levels of many modifications associated with the structure of the anticodon (positions 34 or 37) change in response to cellular stress, supporting that translation elongation is dynamically regulated (Chan et al, 2010). The completion of the wobble uridine modification mcm 5U (a precursor for mcm 5s 2U) is catalysed by yeast tRNA methyltransferase 9 (Trm9) and its mammalian homolog ALKBH8 (Begley et al, 2007; Fu et al, 2010a; Songe-Moller et al, 2010). Amino acid sequence analyses reveal one gene encoding Trm9 in S. cerevisiae (Trm9) and two Trm9 homologs in mammals (KIAA1456 and ALKBH8; Fig 1A). Trm9 has been biochemically characterized. After elongator complex proteins generate the substrate cm 5U, Trm9 uses the methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to complete the formation of mcm 5-based modifications. Trm9 forms a complex with Trm112 to catalyse the last step in the formation of mcm 5U (Mazauric et al, 2010). Clarke and coworkers initially characterized Trm9 and demonstrated that it modifies wobble uridines in specific arginine and glutamic acid tRNAs. They further showed that Trm9-deficient yeast cells were sensitive to the translational infidelity inducing aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin (Kalhor & Clarke, 2003). Cells deficient in Trm9 also display sensitivity to DNA damaging agents (e.g. MMS and IR) and have a damage induced cell cycle progression defect (Begley et al, 2002, 2004, 2007; Bennett et al, 2001; Chan et al, 2010). ALKBH8 is the most thoroughly characterized mammalian homolog of yeast Trm9 and ALKBH8 deficient cells are sensitive to DNA damaging agents (Fu et al, 2010a). ALKBH8 makes the wobble uridine modifications mcm 5U and mchm 5U. The formation of mcm 5U is required for the completion of the mcm 5s 2U, and mcm 5Um modifications (Fu et al, 2010a, b; Songe-Moller et al, 2010; van den Born et al, 2011). Mouse ALKBH8 has also been implicated in the recoding of stop codons to promote the incorporation of selenocysteine into specific proteins (Songe-Moller et al, 2010). Compared to yeast Trm9, ALKBH8 contains additional 2-oxoglutarate- and iron-dependent dioxygenase and RNA binding domains. The second yeast Trm9 homolog identified in mice and humans is KIAA1456, but there is little functional information associated with the corresponding proteins. We have tentatively designated KIAA1456 as hTRM9L (human TRM9-like protein). The hTRM9L gene encodes a protein that contains an SAM-dependent methyltransferase domain. Based on domain structure and protein size hTRM9L is similar to yeast Trm9. In humans, the hTRM9L gene maps to the end of human chromosome 8, a region commonly lost or silenced in many different cancers, including colorectal carcinoma (Ilyas et al, 1999; Kerangueven et al, 1995; Knowles et al, 1993; Prasad et al, 1998). Recent studies have implicated hTRM9L as a potential tumour suppressor gene (Flanagan et al, 2004). These studies, conducted in soft agar, demonstrated that a 250 mBp piece of DNA specific to the end of chromosome 8, where hTRM9L and other genes are located, decreased the colony formation of specific colorectal cancer lines. Wobble base modifications catalysed by yeast Trm9 and ALKBH8 proteins play important roles in stress signalling pathways, with responses to DNA damage and reactive oxygen species as prime examples (Begley et al, 2007; Chan et al, 2010; Fu et al, 2010a; Songe-Moller et al, 2010). The potential presence of a tumour suppressor on chromosome 8, in a region that encodes hTRM9L, and the linkage between tumour suppressors and stress signalling pathways led us to postulate that hTRM9L could play a role in controlling tumour growth. In this study, we show that hTRM9L is a powerful negative regulator of tumour growth and that the hTRM9L transcript is significantly down-regulated in breast, bladder, cervix, testicular and colorectal carcinomas. Further, we demonstrate that the down-regulation of hTRM9L is due to epigenetic silencing in advanced colorectal cancer cell lines. Importantly, re-expression of hTRM9L strongly inhibits SW620 and HCT116 colon carcinoma cell tumourigenicity in vivo via a senescence-like G0/G1-arrest. Further, we show that inhibition of tumour growth by hTRM9L is dependent on a functional SAM binding domain. Tumour growth inhibition by hTRM9L is linked to increased transcription of the RB interacting protein LIN9 and to a failure of hTRM9L-expressing cells to mount a hypoxic response. We also demonstrate that the hTRM9L expressing cells have a significant increase in mcm 5U and other tRNA modifications after paromomycin treatment, relative to SW620-LacZ and that hTRM9L promotes global changes in tRNA modification. Finally, we show that loss of hTRM9L in certain tumours can be exploited as a potential chemotherapeutic target since its absence renders tumour cells sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics, which induce misincorporation at specific codons leading to protein damage and selective tumour cell killing. RESULTS. Epigenetic silencing of hTRM9L in human primary cancers and cancer cell lines. Published evidence and gene expression database mining suggested that hTRM9L mRNA is down-regulated in human tumours due to epigenetic gene silencing (Flanagan et al, 2004; Rhodes et al, 2004). To assess the extent of hTRM9L mRNA down-regulation in human cancers, we examined a human tumour panel tissue array, covering 18 different cancer types with a total of 306 tumours, for the expression of hTRM9L mRNA. We found that hTRM9L is significantly down-regulated in testicular, breast and colon cancers followed by cervical and bladder carcinomas (Fig 1B). The tissue array included colon cancer tissue samples ranging from stage I through stage IV. The down-regulation of hTRM9L was more pronounced in stage IV cancer, suggesting a progressive loss of hTRM9L expression coincided with the acquisition of a more aggressive phenotype and perhaps a later event in progression. We next determined whether hTRM9L down-regulation was preserved in colorectal cancer cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR. hTRM9 transcripts were not detected in three of five cell lines tested, which included HCT116, SW1116 and SW620, while it was present in HT29 and SW480 cells (Fig 1C). However, hTRM9L transcript levels were still lower in HT29 cells than in SW480 cells. Thus, colon cancer cell lines were deemed an amenable model to dissect the mechanisms by which hTRM9L is turned off and to determine how hTRM9L might affect tumour growth. We found that treatment of HCT116 or SW620 cells with 5-aza-deoxycytidine (10 \u00a5\u00ecM), which promotes demethylation of 5-methylcytosine to cytosine upon DNA replication, resulted in the restoration of hTRM9L mRNA expression (Fig 1D and E). Methylation of tumour suppressors is thought to promote tumourigenesis (Esteller, 2005; Jones & Baylin, 2002). Thus, we tested whether treatment of the highly tumourigenic SW620 cells with 5-aza-deoxycytidine would inhibit tumour growth and whether this correlated with hTRM9L re-expression. SW620 cells were cultured in the presence of 5-aza-deoxycytidine (10 \u00a5\u00ecM) for 7 days before being inoculated on chick embryo CAMs to monitor their tumourigenicity (Fig 1F). While control cells produced rapidly growing tumours after 1 week, the 5-aza-deoxycytidine-treated SW620 cells were strongly inhibited in their tumourigenic capacity (p = 0.00001). We conclude that hTRM9L expression is either directly or indirectly regulated by DNA promoter methylation and that hTRM9L expression is inversely correlated with the tumourigenic capacity of SW620 cells. Cumulatively, our data suggests that hTRM9L might have a growth inhibitory/tumour suppressive role in certain cancers. hTRM9L-mediated inhibition of colorectal tumour growth is an evolutionary conserved function. To functionally link hTRM9L expression to tumourigenicity, we used a gain of function strategy where SW620 and HCT116 cells were engineered to over-express hTRM9L. Because the tRNA methyltransferase activity of Trm9 is conserved from yeast to mammals, we also engineered SW620 cells with the yeast TRM9 gene (yTrm9) and with mouse Alkbh8. Both the cancer cells and the respective controls expressing LacZ were tested for tumourigenic capacity in the CAM (SW620) or nude mice (SW620 and HCT116) systems. In contrast to parental, LacZ- or GFP-expressing SW620 cells, re-expression of hTRM9L, yTrm9 or Alkbh8 caused a dramatic inhibition of SW620 tumour growth on CAMs (Fig 2A?C). Injection of hTRM9L-expressing SW620 or HCT116 cells in the subcutaneous tissue of nude mice showed that re-expression of this gene resulted in a strong inhibition of tumour growth. In SW620, relative to LacZ, hTRM9L expressing cells had an extended latency that lasted for an additional week (Fig 2D) and these cells slowed down their growth rate after tumour take. This inhibition of tumour growth was reflected in a significant reduction in the final tumour mass volume compared to control LacZ cells (Supporting Information Fig S1A) and this was not only observed for SW620 cells but also when comparing HCT116-LacZ versus -hTRM9L cells (Fig 2E). We further used the SW620 model to test whether restored growth of hTRM9-expressing cells was due to loss of the transgene. To this end we tested for hTRM9L expression in the tumours that grew in vivo and we found no correlation between the presence of hTRM9L and the growth rate and size of the tumours that grew in the hTRM9L group (Supporting Information Fig S1B). Thus, other mechanisms might allow SW620 cells to eventually bypass the hTRM9L inhibitory function. To assess whether the methyltransferase activity predicted for hTRM9L was required for the inhibition of tumour growth, we individually mutated two amino acids (D91R and I108N) found in hTRM9L's evolutionarily conserved methyltransferase domain (Kalhor & Clarke, 2003; Katz et al, 2003). Due to their interaction with and use of SAM as a co-factor, most methyltransferase enzymes share this conserved domain structure consisting of three motifs (I-III) that bind and position SAM near the active site. hTRM9L, ALKBH8 enzymes and yeast Trm9 have all been reported to contain these conserved methyltransferase motifs (Kalhor & Clarke, 2003; Songe-Moller et al, 2010) and each enzyme has identical amino acids at positions 91 and 108. We also mutated an amino acid in the unassigned C-terminal region (R410E) of hTRM9L (Supporting Information Fig S1C). The resulting hTRM9L mutants (D91R, I108N and R410E) were then assessed on CAM-based xenografts, relative to SW620 cells expressing LacZ or wild-type hTRM9L. Mutations to the SAM binding domain (D91R and I108N) abolished the hTRM9L dependent growth suppression phenotype, while the R410E mutation outside the SAM binding domain had little effect (Fig 2F). Together the structure?function results support the idea that SAM binding and methyltransferase activity specific to hTRM9L is required for inhibition of tumour growth. Ultimately, our data reveal a previously unrecognized and unanticipated growth-inhibitory function of the methyltransferase activity of hTRM9L. hTRM9L induces tumour growth inhibition via a senescence-like arrest. We next explored whether the growth inhibition caused by hTRM9L was due to the induction of apoptosis, autophagic cell death and/or to a growth arrest-associated phenotype. Tumour nodules produced by SW620-LacZ or SW620-hTRM9L cells after a week in vivo were sectioned and stained for cleaved caspase-3 (Fig 3A), an apoptosis marker. This staining revealed no major difference in caspase-3 levels, which were overall <7.5%, in the hTRM9L positive or negative tumours (Supporting Information Fig S2A). This suggests that the induction of apoptosis is not a major pathway by which hTRM9L expressing cells promote growth inhibition. Staining for LC3-I/II to detect any evidence of autophagic cell death also revealed low basal levels of signal (<5%) that did not differ significantly between SW620-LacZ and SW620-hTRM9L tumour nodules (Fig 3B and Supporting Information Fig S2B). These findings suggest that hTRM9L is not inducing gross changes in apoptotic or autophagic cell death that would account for the growth inhibitory function. The detection of proliferation markers revealed that hTRM9L expression in SW620 cells caused a marked decrease in histone-3 phosphorylation (p = 0.05) at Ser-10 (Fig 3C and Supporting Information Fig S2C) a residue that is modified during G2-M transition and reveals active transition through this phase. These results support that SW620-LacZ cells are actively proliferating, while SW620-hTRM9L cells are proliferating slowly or not at all. We also detected a consistent up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21, (p = 0.01, Fig 3D and Supporting Information Fig S2D), but found no change in p27 expression in hTRM9L tumour nodules (Fig 3E). The combined effect of p21 induction and reduced P-H3 levels suggests that hTRM9L is inducing a growth arrest phenotype. We next monitored senescence-associated \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase (SA-\u00a5\u00e2-Gal) activity, heterochromatin protein 1\u00a5\u00e3 (HP1\u00a5\u00e3 expression and presence of histone-3-tri-methyl-Lysine-9 marks, all senescence markers (Narita et al, 2006; Sang et al, 2008; Xue et al, 2007; Zhang et al, 2007), in SW620-Control (GFP) or SW620-hTRM9L tumour nodules or after their digestion using collagenase-I. In these experiments, independent batches of control (GFP) or hTRM9L expressing cells were generated to allow for \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase activity measurements. We analysed \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase activity derived from either SW620-Control (GFP) or SW620-hTRM9 in 1-week old tumour nodules (Fig 3F) and found that there was a strong up-regulation of SA-\u00a5\u00e2-Gal activity in SW620-hTRM9L cells, relative to SW620-GFP, with 30% of the hTRM9L proficient and 5% of the control cells expressing SA-\u00a5\u00e2-Gal, respectively. Although some inter-experiment variability was observed for the absolute levels of senescence, hTRM9L-expressing tumour nodules were consistently higher in SA-\u00a5\u00e2-Gal activity and peaked 3 days after in vivo inoculation. Close to 80% of the hTRM9L proficient cells stained positive for SA-\u00a5\u00e2-Gal activity after 3 days and up to 7 days in vivo, with a maximum of 40% of the control cells staining positive for SA-\u00a5\u00e2-Gal activity 5-days post inoculation (Supporting Information Fig S2E). However, we detected no difference in HP1\u00a5\u00e3 staining, that displayed a nuclear signal in both SW620-GFP or SW620-hTRM9L cells in tumour histological sections (Supporting Information Fig S2F). We also detected very low levels of H3K9me3 marks in these tumour sections when comparing the same cells lines (Supporting Information Fig S2F). Our results reveal that hTRM9L-induced tumour growth inhibition in SW620 cells is not due to increased apoptosis or autophagy; rather it is caused by a growth arrest phenotype that only partially recapitulates the expression of key markers of a canonical senescence phenotype (Collado & Serrano, 2006; Narita et al, 2006; Xue et al, 2007). Thus, hTRM9L is able to induce a \u00a1\u00b0senescence-like phenotype\u00a1\u00b1 associated with SA-\u00a5\u00e2-gal activity and p21 expression up-regulation that is strongly associated with a G0/G1 arrest. hTRM9L-dependent up-regulation of the tumour suppressor LIN9 is linked to the growth inhibitory phenotype. The fact that SW620 cells are derived from a metastatic lesion and that SW480 cells are derived from the primary tumour from the same patient opened the possibility that hTRM9L might affect metastatic capacity related to invasion and dissemination. However, we did not find any clear indication that hTRM9L affects intravasation or dissemination to the liver in the chick embryo metastasis assay (Supporting Information Fig S3A and S3B), suggesting that loss of hTRM9L in the SW620 metastatic variant is not related to gain of invasion and dissemination properties in these cells. Time course analysis of CAM in vivo tumour growth revealed that 3 days after inoculation, the hTRM9L deficient cells begin to proliferate while the hTRM9L proficient cells are already in the senescence-like arrest (Fig 4A). Thus, within 24?48 h after injection, SW620-hTRM9L cells are unable to mount a strong proliferative behaviour and at day 3 this phenotypic discrepancy is significant. We performed gene expression profiling of SW620-LacZ and SW620-hTRM9L using the Affymetrix platform, to identify the signalling pathways affected by hTRM9L. We took advantage of the GFP tagging present in SW620 and sorted cells from 3-day-old tumour nodules using FACS, as this is when SW620-LacZ cells begin actively proliferating and SW620-hTRM9L cells are arrested. This strategy revealed significant changes in gene expression in only a small subset of genes that were up-regulated (25-transcripts) or down-regulated (37-transcripts) in hTRM9L expressing cells, relative to LacZ (Fig 4B, Table 1). The magnitude of gene expression change was not larger than threefold (except for hTRM9L in the SW620-hTRM9L cells). We validated these findings for a subset of transcripts to confirm the increase levels for POR, LIN9 and hTRM9L and decreased ALAS1 levels in hTRM9L-expressing cells (Fig 4C). Thus, it appears that only a limited number of genes are regulated at the transcriptional level by hTRM9L, and that they need not change dramatically in transcriptional abundance to associate with a strong growth inhibition. Among the genes induced by hTRM9L, we identified the tumour suppressor LIN9, a mammalian homolog of the C. elegans LIN9 protein that is part of the transcriptional repressor DREAM complex (also known as the LINC complex) (Pilkinton et al, 2007a; Sandoval et al, 2009). We validated that the LIN9 transcript and protein is up-regulated \u00a1\u00ad2-fold in hTRM9 expressing cells (Supporting Information Fig S3C) and reasoned that this could be one of the pathways used by such cells to induce growth arrest in xenografts. LIN9 has been demonstrated to act as a tumour suppressor itself as it can bind to pRB (Gagrica et al, 2004). We reasoned that if increased LIN9 expression in the hTRM9L expressing cells was responsible for the corresponding growth suppressive phenotypes in xenografts, then a knockdown of LIN9 in hTRM9L expressing cells should restore the proliferative phenotype associated with SW620 parental or LacZ expressing cells. Using specific shRNAs, we obtained \u00a1\u00ad93% knockdown of LIN9 in hTRM9L expressing SW620 cells (Supporting Information Table 1). We inoculated the parental and LIN9 knockdown cells and analysed for tumour formation on the CAM at 7 days. We found that knockdown of LIN9 completely reverses the hTRM9L phenotype and significantly increases the proliferation of SW620-hTRM9L expressing cells (p = 0.0001), relative to a scrambled knockdown (Fig 4D). Knockdown of LIN9 in SW620-lacZ cells did not show any significant effect on cell proliferation. Our experiment results associated with LIN9 loss of function in hTRM9L expressing SW620 cells, clearly demonstrate that part of the mechanism of tumour growth inhibition involves a known component of the DREAM complex and cell cycle machinery. hTRM9L expression prevents tumour growth under hypoxic conditions in SW620 cells. The tumour microenvironment can include multiple cellular stresses, with hypoxia being an underlying theme. We postulated that adaptation to low oxygen levels might be one of the triggers associated with the hTRM9-dependent growth suppression. To test our hypothesis, we cultured SW620-LacZ and SW620-hTRM9L cells under normoxic (21% O 2) and hypoxic (1% O 2) conditions for 12 days. We determined that the number of colonies derived from SW620-hTRM9L expressing cells was significantly reduced when cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions, relative to SW620-LacZ (Fig 5A and B). This result was in contrast to the observation that both cell types can form similar numbers of colonies under normoxic conditions. A key response pathway operating under hypoxic conditions is controlled by HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1, a transcription factor that is stabilized and targeted to the nucleus in response to decreased O 2 levels (Lisy & Peet, 2008; Yee Koh et al, 2008). In our CAM xenograft model, we tested whether the HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 pathway was perturbed in hTRM9L expressing cells, relative to SW620-LacZ. First, we performed a quantitative analysis of HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 protein levels in SW620, SW620-LacZ and SW620-hTRM9L expressing cells grown 3 days post inoculation on the CAM (Fig 5C). We determined that HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 protein levels were \u00a1\u00ad2-fold higher in hTRM9L expressing cells, relative to LacZ, a finding that was surprising as these cells fail to grow under hypoxic conditions or on xenografts. The increased HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 levels indicated that the initial response to hypoxic conditions is mounted in hTRM9L expressing cells but that it might be over-compensating because downstream signals are not activated. We monitored HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 nuclear localization under hypoxic conditions and determined that nuclear localization was occurring at similar levels (\u00a1\u00ad65%) in both hTRM9L and LacZ expressing cells (Fig 5D). These data suggest that the ability of HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 to become translocated into the nucleus upon hypoxia is not a limitation. To determine if nuclear localized HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 was somehow inactive in hTRM9L expressing cells, we used immunohistochemistry to monitor the in vivo expression of GLUT1, a prototypical hypoxia and HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 target gene (Chen et al, 2001). In each case, we counted \u00a1\u00ad400 stained SW620 cells expressing LacZ or hTRM9L and observed a highly significant difference (p = 0.0009) in GLUT1 expression. We found that while control SW620-LacZ cells were able to express high levels of GLUT1 (\u00a1\u00ad75%) that clearly localized to the plasma membrane, SW620-hTRM9 tumour sections showed a marked decrease in GLUT1 expression (\u00a1\u00ad5%) that was irregularly distributed in a membrane-like pattern (Fig 5E). There was a significant difference (p = 0.0009) in the number of GLUT1 positive cells when we compared SW620-LacZ to those expressing hTRM9L (Supporting Information Fig S4). We conclude that while HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 appears to be responsive to O 2 tensions, this does not correlate with efficient GLUT1 protein accumulation, which is required to adapt to the demands of a hypoxic microenvironment. Loss of hTRM9L in human tumours allows for selective killing of cancer cells with the translational error inducer paromomycin. A deficiency in yeast Trm9 renders cells sensitive to the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin (Kalhor & Clarke, 2003). Complementation analysis demonstrated that re-expression of either hTRM9L, human ALKBH8, or yTrm9 in trm9\u00a5\u00c4 S. cerevisiae cells could rescue the paromomycin sensitive phenotype (Fig 6A). We note that ALKBH8 provided more rescue then hTRM9L, with neither activity rescuing to levels demonstrated by yTrm9. Next using these yeast systems, we performed quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis on purified tRNA derived from wild-type, trm9\u00a5\u00c4 and trm9\u00a5\u00c4 cells expressing either yTRM9, hALKBH8 or hTRM9L. The trm9\u00a5\u00c4 yeast represents a ideal model as these mutants have been shown to be devoid of mcm 5U and mcm 5s 2U modifications (Chan et al, 2010) while providing the yTrm9 substrate cm 5U, which we have confirmed (Supporting Information Tables 2 and 3). We quantified the levels of 28 modifications, which included intermediaries in the mcm 5U and mcm 5s 2U biosynthetic pathways, as well as 22 other tRNA modifications. The mcm 5U and mcm 5s 2U modifications were only identified in wild-type, trm9\u00a5\u00c4 + yTrm9 and trm9\u00a5\u00c4 + hALKBH8 cells, with hALKBH8 only being able to generate a fraction of what we observed for wild-type cells. Notably, we observed a significant decrease in the levels of the cm 5U substrate in both hALKBH8 (p = 0.002) and hTRM9L (p = 0.006) expressing cells, relative to the trm9\u00a5\u00c4 cells, supporting the idea that both of these activities affect this yTrm9 substrate. Surprisingly, in hTRM9L-expressing cells we observed significant increases in the levels of 11 other tRNA modifications (Am, Cm, Gm, I, m 1A, m 2 2G, m 2G, m 3C, m 5C, m 7G and yW), relative to trm9\u00a5\u00c4 cells, with 10 of the 11 also significantly up-regulated in hALKBH8-expressing cells. Our data suggest that both mcm 5U/mcm 5s 2U and global reprogramming of tRNA modifications provide paromomycin resistance in yeast, which is a novel finding. Next, we postulated that hTRM9L re-expression would perhaps have a similar effect on human cells and promote a change in tRNA modification. Further as ALKBH8 is present in SW620 cells, the presence of hTRM9L may promote an increase in mcm 5U levels. Based on the yeast rescue data these changes should be prominent under translational stress conditions. We performed quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis on purified tRNA derived from SW620-LacZ and SW620-hTRM9L cells left untreated or exposed to paromomycin. We quantified the levels of 26 tRNA modifications from the four sample types (Supporting Information Tables 4 and 5). Under untreated conditions, we observed a significant increase in 10 tRNA modifications (ac 4C, Cm, Gm, I, i 6A, m 1A, m 2G, m 5Um, OHyW and t 6A) in hTRM9L-expressing cells, relative to LacZ. We also observed a significant increase in the levels of 4 tRNA modifications (ac 4C, m 1A, mcm 5U, t 6A) in hTRM9L-expressing cells after paromomycin treatment, relative to paromomycin treated SW620-LacZ. Paromomycin treatment leads to a significant decrease (p = 0.001) in mcm 5U (the ALKBH8 specific modification) levels in SW620-LacZ cells. In contrast, there was a 20% increase (p = 0.05) in mcm 5U modifications in SW620-hTRM9L expressing cells after paromomycin treatment, relative to untreated (Fig 6B). Our functional analysis supports the idea that hTRM9L can promote an increase in mcm 5U levels and other tRNA modifications, but the former might be more prominent under translational stress. This suggested that the loss of hTRM9L might render tumours less adaptable to drugs that induce translational stress and perhaps drugs like paromomycin might selectively affect tumours where hTRM9 is silenced. To test this possibility, we next determined whether a deficiency in hTRM9L was associated with sensitivity to paromomycin in human cells. To initially make this comparison, we used SW620 metastatic (hTRM9L-) and SW480 primary tumour (hTRM9L+) cells that are derived from the same patient providing a relatively isogenic system. When SW620 cells (hTRM9L?) and SW480 cells (hTRM9L+) were tested for sensitivity to paromomycin (Fig 6C), we determined that the hTRM9L deficient cells (SW620) had decreased viability relative to their hTRM9 proficient counterparts (SW480). We also found that re-expression of hTRM9L in SW620 cells rescued the sensitivity to this aminoglycoside antibiotic (Fig 6D). There appears to be a low threshold for sensitivity to paromomycin in hTRM9L-deficient cells. Further, there is little difference in paromomycin sensitivity when comparing SW480 to SW620-hTRM9L expressing cells (Supporting Information Fig 5). In the SW620 background, the sensitivity of hTRM9L deficient, versus proficient, cells was also observed using the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin (Supporting Information Fig 6). In addition, HT29 and HCT116 cells expressing hTRM9L were resistant to paromomycin, relative to LacZ expressing cells (Supporting Information Fig 6B and C). We conclude that a lack of hTRM9L, and possibly due to the inability of cells to modulate the levels mcm 5U and other tRNA modifications, may represent a deficiency in tumours that might be specifically exploited to induce killing of these tumour cells. DISCUSSION. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized function for the hTRM9L gene in regulating stress adaptation and tumour growth. We propose the following working model to account for hTRM9L's influence on cancer cell proliferation (Fig 7). hTRM9L, via its methyltransferase activity, likely influences the translation of a specific protein or proteins involved in the regulation of LIN9. While there are only a few published reports that give attention to LIN9 (Gagrica et al, 2004; Osterloh et al, 2007; Pilkinton et al, 2007a, b; Reichert et al, 2010; Sandoval et al, 2009), there is a clear connection between LIN9 and cell cycle regulation. In our system, activation of LIN9 in hTRM9L expressing cells is connected to the onset of a G0?G1 arrest and a senescence-like phenotype, which accounts for the non-proliferative phenotype. That not all markers of senescence were induced by hTRM9L expression is not unexpected as senescence is a restrictive mechanism that is evaded early during tumour progression (Beausejour et al, 2003; Narita et al, 2006; Xue et al, 2007). One possible explanation is that hTRM9L-dependent induction of LIN9, in addition to inhibiting exit from G1, short circuits the response to hypoxia and prevents cells from thriving in the oxygen poor tumour microenvironment. As part of our study, we have identified a disconnect between the translocation of HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 into the nucleus and the transcriptional regulation of corresponding targets (i.e. GLUT1). It is possible that in the hTRM9L cells LIN9 up-regulation could directly or indirectly interfere with HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 to prevent transcription of downstream genes. Modifications of tRNA bases can provide an additional level of gene regulation and have been shown to regulate the levels of specific proteins. Yeast Trm9 enhances the translation and levels of the AGA and GAA codon rich transcripts corresponding to the ribonucleotide reductase large subunits to promote an efficient response to DNA damage (Begley et al, 2007). Klungland and coworkers have provided evidence that mouse Alkbh8 and the catalysed mcm 5U wobble base modifications are vital for the translation of the reactive oxygen species detoxifying protein Gpx1 (Songe-Moller et al, 2010). Optimization of Gpx1 levels appears to be working by stop codon recoding to selenocysteine. The protein sequence for hTRM9L, structure-function results as well as the complementation and tRNA modification analysis data support that the corresponding activity can affect tRNA modification. Clearly though, the hTRM9L-associated paromomycin rescue of trm9\u00a5\u00c4 yeast cells is not due to the formation of mcm 5U and mcm 5s 2U and appears to be due to some global reprogramming of tRNA modifications. In addition, our yeast data supports the idea that ALKBH8 is the main tRNA methyltransferase used for mcm 5U and mcm 5s 2U formation. While the exact biochemical activity of hTRM9L is still in question, our yeast tRNA modification data does demonstrate significant changes to many methyl-based modifications as well as a decrease in the cm 5U substrate. Our global tRNA modification data in mammalian cancer cells also demonstrates that under basal conditions the SW620 hTRM9L expressing cancer cells have a distinct difference in the levels of 11 tRNA modifications, relative to SW620-LacZ that we have linked to a growth suppressive signal in cancer cells. Our paromomycin treatment results in SW620 cells further implicates wobble base modifications as being vital to the response. Notably, paromomycin treatment leads to a significant reduction in mcm 5U, as well as to an increase in m 5C and I modifications, in SW620-LacZ expressing cells, relative to untreated cells. These paromomycin-induced changes in tRNA modification were counteracted in SW620-hTRM9L expressing cells. Importantly, in SW620-hTRM9L cells there was increased mcm 5U levels after paromomycin treatment, compared to treated SW620-LacZ, supporting a role for hTRM9L in wobble base modification. This along with results from our structure-function studies suggests that stress-induced signals activate the methyltransferase activity of hTRM9L. Further experimentation is clearly needed to clarify the precise biochemical activity of hTRM9L. The absence of mcm 5U and mcm 5s 2U modifications in trm9\u00a5\u00c4 cells expressing hTRM9L, suggests that hTRM9L catalyses the formation of another modification, works on specific tRNA to generate mcm 5U modifications, regulates other tRNA methyltransferases or requires activation or cofactors present in mammalian but not in yeast cells. Identifying the specific biochemical activity and tRNA substrates as well as the targets of translational regulation linked to hTRM9L is needed to understand the role that this enzyme plays in tumour growth suppression. Colorectal cancer is a result of a multistep process derived from cumulative gene alterations arising from genome instability and epigenetic modifications (Ilyas et al, 1999). The hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of many genes, such as tumour suppressors, that can block transcription initiation and alter chromatin structure results in gene expression changes leading to cancer development (Esteller, 2002). Our study putatively links transcriptional silencing of hTRM9L to changes in translational and transcriptional potential that would favour tumour growth. While our experimental model was focused on colorectal cancer, we also observed a significant decrease in hTRM9L expression levels in cancers found in the testis, breast, cervix and bladder. Thus, silencing or loss of hTRM9L may be a more widespread mechanism that allows cancer cells to progress to a more aggressive state. The finding that hTRM9L results in the induction of LIN9 suggests that regulation of translation elongation via tRNA modifications is a key control point-regulating exit from G1. Elucidation of the hTRM9L regulatory pathway and of the players involved, as well as their link to the stress-induced suppression of the hypoxic response, might open a previously unrecognized paradigm of rapid signalling from translation elongation to the G1?S transition of the cell cycle. Knowledge gained from our aminoglycoside-based mechanistic studies identified a potential \u00a1\u00aeAchilles\u00a1\u00af heel' for hTRM9L deficient tumours, in that they are highly sensitive to drugs that induce translational errors. The absence of hTRM9L leads to a sensitivity to paromomycin, a finding that can be exploited to specifically target hTRM9L negative/low tumour cells. Thus, during progression, a growth advantage gained from hTRM9L silencing creates a phenotype that under specific stresses (i.e. translational) might become lethal. However, tumours might not encounter this stress in a sufficient degree that it is detrimental for their growth. A similar weakness is found in tumours that rely heavily on AKT signalling from growth factors. Increased AKT signalling is at the expense of ROS detoxifying capacity because of FOXO3a inhibition by AKT (Dolado & Nebreda, 2008; Nogueira et al, 2008). Thus, AKT high/FOXO3a low tumours become highly sensitive to ROS inducing drugs. Similarly, because hTRM9L low tumours become sensitive to paromomycin, additional drugs could be used to exploit this weakness in the clinical setting. Aminoglycoside antibiotics are an attractive class of drugs because many of the over 25 varieties are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the treatment of infections by gram-positive bacteria (Brunton et al, 2005). We propose that elucidation of the mechanism by which hTRM9L activity affects translation and paromomycin sensitivity may allow us to exacerbate this translational error phenotype for therapeutic purposes. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Cells, culture conditions and treatments. The human colorectal cancer cell lines SW620, SW480, HT29, HCT116 and SW1116 were purchased from ATCC. SW620, HT29 and HCT116 were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml streptomycin (Hyclone) at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in 5% CO 2 humidified air. SW480 and SW1116 cell lines were cultured in Leibovitz's L-15 Medium (ATCC) at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in 100% humidified air. All in vitro experiments were performed at 60?70% cell density to avoid the effects of confluence. For epigenetic reprogramming experiments, SW620 cells were treated with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM 5-aza-dC (Sigma?Aldrich) over a period of 7 days with the culture being replaced every 24 h with fresh growth media containing 5-aza-dC. We note that we did not observe any significant difference in cellular proliferation or viability when compared to SW620-LacZ and SW620-hTRM9L expressing lines grown in cell culture. Further, after 5-aza-deoxycytidine treatment, we did not observe any appreciable toxicity in either of the cell lines. For the aminoglycoside antibiotic viability assay, SW620 and SW480 cells were treated with Paromomycin Sulfate or Gentamicin Sulfate (Sigma?Aldrich) for 24 h and viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method. Yeast experiments were performed using BY4741 cells. The KIAA1456, mALKBH8, hALKBH8 and yTRM9 genes were PCR amplified with 40 base pair overhangs, directed to 40 base pairs upstream and 40 base pairs downstream of the native TRM9 locus. Each construct was targeted to the native TRM9 locus by transforming into trm9\u00a5\u00c4 cells, which were generated with a URA3 deletion cassette. Transformants were selected on 5-FOA plates and targeting was confirmed by PCR. Site directed mutagenesis of hTRM9L was performed using PCR based approaches and verified by DNA sequence analysis. The primers were designed to replace the appropriate bases to change the aspartic acid (GAC) to arginine (AGA) at position 91 (D91R mutant), and isoleucine (ATA) to asparagine (AAT) at position 108 (I108N mutant) and arginine (CGC) to glutamic acid (GAG) at position 410 (R410E mutant). Stable SW620 cells expressing each hTRM9 mutant construct were made by retroviral transduction described below. Production of stable cell lines. The hTRM9L cDNA sequence was PCR-amplified from a c8orf79 bacterial clone purchased from ATCC, subcloned into a Flag Tag Expression vector (pCMV-3X FLAG) (STRATAGENE); 3X FLAG hTRM9L was then cloned into retroviral expression vector pBabePuro (Addgene). The retroviral expression vector pBabePuro-\u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase was a generous gift from Dr. Conklin (CRC, SUNY Albany). EGFP was PCR-amplified from pMSCV sinpuro-EGFP and cloned into pBabeHygro (Addgene). Each retroviral expression construct was transfected into Phoenix-Ampho packaging cells by using Fugene6 Transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 72 h, the retrovirus-containing supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45 \u00a5\u00ecm filter to remove cellular debris. SW620 cells were infected with the viral supernatant/polybrene mixture (8 \u00a5\u00ecg polybrene per millilitre viral supernatant). Three days post-infection, the infected cells were selected for using puromycin (2.5 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml, MP Biochem.) and hygromycin (800 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml, Roche) for 7 days, after which stable cell lines were expanded. HCT116 and HT29 lines expressing hTRM9L or LacZ were constructed as described above. LIN9 knockdowns in SW620 LacZ and hTRM9L expressing cells were achieved by stable retroviral infections. pRS shRNA expression vectors against LIN9 and scrambled control were purchased from Origene. Retroviruses (pRS/HuSH Lin9 and pRS/HuSH scrambled) were produced in Phoenix-Ampho packaging cells and cell lines were first infected with the viral supernatant and then selected with the appropriate antibiotic as described above. Real-time PCR analyses. For real-time PCR, the total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) and subsequently purified by ethanol precipitation. Quantitative TaqMan PCR analysis was carried out with the ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using a TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems) in a reaction volume of 20 \u00a5\u00ecl containing 2 \u00a5\u00ecg purified RNA, 1\u00a1\u00bf Master Mix without UNG, 1\u00a1\u00bf MultiScribe and RNase Inhibitor Mix and 1\u00a1\u00bf probes and primer sets Hs00332747_m1 (KIAA1456) (TaqMan Gene Expression Assays) or 1\u00a1\u00bf HuGAPDH (Pre-Developed TaqMan Assay Reagents) according to manufacturer's protocol. The following Thermal Cycler parameters were used: incubation at 48\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 min (RT-step), denaturation at 95\u00a1\u00c6C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of the amplification step (denaturation at 95\u00a1\u00c6C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 60\u00a1\u00c6C for 1 min). All amplification reactions were performed in triplicate and the relative quantification of KIAA1456 (hTRM9L) gene expression was determined after normalization with the endogenous control, GAPDH. Data processing and statistical analyses were performed using the ABI PRISM SDS, software version 2.1 (Applied Biosystems). All mRNA data points specific to cancer lines and xenograft tumour samples represent the average of independent biological samples (N = 3), with error bars representing standard deviations and statistical significance determined using a Student's t-test. TissueScan human cancer panel. KIAA1456 (hTRM9L) expression profiling was performed using TissueScan Cancer qPCR arrays (384 format) from OriGene (OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). The qPCR array consisted of panels of normalized first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) from 18 different pathologist-verified human cancer tissues (with cancer stage ranging between I to IV). The array also included samples derived from normal tissues. Quantitative PCR analysis was carried out with the ABI PRISM 7900HT System (Applied Biosystems) and the expression level of hTRM9L in these cancer tissues was examined using the primer set Hs00332747_m1 (KIAA1456/hTRM9L) (TaqMan Gene Expression Assays) after normalization with the control gene SybrGreen \u00a5\u00e2-actin (Origene-supplied primer pair) according to manufacturer's protocol. For the tumour array panel we used technical replicates (N = 3) of each patient sample to generate average values. The average value from each tumour sample in a cancer subtype for each patient was compared to matched normal tissue using a Student's t-test. Xenografts: chick chorioallantoic assay (CAM Assay) and nude mice. Fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs (Charles River, MA) were incubated for 10 days at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a humidified atmosphere inside a hatching incubator equipped with an automatic rotator (Octagon 20, Brinsea, Somerset, UK). On the day of the experiment, each eggshell was punctured in two locations: one on the long side of the egg and one on the side over the natural air sac. By using a suction device, an artificial air sac was created to separate the CAM from the eggshell. A square window of \u00a1\u00ad1 cm was opened over the displaced CAM and sealed with a piece of sterile tape. GFP labeled SW620 cells expressing \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase or hTRM9L were detached from the plate with 2 mM EDTA in PBS and washed twice in PBS. Cells (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5) were resuspended in 50 \u00a5\u00ecl PBS containing 1 mM MgCl 2, 0.5 mM CaCl 2, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml streptomycin and then inoculated per CAM. The opening was re-sealed with tape and the eggs were placed in a stationary incubator at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 7 days or as indicated. The resulting tumours were excised and minced in a clean petri dish, then collagenased (type IA, Sigma) for 30 min at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. The number of tumour cells was counted with a haemacytometer. For nude mouse studies, SW620-LacZ, SW620-hTRM9L, HCT116-LacZ and HCT116-hTRM9L cells were detached with 2 mM EDTA, counted, and 3.75 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells in 100 \u00a5\u00ecl of PBS were injected subcutaneously into the interscapular and flank regions of 4- to 6-week-old BALB/c nu/nu mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA). Tumours were measured every 2 days or upon completion of the experiment. Tumour volumes were calculated using the formula (D \u00a1\u00bf d2)/2, where D is the longest and d is the shortest diameter. Animals were sacrificed at 7 weeks. Tumours were flash frozen for transgene detection or fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. All data points represent independent biological samples (N = 3), with error bars representing standard deviations and statistical significance determined using a Mann?Whitney test. Detection of disseminated SW620 cells via Alu-qPCR. SW620 overexpressing hTRM9 or LacZ cells were inoculated into CAMs (for details see (Kim et al, 1998) and allowed to grow for 3 days. Livers were collected and incubated with collagenase. DNA was extracted using the Extract-N-Amp kit from Sigma (XNAT2-1KT). Human Alu (hAlu) sequences were detected by quantitative-PCR. The primers for hAlu sequences were: hAlu sense (ACGCCTGTAATCCCAGCACTT) and hAlu antisense (TCGCCCAGGCTGGGTGCA). Each assay included a negative control (chicken tissue that has not been injected with human cells,) a positive control (human genomic DNA from SW620 tumour), and the experimental samples in triplicate. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cells recovered from CAM tumour tissues after collagenase treatment were washed in DMEM and resuspended in PBS, followed by Percoll purification. GFP-labeled and unlabeled SW620 cells from culture served as controls. Samples were filtered through 35 \u00a5\u00ecm mesh cell strainers (Becton Dickinson) before sorting. GFP-positive cells were collected with a FACSAria machine (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data collection was performed with FACSDiva software. On average, between 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 and 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 GFP-positive cells were collected. Total RNA of the GFP-positive population was immediately isolated using Trizol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) and subsequently purified by ethanol precipitation. RNA was prepared for microarray analysis using the WT-Ovation Pico RNA amplification system and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays using standard protocols (Microarray Core Facility, Center for Functional Genomics, University at Albany). Validation of the Microarray gene expression analysis data was carried out by the quantitative TaqMan PCR assay (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix Reagent Kit according to manufacturers protocols. Following TaqMan Gene Expression primer sets were used: Hs00332747_m1 (KIAA1456/hTRM9L), Hs00267016_m1 (POR), Hs00167441_m1 (ALAS1), Hs00542748_m1 (LIN9) or 1\u00a1\u00bf HuGAPDH (Pre-Developed TaqMan Assay Reagents). All data points represent independent biological samples (N = 3), with error bars representing standard deviations and statistical significance determined using a Student's t-test. Colony formation assay. SW620-LacZ and -hTRM9L expressing cells were seeded at a density of 50 cells per well in a 12-well culture dish and cultured for 12 days under either normoxic (21% oxygen) or hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions. Cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet (Fig 5). All data points represent independent biological samples (N = 3) with the average value and standard deviation (error bars) shown in Figures 1F, ?,22 and ?and4A4A. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunocytochemistry (ICC). For anti-phospho histone 3 (pH3), cleaved Caspase-3, LC-3, p21, p27 and GLUT1 IHC, tumours were embedded in an O.T.C. compound, sectioned at 8.0 \u00a5\u00ecm, mounted on Superfrost Plus Slides and fixed in 100% ethanol. The day before immunostaining, the sections were hydrated overnight in a humidified incubator at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. Sections were washed with PBS for 5 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X in PBS for 10 min, endogenous peroxides were inactivated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min and blocked with normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h. They were then incubated with the primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:100 overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C except for Glut-1 that was used at a dilution of 1?5000. The GLUT1 antibody (Millipore ? 07-1401) was a kind gift from Dr. David Burstein (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). Antibodies to Cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175), p-histone H3 (S10), p21 CIP1, p27 KIP were from Cell Signalling Technology and to LC-3 from Axxora, LLC. The biotinylated secondary antibody (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit) was then added and sections incubated for 1 h at RT and detected using a Vectastain ABC Kit following vendor's protocol. Diaminobenzidine solution was then added and sections were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, or until acceptable colour intensity had been reached, after which they were rinsed with deionized water. The nuclei were counterstained with Haematoxilin. For HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 IHC, SW620 LacZ and hTRM9L-expressing cells were grown on cover slips in 35 mm culture dishes (MatTek). Twenty-four hours after exposure to either normoxic or hypoxic conditions, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Fixed cells were permeabilized and incubated with monoclonal mouse Anti-Human HIF-1\u00a5\u00e1 (BD Pharmingen) at a dilution of 1:200 for 2 h. Mouse Anti HIF-1\u00a5\u00e1 was detected with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:800. Cover slips were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI nuclear stain (Invitrogen). Fluorescent images were obtained by using a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal inverted microscope with a 63\u00a1\u00bf objective. All data points represent independent biological samples (N = 3), with error bars representing standard deviations and statistical significance determined using a Student's t-test. Cytochemical detection of \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase staining. Cells from tumour nodules in vivo were attached to poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated cover slips fixed with 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde solution for 15 min. Fixed cells were then stained for the presence of \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase at pH 6.0 using the Senescence \u00a5\u00e2-galactosidase Staining Kit (Cell Signalling) according to the manufactures protocol. The number of positive stained cells was scored using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope. All data points represent independent biological samples (N = 3), with average values shown and error bars representing standard deviations. Statistical significance was determined using a Student's t-test. The paper explained. PROBLEM: The 5-year survival rate for many late stage cancers is very low, as exemplified for stage IV colorectal cancer (\u00a1\u00ad8%), and new treatment options are desperately needed to stop this disease. Cancer cells in late-stage tumours have turned off important growth inhibitory pathways and deciphering the molecular mechanisms that regulate tumour growth can provide insights for viable therapeutic interventions. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that the human tRNA methyltransferase 9-like (hTRM9L) gene is turned off in breast, bladder, testicular, cervical and colon cancers. Modeling this finding in cells derived from late stage colorectal cancers, we demonstrate that reactivation of hTRM9L and its corresponding methyltransferase activity can prevent tumour growth. This occurs via upregulation of LIN9, a known tumour suppressor, and by inhibiting the hypoxic response. Further, we show that hTRM9L deficient colorectal cancer cells are susceptible to killing by aminoglycoside antibiotics and linked this susceptibility to altered tRNA modification levels. IMPACT: Aminoglycoside antibiotics are already approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat gram-positive bacterial infections. Our study suggests that these drugs could be re-purposed to treat some late stage cancers deficient in hTRM9L. Further, hTRM9L levels could serve as a biomarker of susceptibility to these antibiotics, providing a personalized targeted therapy. MSD detection of Hif1-\u00a5\u00e1 protein levels. Three-day-old tumours were excised from the CAM, minced and resuspended in 0.5 ml of Tris Lysis buffer containing 2\u00a1\u00bf Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (supplied by manufacturer) and then processed on ice using a hand-held tissue homogenizer. Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min before separating the protein extract from cell debris by spinning them for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. A 96-Well MULTI-ARRAY Total HIF1-\u00a5\u00e1 Assay was purchased from Meso Scale Discovery (Gaithersburg, MD) and completed according to manufacturer's protocol using 20 \u00a5\u00ecg of total protein. After a 1 h incubation, wells were washed again and 1\u00a1\u00bf MSD Read Buffer was added and plate was analysed immediately by the MSD Sector 2400. All data points represent independent biological samples (N = 3). The average value is noted with error bars representing standard deviations. Quantification of tRNA modifications. The quantification of RNA modifications in tRNA by liquid-chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed as described previously (Chan et al, 2010) with several modifications. Following enzymatic hydrolysis and dephosphorylation of purified tRNA, ribonucleosides were resolved on a Thermo Scientific Hypersil GOLD aQ reverse-phase HPLC column (150 \u00a1\u00bf 2.1 mm, 3 \u00a5\u00ecm particle size) eluted with the following gradient of acetonitrile in 8 mM ammonium acetate at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and 36\u00a1\u00c6C: 0?18 min, 0%; 18?23 min, 0?1%; 23?28 min, 1?6%; 28?30 min, 6%; 30?40 min, 6?100%; 40?50 min, 100%. The HPLC column was coupled to an Agilent 6410 Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source operated in positive ion mode with the following parameters for voltages and source gas: gas temperature, 350\u00a1\u00c6C; gas flow, 10 L/min; nebulizer, 20 psi; and capillary voltage, 3500 V. The first and third quadrupoles (Q1 and Q3) were fixed to unit resolution and the modifications were quantified by pre-determined molecular transitions. Q1 was set to transmit the parent ribonucleoside ions and Q3 was set to monitor the deglycosylated product ions. A dynamic MRM program was set up to monitor modified nucleosides. The retention time, delta time, m/z of the transmitted parent ion, m/z of the monitored product ion, fragmentor voltage, and collision energy of each modified nucleoside are as follows: D, 2.15 min, 2 min, m/z 247 \u00a1\u00e6 115, 80 V, 5 V; acp 3U, 3.05 min, 2 min, m/z 346 \u00a1\u00e6 214, 100 V, 10 V; Y, 3.4 min, 2 min, m/z 245 \u00a1\u00e6 125; m 5C, 4.87 min, 2 min, m/z 258\u00a1\u00e6126, 80 V, 8 V; Cm, 5.62 min, 2 min, m/z 258 \u00a1\u00e6 112, 80 V, 8 V; m 3C, 6.33 min, 2 min, m/z 258 \u00a1\u00e6 126, 80 V, 8 V; I, 6.44 min, 2 min, m/z 269\u00a1\u00e6137, 80 V, 10 V; m 5U, 6.75 min, 2 min, m/z 259 \u00a1\u00e6;127, 80 V, 7 V; ac 4C, 7.35 min, 2 min, m/z 286\u00a1\u00e6154, 100 V, 10 V; ncm 5U, 7.42 min, 3 min, m/z 302 \u00a1\u00e6 170, 90 V, 7 V; m 7G, 7.91 min, 2 min, m/z 298 \u00a1\u00e6 166, 90 V, 10 V; Um, 8.83 min, 2 min, m/z 259 \u00a1\u00e6 113, 80V, 7V; m 1A, 9.33 min, 2 min, m/z 282 \u00a1\u00e6 150, 100 V, 16 V; cm5s2U, 9.64 min, 2 min, m/z 319187; m1I, 10.17 min, 2 min, m/z 283 \u00a1\u00e6 151; mcm 5U, 11.93min, 3 min, m/z 317 \u00a1\u00e6 185, 90 V, 7 V; m 1G, 14.98 min, 2 min, m/z 298 \u00a1\u00e6 166, 90 V, 10 V; m 2G, 17.23 min, 2 min, m/z 298 \u00a1\u00e6 166, 90 V, 10 V; m 5Um, 19.68 min, 2 min, m/z 273 \u00a1\u00e6 127, 100 V, 10 V; Gm, 21.39 min, 3 min, m/z 298 \u00a1\u00e6 152; mcm 5s 2U, 28.05 min, 3 min, m/z 333 \u00a1\u00e6 201, 90 V, 7 V; m22G, yW, 29.5 min, 2 min, m/z 509377; 30.49 min, 2 min, m/z 312 \u00a1\u00e6 180, 100 V, 8 V; Am, 32.22 min, 2 min, m/z 282 \u00a1\u00e6 136, 100 V, 15 V; OHyW, 36.65 min, 2 min, m/z 525 \u00a1\u00e6 393, 100 V, 10 V; and i 6A, 37.81 min, 2 min, m/z 336 \u00a1\u00e6 204, 100 V, 17 V.

Despite over 70,000 new cases of bladder cancer in the United States annually, patients with advanced disease have a poor prognosis due to limited treatment modalities. We evaluated Aurora kinase A, identified as an upregulated candidate molecule in bladder cancer, as a potential therapeutic target. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Gene expression in human bladder cancer samples was evaluated using RNA microarray and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. Effects of the Aurora kinase A inhibitor MLN8237 (Millennium) on cell dynamics in malignant T24 and UM-UC-3 and papilloma-derived RT4 bladder cells were evaluated in vitro and in vivo in a mouse xenograft model. RESULTS. A set of 13 genes involved in the mitotic spindle checkpoint, including Aurora kinases A and B, were upregulated in human urothelial carcinoma compared to normal urothelium. The Aurora kinase A inhibitor MLN8237 induced cell cycle arrest, aneuploidy, mitotic spindle failure, and apoptosis in the human bladder cancer cell lines T24 and UM-UC-3. MLN8237 also arrested tumor growth when administered orally over 4 weeks in a mouse bladder cancer xenograft model. Finally, in vitro sequential administration of MLN8237 with either paclitaxel or gemcitabine resulted in synergistic cytotoxic effects in T24 cells. CONCLUSIONS. Mitotic spindle checkpoint dysfunction is a common characteristic of human urothelial carcinoma, and can be exploited with pharmacologic Aurora A inhibition. Given our demonstration of the ability of the Aurora A inhibitor MLN8237 to inhibit growth of bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo, we conclude that Aurora kinase inhibitors warrant further therapeutic investigation in bladder cancer. Introduction. The Aurora kinases comprise a family of serine/threonine kinases that play an essential role in cell cycle progression, most notably during the G2 and M phases. Three human homologues, Aurora kinases A, B, and C, have been characterized, and maintain discrete functions within the cell cycle. Aurora A participates in centrosome assembly/maturation and proper function of the mitotic spindle apparatus, and thus is critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity (1?3). Aurora B localizes to the mitotic kinetochore and the mid-body of cytokinesis and facilitates function of the mitotic spindle checkpoint complex, histone-H3 phosphorylation, and cytokinesis (4). Aurora C expression is localized to the testes and is purported to overlap somewhat with Aurora B function in facilitating spermatogenesis, although its exact functions remain unclear (5,6). While the involvement of Aurora C in cancer development remains uncertain, Aurora A and B have been frequently implicated in human carcinogenesis. Both overexpression and gene amplification of Aurora A have been characterized in human tumors, and have been shown to correlate with tumor proliferation rates and prognostic markers (7?13). Indeed, forced overexpression of Aurora A can induce malignant transformation through dysregulation of mitotic processes, including the mitotic spindle checkpoint and promotion of chromosomal instability (14?16). Overexpression of Aurora B is also an established characteristic of certain human cancers, and exogenous overexpression of Aurora B is also capable of promoting tumor cell invasiveness in animal models (17?19). In human urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, increase in copy number and expression levels of Aurora A and B have been reported to correlate with pathological and clinical parameters, including tumor grade and prognostic significance (7?9,20). The critical roles of Aurora A and B in mitotic progression and their demonstrated oncogenic potential have prompted the development of Aurora kinase inhibitors as targeted anticancer agents. Several small molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases have been developed and are currently undergoing preclinical and early clinical testing. In particular, MLN8237 is a novel, orally bioavailable, second generation selective inhibitor of Aurora A. MLN8237 and its predecessor MLN8054 have exhibited efficacy against solid tumors and hematologic malignancies in preclinical models and are currently undergoing evaluation in hematological and solid cancers (21?26). Despite bladder cancer being the fourth most common cancer in men with over 70,000 new cases annually in the United States, patients with advanced disease have a poor prognosis irrespective of current surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment options, with 5-year survival rates around 20% or lower for surgically incurable patients (27?30). For patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic disease, combination chemotherapy regimens are commonly utilized, although only a small subset of patients with advanced disease are cured and minimal progress has been made in developing new therapies (28?31). Thus, alternative and/or complimentary targeted therapy for these patients may be of value in prolonging survival. In this study, we use gene expression analysis to show that components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, including Aurora kinases A and B, are broadly dysregulated in human bladder cancer. We hypothesize that this can be exploited therapeutically with Aurora kinase inhibition, and we test the antitumor activity of the selective Aurora A inhibitor MLN8237 in vitro in bladder cancer cell lines and in vivo in a mouse xenograft model. To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate Aurora kinase inhibitors specifically for bladder cancer. Materials & Methods. Gene expression analysis. Snap-frozen human samples of normal urothelium (N=10) and muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (N=8) were subjected to RNA microarray using the Affymetrix Hgu133plus2 gene array platform (Affymetrix) according to manufacturer instructions. Normal urothelium was obtained from distal ureteral samples from patients with renal cell carcinoma and no history of prior urothelial neoplasia. Ten micrograms of total RNA was processed for the expression microarrays using the Affymetrix GeneChip one-cycle target labeling kit (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs recommended protocols. The resultant biotinylated cDNA was fragmented and then hybridized to the GeneChip human genome (54,675 probe sets in total, including more than 35,000 human genes; Affymetrix). The arrays were washed, stained, and scanned using the Affymetrix Model 450 Fluidics Station and Affymetrix Model 3000 scanner using the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs recommended protocols. Expression values were generated by using Microarray Suite (MAS) v5.0 software (Affymetrix). The probes were redefined using updated probe set mappings (Bioc package: hs133phsentrezgcd; 32). The hybridizations were normalized using the robust multichip averaging (rma) algorithm implemented in Bioconductor package affy (http://www.bioconductor.org/; 33) to obtain a summary expression value for each probe set of genes (34?36). This resulted in a gene expression intensity data set containing more than 17,000 rows (genes), each of which has one numeric value representing its relative expression intensity in the sample. Gene expression levels were summarized according to the genes\u00a1\u00af physical locations using the regional expression biases package in Bioconductor (34,35). The algorithm groups the gene expression intensities by the associated gene locations. For each region (cytoband), a general test (such as binomial or t-test) is applied to determine if the gene expressions in the region are collectively higher or lower than the reference expressions. The test statistics are then output for each sample and for each cytogenetic region. Two-step quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was also performed on normal urothelium (N=3) and invasive bladder cancer (N=3) samples using the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions and SYBR Green qPCR MasterMix (Applied Biosystems). 25 \u00a5\u00ecL reactions (1X SYBR Green Master Mix, 100 picomolar forward primer, 100 picomolar reverse primer, and 100 nanomolar cDNA) in duplicate were run on ThermoGrid 96-well polypropylene PCR plates (Denville Scientific) using a 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Results were analyzed using 7500 System SDS Software v1.4 (Applied Biosystems), and t-test was used to analyze differences in expression level between normal urothelium and invasive bladder cancer. The reaction was as follows: 50 \u00a1\u00c6C for 2 min, 95 \u00a1\u00c6C for 10 s, (95 \u00a1\u00c6C for 15 s, 60 \u00a1\u00c6C for 1 min) \u00a1\u00bf50 cycles.

Cell culture and drug treatments. Human urothelial carcinoma cell lines T24, UM-UC-3, and RT4 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 media (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco). Drugs evaluated included the Aurora kinase A inhibitor MLN8237 (a kind gift from Millennium Pharmaceuticals), paclitaxel (Sigma), and gemcitabine (Sigma). MLN8237 and paclitaxel were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) and gemcitabine was diluted in sterile water. For in vitro administration of drugs, aliquots of 10 mM working solutions of each drug were stored at ?20 \u00a1\u00c6C until use. Media changes were performed one day prior to drug addition, and drugs were added directly to the culture media when cells reached 25?50% confluency. Flow cytometry. For cell cycle analysis, treated cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and fixed in a 70% ethanol/30% PBS v/v solution at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C. Samples were stained with 50 ug/mL propidium iodide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 0.05% Triton-X-100 and 1\u00a1\u00bf PBS for 2 h at room temperature before acquisition. For annexin V staining for analysis of apoptosis, cells were trypsinized, harvested, and stained with annexin V and propidium iodide using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmigen) according to manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Cells were analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) with ModFIT LT software (Verity Software House). Western blot analysis. Antibodies used included mouse anti-Aurora A (1:1000, Abcam), rabbit anti-Histone H3 (1:500, Abcam), rabbit anti-P-Aurora A-T288 (1:500, Cell Signaling Technologies), rabbit anti-P-Histone-H3 (1:500, Cell Signaling Technologies), rabbit anti-cleaved PARP (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technologies), rabbit anti-p73 (1:500, Bethyl Laboratories), rabbit anti-p53 (1:500, Cell Signaling Technologies), rabbit anti-p21 (1:500, Abcam), and rabbit anti-\u00a5\u00e2-actin (1:2000, Thermo Sci). Western blots were performed according to standard procedures and as previously detailed (37). Blots were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin diluted in TBS-T for P-Aurora A-T288 and P-Histone-H3 antibodies, or in 5% Carnation instant milk in TBS-T for remaining antibodies, for 1 hour at room temperature. Blots were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C in blocking solution and rinsed with TBS-T, followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000; Sigma) or anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000; Sigma) antibody and visualized using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Kit (Amersham). Blots were scanned for chemifluorescence using a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon 8600 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham). Immunocytochemical staining. Cells grown on cover slips were fixed with 100% methanol at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C for 15 min. Cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) in PBS-T (PBS-0.25% tween) for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted 1:50 in 1% BSA-PBS-T overnight at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C, rinsed with PBS-T, and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA-PBS-T for 2 h at room temperature. Antibodies used included rabbit anti-\u00a5\u00e2-tubulin (Sigma), mouse anti-tubulin (Sigma), mouse anti-Aurora A (Abcam), rabbit-anti-P-Aurora A-T288 (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-CENP-A (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-Cy3 (Thermo Sci), and mouse anti-Cy5 (Thermo Sci). Fluorescence, phase-contrast, and time-lapse microscopy. Cells grown on coverslips were stained with DAPI (Sigma) at 1 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL for 15 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted in 50% glycerol/PBS v/v, and imaged using a Leica DMR Upright microscope (Leica) with a Retiga EX Cooled CCD camera (Regita) and Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics). Phase-contrast microscopy was performed using the same camera setup on cells grown on cover slips and fixed as previously described without any additional staining procedures performed. For live cell time-lapse microscopy, cells were plated in 6-well plates, treated with MLN8237 or DMSO, imaged for 48 h with phase-contrast images taken every 10 min using a Leica DMIRB Inverted microscope (Leica) with CoolSNAP HQ Cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments), and processed using LAS-AF (Leica) software. Clonogenic assay. To determine clonogenic survival following treatment, cells treated for 48 h were trypsinized, counted by hemocytometer, and replated at a concentration of 200 cells per 10 cm tissue culture plate. After 8 days to allow clones to form in T24 cells and 15 days in RT4 cells (due to inherent differences in mitotic rate), plates were fixed with 100% methanol at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C for 5 min, stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 5 min, and washed three times with 1\u00a1\u00bf PBS. In vitro assessment of drug interactions. Cells were plated into 96-well plates at 1000 cells/well, and drugs were added into culture media as previously described. To evaluate drug interactions, MLN8237 was combined with either paclitaxel or gemcitabine. Drugs were administered either simultaneously for 48 h, or sequentially, with one drug for 48 h, followed by three washes with 1\u00a1\u00bf PBS and immediate addition of the second drug for 48 h. All drugs were administered at several concentrations, and all treatments were performed in triplicate. To assess cytotoxic effects, CellTiter96 AQueous Cell Proliferation assay (Promega), a MTS based assay, was performed according to manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. 96 well plates were measured for absorbance using a Wallac 1420 Victor Plate Reader (Wallac). Given the linearity of this assay, samples were expressed as a ratio of their absorbance at 490 nm to the absorbance at 490 nm of an untreated control sample. Drug-drug interactions and combination indices were measured using CalcuSyn (Biosoft) and the median-effect method of Chou and Talalay (38). Combination indices less than 0.5 were defined as synergistic interactions, and combination indices greater than 1.5 were defined as antagonistic interactions. To assess cell viability, cells plated and treated in 96-well plates as described above were washed with 1\u00a1\u00bf PBS, trypsinized and harvested, stained with 10% trypan blue (Sigma), and counted with a hemacytometer. In vivo mouse xenograft model. In vivo antitumor capacity of MLN8237 was evaluated in a mouse xenograft model of bladder cancer. For inoculation, 10 6 T24 cells in 50% Matrigel were injected into the flanks of nude mice bilaterally. Mice were divided into either the treatment group or the control group, with 8 tumors per group. MLN8237 was administered at 30 mg/kg by oral gavage 5 times weekly for 4 weeks. Mice in the control group received vehicle only. Tumors sizes were measured three times weekly. Tumor volumes were calculated by the following formula: 0.5 \u00a1\u00bf (smaller dimension)^2 \u00a1\u00bf (larger dimension). At the completion of treatment, mice were sacrificed and tumors flash frozen for staining. Staining of mouse xenograft tumors. To evaluate proliferation in mouse xenograft tumors, frozen tissue sections were thawed and fixed with 2.0% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed 3X for 10 min each, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and blocked in 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1 hour. Immunostaining was performed using anti-Ki67 diluted in blocking buffer, followed by fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody. DAPI was added before penultimate washing to stain nuclei. To evaluate cell death, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were dewaxed and rehydrated according to standard serial xylene and ethanol wash protocols and permeabilized with a 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate solution for 10 minutes. Slides were then stained using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit Fluorescein (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. For imaging, slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, H-1000), and images were collected using a Leica DMR Upright microscope (Leica) with a Retiga EX Cooled CCD camera (Regita) and Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics). Results. Mitotic spindle checkpoint genes are overexpressed in invasive urothelial carcinoma. Initial evaluation of gene expression profiles in human bladder cancer identified a general upregulation of multiple mitotic spindle genes, including Aurora kinase A. Specifically, RNA microarray using the Affymetrix Hgu133plus2 gene array platform was performed on human specimens of high-grade urothelial carcinomas of the bladder (N = 10) and normal urothelium (N = 8). This screen identified 155 genes differentially expressed at least 5-fold in the urothelial carcinoma samples compared to normal urothelium, which notably included a subset of 13 overexpressed genes with roles within the mitotic spindle checkpoint (Figure 1A). Among the transcripts overexpressed in urothelial carcinoma were Aurora A (5.6-fold increased expression) and Aurora B (6.2-fold); MAD2L1 (7.6-fold) and BUB1B (8.8-fold), two primary components of the APC/C inhibitory complex; TPX2 (9.3-fold), which interacts with Aurora A; the mitotic spindle kinesin KIF11 (7-fold); and the mitotic regulator CDC20 (11.4-fold). These data have been deposited in NCBI\u00a1\u00afs Gene Expression Omnibus and are acessible through GEO Series accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE42089\",\"term_id\":\"42089\"}}GSE42089 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc={\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE42089\",\"term_id\":\"42089\"}}GSE42089; 39). Quantitative RT-PCR on a separate set of human urothelial carcinomas and normal urothelium re-affirmed overall upregulation of these spindle checkpoint genes, with 10 of 13 genes demonstrating statistically significant differential expression levels (Figure 1B). Thus, mitotic spindle checkpoint transcripts appear to be broadly upregulated in human urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Given the function of Aurora A in mitotic progression and its demonstrated oncogenic potential in other cancers, we next focused on the potential of Aurora A as a therapeutic target in bladder cancer. MLN8237 selectively inhibits Aurora A and induces cell cycle arrest and aneuploidy in bladder cancer cell lines. We used the Aurora A-specific inhibitor MLN8237 to evaluate the effects of Aurora A inhibition on the human urothelial carcinoma cell lines T24 and UM-UC-3, which were derived from high-grade urothelial carcinoma and have acquired mutations in TP53 (40?42). As a control, we used the RT4 cell line, which originated from a benign urothelial papilloma and expresses wildtype TP53 (43). Baseline evaluation showed detectable levels of phospho-Aurora A in all cell lines by both immunofluorescent localization and western blot analysis (Figure 2A?B). Application of 10 nM to 1 \u00a5\u00ecM MLN8237 resulted in a loss of phospho-Aurora A at the mitotic spindle (Figure 2A) and a dose-dependent reduction in phosphorylation of Aurora A (Figure 2B). Application of MLN8237 did not affect total Aurora A levels, and did not appear to alter Aurora B status within the cells as measured by phospho-histone-H3 expression as an indicator of Aurora B function (Figure 2B). Next, we used flow cytometry to assess the effect of MLN8237 on cell cycle dynamics. Treatment of T24, UM-UC-3, and RT4 cells with 10 nM to 1 \u00a5\u00ecM MLN8237 for 48 h induced significant cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C). Considering only non-polyploid cells (DNA content \u00a1\u00c2 4N), the proportion of cells with 4N DNA content increased from 9% with no treatment to 72% with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM MLN8237 in T24 cells, from 10% to 84% in UM-UC-3 cells, and from 22% to 92% in RT4 cells. This is consistent with a G2/M arrest or a G1 tetraploid cell population. Moreover, MLN8237 induced a significant increase in aneuploidy in the malignant T24 and UM-UC-3 cell lines, but no increase in aneuploidy in the benign RT4 cell line. The proportion of all cells that were aneuploid (DNA content > 4N) increased from 17% with no treatment to 54% with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM MLN8237 in T24 cells and from 10% to 89% in UM-UC-3 cells, but remained stable in RT4 cells. MLN8237 induces distinct cellular phenotypes in benign and malignant bladder cells. To further characterize the phenotype of Aurora A inhibition, we used microscopy to visualize the cellular phenotype and mitotic spindle during cell cycle arrest induced by MLN8237. Treatment of malignant T24 cells with 100 nM MLN8237 for 24 h resulted in a significant increase in cell size, whereas treatment of RT4 cells had no apparent effect on cell size (Figure 3A). In addition, a minority of T24 cells appeared morphologically to be in mitotic arrest, with rounded cell morphology, condensed DNA, and multipolar spindles (Figure 3B ). Both cell lines demonstrated disruption of the mitotic spindle and formation of aberrant multipolar spindle apparatuses following MLN8237 treatment (Figure 3B). T24 and RT4 cells were also triple-stained with tubulin, CENP-A, and DAPI and imaged with immunofluorescence microscopy. CENP-A staining was utilized to estimate relative centromere number and thus compare ploidy between treated and untreated cells. MLN8237-treated T24 cells demonstrated markedly increased DNA content and CENP-A staining per cell, whereas RT4 cells did not (Figure 3C). These results are consistent with the flow cytometry analysis that showed increases in aneuploidy with MLN8237 treatment in the malignant T24 cell line. Immunofluorescent staining for total Aurora A showed expected localization of the protein to mitotic spindles under baseline conditions in both RT4 and T24 cells (Figure 3D). However, inhibition of Aurora A activity with 100 nM MLN8237 resulted in enhanced expression of Aurora A in the malignant T24 cells only, with augmentation of Aurora A expression both at the mitotic spindle and within the cytoplasm, although the mechanism behind this finding is unclear. Finally, time-lapse microscopy was performed to further visualize cell division dynamics following MLN8237 treatment. T24 cells treated with 100 nM MLN8237 exhibited repeated attempts at mitosis within a 24 h period with no increase in cell number over time (i.e. unsuccessful cytokinesis), resulting in a dramatic increase in cell size (Figure 3E). Treated RT4 cells, in contrast, appeared to arrest shortly after the first attempt at mitosis, with no subsequent increase in cell size. Taken together, these results demonstrate that repeated cell cycle progressions despite failure in separation of daughter cells in malignant T24 cells, but not benign RT4 cells, account for the development of aneuploidy in the former cell line following MLN8237 treatment. Cytotoxicity and differential apoptotic processes mediate MLN8237\u00a1\u00afs effects. Given the dramatic cell cycle arrest caused by MLN8237, we sought to quantify growth inhibition induced by this compound in our cell lines. MLN8237 was administered at concentrations ranging from 0.316 nM to 3.16 \u00a5\u00ecM to T24, UM-UC-3, and RT4 cells for 96 h (Figure 4A). MTS assay was used to quantify cell viability, with individual data points expressed as relative standardized absorbance compared to untreated controls. MLN8237 was most potent in T24 and UM-UC-3 cells (IC50 of 31 nM and 45 nM, respectively), and least potent in RT4 cells (IC50 of 120 nM). To assess apoptosis, we evaluated protein expression of cleaved PARP, p53, p21 and p73 in RT4 and T24 cells. Application of 100 nM MLN8237 resulted in an increase in PARP cleavage expression in RT4 and T24 cells by 24 h. RT4 cell lines, which contain wildtype p53, demonstrated a peak in p53 expression at 24 h after initiation of MLN8237 treatment, with a subsequent increase in the expression of p21, a downstream mediator of p53, through 72 h (Figure 4B). In contrast, T24 cells contain mutated p53; in this cell line an increase in p73 expression was apparent at 24 h, whereas p53 and p21 expression remained unaltered. To quantify apoptosis, annexin V staining and flow cytometry were performed on T24 and RT4 cells. Both cell lines demonstrated an increase in the apoptotic cell population starting at 24 h after initiation of MLN8237 treatment, although this population was greater in the T24 cells (Figure 4C). Thus, T24 cells appear to be more sensitive to MLN8237 as demonstrated by the combination of a lower IC50 and a more sizeable apoptotic response as measured by annexin V staining (Figure 4A,C). Finally, to assess long-term viability post-treatment, clonogenic assays were performed on RT4 and T24 cells. Treatment of both T24 and RT4 cells with 100 nM MLN8237 for 48 h resulted in less than 10% of cells maintaining capability to form clones in either cell line, and less than 1% clonogenic capability was detected in T24 or RT4 cells treated with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM MLN8237 (Figure 4D). MLN8237 inhibits tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. To assess the capacity of MLN8237 to reduce tumor growth in vivo, nude mice were inoculated with T24 cells in the subcutaneous flank tissue to induce growth of tumors (N=8 for treatment group, N=8 for control group). When tumor sizes reached 250 mm 3, a 4 week regimen of MLN8237 30 mg/kg orally 5 times weekly was initiated. No statistically significant difference in tumor size between the control and treatment groups was noted at initiation of treatment (t-test P > 0.05). Mice treated with MLN8237 exhibited arrest of tumor growth compared to the control group (Wilcoxon rank-sum P < 0.05), and showed no statistically significant difference in tumor size between initiation of treatment and completion of the 4 week regimen (t-test P > 0.05; Figure 5A). In contrast, untreated control mice exhibited dramatic increases in tumor growth, with tumor sizes quadrupling within 2 weeks of initial treatment. Due to the rapid rate of tumor growth in the control population, this experimental group was terminated by day 15 of treatment. To further illustrate the antitumor activity of MLN8237 in vivo, tumors were harvested and stained with hematoxylin/eosin, Ki67, and TUNEL. Tumors treated with MLN8237 showed decreased cellularity compared to tumors from control mice, as well as regions of cell death and fibrosis (Figure 5B). The MLN8237 treated group also exhibited a 50% decrease in percentage of cells staining positive for Ki67 and a 10-fold increase in percentage of cells staining positive for TUNEL (t-test P < 0.05; Figure 5B). MLN8237 exhibits schedule-dependent synergism with paclitaxel and gemcitabine in vitro. Finally, we evaluated the response of the T24 bladder cancer cell line to MLN8237 in combination with either paclitaxel or gemcitabine ? two agents currently used for the treatment of advanced bladder cancer. Drugs were administered either simultaneously for 48 h, or sequentially, with one drug for 48 h, followed by washout and immediate addition of the other drug for 48 h. MTS assay was used to quantify cell viability, and combination indices were calculated to determine synergism or antagonism. Effects of combination treatments were compared to control treatments with a single drug. Combination treatments demonstrated the greatest reduction in cell viability when drugs were dosed sequentially. Sequential administration of MLN8237 followed by either paclitaxel or gemcitabine resulted in synergistic interactions, most prominently at lower concentrations of the second drug (Figure 6). For example, when paclitaxel was administered alone, 1.6 nM paclitaxel produced 30% of maximal reduction in cell viability, but when paclitaxel was administered after 100 nM MLN8237, 1.6 nM paclitaxel achieved 70% of maximal reduction in cell viability. Likewise, 4 nM gemcitabine along produced 48% of maximal reduction in cell viability, whereas 4 nM gemcitabine administered sequentially following 100 nM MLN8237 was able to achieve 87% of maximal reduction in cell viability. Sequential administration of either paclitaxel or gemcitabine followed by MLN8237 resulted in largely additive effects. Notably, MLN8237 was much less effective when concurrently administered with either paclitaxel or gemcitabine, as simultaneous administration of MLN8237 with either paclitaxel or gemcitabine produced largely antagonistic effects. To further demonstrate that combination treatments are cytotoxic and inhibit cell viability, the percentage of cells staining positive for trypan blue was computed. Combination treatments resulted in increased percentage of cells staining positive for trypan blue, with sequential dosing regimens having the greatest effect (Figure S1). Finally, we used flow cytometry to evaluate the effects of combination regimens on the cell cycle. For both MLN8237/paclitaxel and MLN8237/gemcitabine combinations, sequential dosing regimens produced the most significant extent of cell cycle arrest, while simultaneous dosing regimens were the least effective in causing additional cell cycle arrest (Figure S2). For example, sequential administrations of MLN8237 and paclitaxel produced a broad aneuploid cell population with no predominance of a single ploidy, whereas simultaneous MLN8237 and paclitaxel administration resulted in a cell cycle profile indistinguishable from that of MLN8237 treatment alone. Discussion. Despite bladder cancer being the fourth most common cancer in men in the United States, the molecular processes that underlie its development are relatively understudied. In order to identify new putative drug targets, we compared gene expression profiles between normal urothelium and patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, and identified global upregulation of mitotic spindle-associated genes. While overexpression of the Aurora kinases in bladder cancer has been previously described, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a broad overexpression of mitotic spindle checkpoint components as a common characteristic of human bladder cancer. Although the Aurora kinases currently represent the most accessible therapeutic target amongst the genes we identified, other members of the mitotic spindle checkpoint may warrant further study as potential clinical biomarkers of disease or alternate drug targets. With the goal of exploiting this pathway as anticancer therapy, we evaluated the impact of the Aurora kinase A inhibitor MLN8237 on bladder cancer cells in vitro. Application of MLN8237 to papilloma-derived RT4 cells and malignant T24 and UM-UC-3 urothelial carcinoma cells resulted in cell cycle arrest, mitotic spindle failure, and eventual apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, Aurora A inhibition induced aneuploidy in malignant bladder cells but not in the RT4 cell line, we suspect due to intact p53 function in RT4 cells that allows for cell cycle arrest following mitotic failure. This is in agreement with previous reports of activation of a p53-dependent post-mitotic checkpoint as a mechanism of preventing aneuploidy if the spindle checkpoint fails (44?46). In contrast, increased p73 expression appears to drive apoptosis in the p53-deficient T24 cell line. Our results are consistent with a previous report of p73-dependent apoptosis following Aurora A inhibition in p53 mutant cells (47). Given the high incidence of p53 mutations in human bladder cancer, activation of an alternate apoptotic pathway following Aurora A inhibition constitutes an important mechanism for achieving cell death. In addition, the differential IC50 values suggest increased potency of Aurora kinase A inhibition in malignant cells, supporting the conclusion of higher sensitivity in these cells. We also examined the ability of MLN8237 to provide efficacy as a component of a multidrug regimen. Simultaneous administration of MLN8237 and either paclitaxel or gemcitabine in vitro revealed an antagonistic relationship, whereas sequential administration resulted in a synergistic interaction. This is in agreement with previous reports of additive and synergistic effects when Aurora kinase inhibitors are sequentially dosed in combination with other agents, including nucleoside analogs and taxols (48?50). These results suggest that the induction of spindle checkpoint dysfunction by MLN8237 can potentiate the ability of paclitaxel and gemcitabine to induce cell cycle arrest, and underscore the potential of MLN8237 as either an independent or concurrent agent in bladder cancer. Finally, we demonstrated the in vivo capacity of MLN8237 to arrest tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of bladder cancer. In other studies, MLN8237 has been shown to have similar antitumor activity in animal models and in early clinical testing, but has not been evaluated specifically in bladder cancer. Our demonstration of decreased tumor size, associated with cell drop-out and reduced proliferation index, following MLN8237 administration in a mouse xenograft model of bladder cancer is consistent with current published findings of tumor response to this drug. Nevertheless, we recognize that our in vivo model was limited to an evaluation of 8 tumors in a lone treatment group. We anticipate that a more expansive study in the future could delineate the varying antitumor effects of different dosages and of combination regimens. The demand for improved pharmacological options for bladder cancer represents a timely opportunity for testing Aurora kinase inhibitors in bladder cancer, either alone or in conjunction with currently established therapies. In this study, we identify spindle checkpoint dysregulation as a common feature of human urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Targeting this pathway with the Aurora A inhibitor MLN8237 induced cell cycle arrest, aneuploidy, spindle abnormalities, and apoptosis in bladder cancer cell lines, and arrested tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Based on these findings, we believe that the mitotic spindle checkpoint in human bladder cancer warrants further investigation to identify and characterize the mechanisms of spindle checkpoint failures that lead to tumorigenesis, and to explore the anticancer potential of drugs that target this pathway, including Aurora kinase inhibitors. Statement of Translational Relevance. Despite poor outcomes for patients receiving chemotherapy, bladder cancer remains a relatively understudied disease with little advancement in non-surgical treatment modalities in the last few decades. We sought to identify pathways in human bladder cancer that could be exploited with targeted therapies, leading us to identify mitotic spindle checkpoint dysfunction and to evaluate the effects of the Aurora kinase A inhibitor MLN8237 in bladder cancer. While Aurora kinase overexpression has been previously described in bladder cancer, to our knowledge, this study represents the first preclinical evaluation of aurora kinase inhibitors specficially for bladder cancer. Based on our mechanism-based hypothesis of the efficacy of Aurora kinase inhibition in bladder cancer, as well as our validation of in vitro findings using a mouse xenograft study and our demonstration of schedule-dependent synergistic effects between MLN8237 and gemcitabine and paclitaxel, we feel strongly that this pathway warrants further therapeutic investigation in bladder cancer.

                "text": "Inhibiting proliferation of gefitinib-resistant, non-small cell lung cancer\tPurpose. Sensitivity to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is correlated with the presence of somatic mutations that affect the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Development of resistance to TKI is a major therapeutic problem in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Aim of this study is to identify agents that can overcome TKI resistance in NSCLC. Methods. We used a carefully selected panel of 12 NSCLC cell lines to address this clinical problem. Initially, the cell lines were treated with a variety of 10 compounds. Cellular proliferation was measured via MTT assay. We then focused on the gefitinib-resistant, EGFR mutant cell lines [H1650: exon 19 and PTEN mutations; and H1975: exons 20 (T790M) and 21 (L858R)] to identify agents that could overcome TKI resistance. Results. Both 17-DMAG (Hsp90 inhibitor) and belinostat (histone deacetylase inhibitor, HDACi) effectively decreased the growth of almost all NSCLC lines. Also, belinostat markedly decreased the expression of EGFR and phospho-Akt in the cells. Combination of 17-DMAG and belinostat synergistically inhibited in vitro proliferation of these cells. Furthermore, both agents and their combination almost completely prevented TKI-resistant tumor formation (EGFR T790M mutation) in a xenograft model. Conclusion. These results suggest that the combination of 17-DMAG and belinostat should be examined in a clinical trial for TKI-resistant NSCLC cell. Electronic supplementary material.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, accounting for one-third of worldwide deaths from cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 80?% of lung cancers [1, 2]. The epidermal growth factor (EGFR) is an important therapeutic target in NSCLC [3]. Gefitinib was the first small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that received FDA approval in 2003 [4]. Initial clinical studies found that only a minority of individuals with NSCLC responded to either gefitinib or erlotinib [5]. Asian non-smoking females were noted to be particularly sensitive to this class of drugs [4, 6]. Soon, investigators discovered that sensitivity to these TKIs was correlated with somatic mutations of the kinase domain of EGFR, such as either deletions within exon 19 or a L858R mutation in exon 21 [3, 7?9]. Individuals with these tumors often responded to TKI therapy, but usually had progressive disease after 6?12?months of therapy. These resistant tumors often acquired either an additional mutation (T790M) in exon 20 of EGFR or a second mutation in the downstream pathway of EGFR, both resulting in the development of resistance to EGFR-TKI [10?12]. A major therapeutic priority is to discover drugs and/or drug combinations that can inhibit proliferation of NSCLCs after they have developed an EGFR mutation that renders these cells TKI-resistant. After examining 10 different potential therapeutic compounds, we focused on two of the most active: 17-DMAG (Hsp90 inhibitor) and belinostat (HDACi). The Hsp90 chaperone complex is necessary for stability and activity of client proteins required for cellular homeostasis [13], and inhibition of Hsp90 results in proteasome degradation of its client proteins [14]. HDACi acetylates both histones and thousands of nonhistone cellular proteins confounding our understanding of how they mediate their anticancer affect. 17-DMAG and belinostat have different modes of action and toxicities. We found that both compounds potently suppressed proliferation of NSCLC cells, and when combined, they markedly inhibited these cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that this drug combination overcomes TKI resistance in NSCLC cells. Materials and methods. Reagents and NSCLC cell lines. The following compounds were used in this study: LY-333531 [ALEXIS Biochemicals (CA, USA)]; cisplatin [APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC (IL, USA)]; panobinostat [Selleck Chemicals (TX, USA)]; gefitinib; paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine and dasatinib [LC Laboratories (MA, USA)]; and 17-DMAG and belinostat [provided by National Cancer Institute (USA)]. All reagents were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and the final concentration of DMSO never exceeded 0.1?% in culture. Antibodies, Akt (pan), phospho-Akt (Ser473), p70S6K, phospho-p70S6K (Thr421/Ser424), EGF receptor, phospho-EGF receptor (Tyr1068) and GAPDH were purchased from Cell Signaling (MA, USA). The human NSCLC cell lines: H1299, H1666, H460, H520, PC9, HCC827, H1650 and H1975 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HCC2279, HCC2935, HCC4006 and H820 were kindly provided by Dr. Roman K. Thomas (Max Planck Institute for Neurological Research). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10?% fetal calf serum, 100?U/ml of penicillin, and 100?\u00a5\u00ecg/ml of streptomycin. The H1975 and H820 cell lines had EGFR T790M mutations in exon 20, associated with gefitinib and erlotinib resistance. Cell proliferation assays. NSCLC cells were seeded at a density of 4,000?15,000 per well in 96-well plates. After 24?h, cells were cultured with multiple concentrations of drugs for 72?h. Cell proliferation was determined by using CellTiter 96 \u00a2\u00e7 Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions, and the plates were read by a fluorescence spectrometer. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (\u00a1\u00b0IC 50-values\u00a1\u00b1) were determined from the images under the growth inhibition curves using Prism 4.0 software. Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and lysed in ProteoJET Mammalian Cell Lysis Regent (Fermentas) supplemented with ProteoBlock Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Fermentas). Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Equal amounts of protein were dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate?polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample loading buffer and electrophoresed in a polyacrylamide gel (7.5 or 10?%). After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was performed using each antibody and detected by ECL-Plus reagent (Amersham, Boston, MA). In vivo experiments. Murine experiments were done in accord with a protocol reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee at the University of Singapore, in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The TKI-resistant (EGFR exons 20 and 21 mutations) H1975 cells (1?\u00a1\u00bf?10 7 cells) in the presence of matrigel (BD Biosciences) were injected into the flanks of nude mice (Biological Resource Center Singapore) (day 1). Each treatment group consisted of two tumors on the flanks of seven to eight mice. Doses of drugs (day 2?day 30) were as follows: belinostat (50?mg/kg); 17-DMAG (15?mg/kg); and combination therapy (belinostat 50?mg/kg and 17-DMAG 15?mg/kg). After day 30, dose of drugs was decreased: belinostat (25?mg/kg); 17-DMAG (7.5?mg/kg); and combination therapy (belinostat 25?mg/kg and 17-DMAG 7.5?mg/kg). The drugs were given intraperitoneally (i.p.) every other day. Control mice received i.p. injections with the diluent l-arginine (100?mg/kg) in water. Every tumor was measured with a caliper every other day, and the volume was calculated using the formula: (long diameter)?\u00a1\u00bf?(short diameter) 2/2. At the end of experiments, blood chemistries were measured (ALP, CRE, GLU, PHOS, CA, BUN, AST, ALT, TBIL, TP, AMYL, ALB, Na, K, Cl and LDL). The mice were anesthetized, and their tumors were carefully dissected, weighted, and divided into half. Half was used for immunochemistry, and the other was used for real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry. Paraffin-embedded tumor sections (4?\u00a5\u00ecm) were placed on glass slides. This was followed by deparaffinization, rehydration, blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity and heat-induced antigen retrieval. The slides were stained with murine monoclonal Ki67 [clone MIB1(dilution 1: 100), DakoCytomation (CA, USA)]. The signal was detected using the MACH 2 Mouse HRP Polymer [Biocare Medical (CA, USA)]. All sections were visualized with the diaminobenzidine reaction and counterstained with hematoxylin. Statistical analysis. Data were collected using a minimum of three experiments and used to calculate the mean?\u00a1\u00be?SD. Statistical significance was calculated using ANOVA or Bonferroni/Dunn multiple comparison test was considered significant at p values <0.05. Results. Growth inhibition of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC. A panel of NSCLC cell lines were selected to encompass three groups: cohort #1, no mutation of EGFR (H1666, H460, H1299 and H520); cohort #2, EGFR mutation of either exon 19 or 21, and an additional TKI resistance-inducing mutation (H1650, H1975 and H820); and cohort #3, EGFR mutation of exon 19 and sensitive to TKI inhibitors (PC9, HCC827, HCC2279, HCC2935 and HCC4006) [Table?1]. The cellular proliferation of this panel of 12 NSCLC cell lines was examined by MTT over 72?h in the presence of increasing concentrations of a variety of compounds (gefitinib, dasatinib, panobinostat, belinostat, 17-DMAG LY-333531, cisplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel and docetaxel). Dose?response curves were generated, and the concentration that caused 50?% growth inhibition (IC 50) was calculated (Table?1). Almost all cell lines were highly sensitive (IC 50 range 0.037?0.29?\u00a5\u00ecM) to dasatinib (src inhibitor) except the EGFR \u00a1\u00b0wild-type\u00a1\u00b1 cell lines H1666 and H460 (IC 50 range >10?\u00a5\u00ecM). All NSCLC cell lines were highly sensitive (IC 50 range 0.0006?0.14?\u00a5\u00ecM) to panobinostat (HDACi), and almost all NSCLC cell lines were sensitive (IC 50 range 0.29?1.2?\u00a5\u00ecM) to belinostat (HDACi) except the EGFR-normal H1666 cell line (IC 50 range >10?\u00a5\u00ecM). 17-DMAG (Hsp90 inhibitor) (IC 50 range 0.0005?0.095?\u00a5\u00ecM) and paclitaxel and docetaxel (mitotic inhibitors) (IC 50 range 0.0014?0.029?\u00a5\u00ecM) had prominent antiproliferative activity. LY-333531 (PKC\u00a5\u00e2 inhibitor) required a high concentration (IC 50 range 4.7 to >10?\u00a5\u00ecM) to inhibit cell growth. H1650 and H820 cells (EGFR mutant, TKI-resistant) were more resistant (IC 50 0.65, 1.2?\u00a5\u00ecM, respectively) to gemcitabine (nucleoside analog) than the EGFR \u00a1\u00b0wild-type\u00a1\u00b1 cell lines (IC 50 range 0.17?0.4?\u00a5\u00ecM). Antiproliferative activity of cisplatin (platinum-based chemotherapy) was also correlated with their EGFR gene mutational status (p?=?0.0486) (EGFR mutant, TKI-sensitive?>?EGFR wild-type?>?EGFR mutant, TKI-resistant) (Supplement Fig.?1). Inhibition of EGFR expression. A representative NSCLC cell line of each group [\u00a1\u00b0wild-type\u00a1\u00b1 (H460 cells), TKI-resistant (exon 19 and PTEN mutant, H1650 cells) and TKI-sensitive (exon 19 mutant, PC9 cells)] was selected for further study. Mutant EGFR is a major driver of cell proliferation. 17-DMAG, belinostat, panobinostat and docetaxel decreased the levels of EGFR in cells from all three NSCLC groups (Fig.?1a). 17-DMAG, belinostat and panobinostat also decreased the levels of EGFR in H1975 cells (EGFR exons 20 and 21 mutations and TKI-resistant) (Supplement Fig.?2A). Dasatinib did not decrease expression of EGFR in the cells with either wild-type EGFR or exon 19 mutant, PC9 (Fig.?1a). Inhibition of activated Akt (p-Akt) downstream of EGFR. Activated Akt (p-Akt) is one of the important molecules in the activated EGFR signaling pathway. 17-DMAG attenuated the expression of p-Akt in all three subgroups of cell lines (Fig.?1b). Belinostat decreased levels of p-Akt in the TKI-resistant [H1650 and H1975 (Supplement Fig.?2B)] and TKI-sensitive (PC9) EGFR mutant cell lines. In contrast, expression of total Akt either decreased only modestly or even increased in the three subtypes of NSCLC after exposure to each of the compounds (Fig.?1b). We also examined the ability of these two agents to inhibit p-Akt after serum starvation and short exposure (4?h) to EGF (Fig.?2). This model system tests the ability of the compound to inhibit a major growth stimulation pathway after exposure to activating ligand. Belinostat decreased p-Akt in H460 (EGFR wild-type) and PC9 (TKI-sensitive), but not in H1650 cells (TKI-resistant); however, starting levels of p-Akt in these cells were extremely low after EGF stimulation alone (Fig.?2a). 17-DMAG did not modulate levels of p-Akt in H460 (EGFR wild-type), but did decrease expression in the PC9 cells (TKI-sensitive) and the H1650 cells (TKI-resistant) (Fig.?2b). Combination of 17-DMAG and belinostat markedly inhibits cell proliferation of NSCLC in vitro. The above data suggested that both 17-DMAG and belinostat can inhibit growth of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Therefore, we examined whether the combination of 17-DMAG and belinostat versus either alone had an enhanced antiproliferative activity in H1650 cells. Co-treatment with 17-DMAG (5, 10 or 20?nM) and belinostat (100, 250 or 500?nM) inhibited growth of H1650 NSCLC cells (EGFR exon 19 and PTEN mutations), greater than either inhibitor alone, with 10?nM of 17-DMAG and either 250 or 500?nM of belinostat showing synergistic antiproliferative activity (Fig.?3a, columns 12 and 15, Fig.?3b). Likewise, the combination of 17-DMAG and belinostat synergistically inhibited the growth of the H1975 cells (TKI-resistant) (Fig.?4). The most effective combination was 250?nM of belinostat with 20?nM of 17-DMAG (Fig.?4a, b). In the presence of 250?nM of belinostat, IC 50 of 17-DMAG was 13?nM (Fig.?4c). Combination of 17-DMAG and belinostat inhibits the in vivo growth of tumors derived from TKI-resistant human NSCLC cells. Immunodeficient mice with xenografts of H1975 cells (EGFR exons 20 and 21 mutations and TKI-resistant) were treated with 15?mg/kg of 17-DMAG and/or 50?mg/kg of belinostat (every other day). Control mice received diluent alone. 17-DMAG, belinostat and their combination suppressed nearly completely the tumor growth with no significant difference in tumor size between each treatment group (data not shown). All of these mice had no apparent toxicity. In order to determine whether enhanced suppression tumor growth occured in the drug combination, we decreased by 50?% the dose of each compound on day 30 (7.5?mg/kg, 17-DMAG and/or 25?mg/kg, belinostat). Tumors of the Belinostat-treated mice increased more than those of the 17-DMAG-treated mice. Combination of 17-DMAG and belinostat was more effective than either drug alone. Examining for drug toxicities was analyzed on day 54 for 16 different blood chemistries; no significant differences occurred between control and experimental mice (data not shown). Likewise, the mice were weighed every other day, and no significant difference occurred in their weights. The mice were euthanized, and tumors were carefully dissected and weighed (Fig.?5a). Mean tumor weight of each individual treatment group was significantly less than that of the control cohort (p?<?0.05, belinostat, p?<?0.001, 17-DMAG). The mean weight of the tumors in the combination group was significantly less than that of either treatment cohort alone (p?<?0.001) (Fig.?5a, b). 17-DMAG and the combination of belinostat and 17-DMAG treatment produced extensive necrosis with neutrophil infiltration (Fig.?5c). Protein was extracted from the tumors and Western blotted (Fig.?5d). Levels of p-EGFR, total EGFR, p-Akt, and p-p70S6K were decreased by each of the treatments compared to control. Total p70S6K was only decreased in tumors of mice that received either 17-DMAG or the combination of 17-DMAG and belinostat (Fig.?5d). Discussion. A major clinical problem often occurs for patients who have either an exon 19 or 21 mutation in their EGFR gene. These patients respond to gefitinib, but after a period of time, their tumors develop a T790M exon 20 mutation. These tumors no longer respond to the drug. We show here that tumors with T790M mutations are inhibited in their proliferation by belinostat or 17-DMAG. Furthermore, the combination of both of these compounds synergistically inhibits growth of these tumors. The growth inhibitory effects of either belinostat or 17-DMAG were independent of the EGFR mutational status of the cells (p?=?0.2323, p?=?0.4455, respectively) (Supplement Fig.?1B, C); thus, their inhibitory activities were quite different from gefitinib. Effective cell kill by gefitinib was highly correlated with the presence of somatic mutations of EGFR (exons 19 and 21), affecting the kinase domain of EGFR (p?<?0.0001) (Supplement Fig.?1A). In contrast, the \u00a1\u00b0EGFR mutant, TKI-sensitive\u00a1\u00b1 cohort was more resistant to cisplatin than was the \u00a1\u00b0wild-type\u00a1\u00b1 and the \u00a1\u00b0EGFR mutant, TKI-resistant\u00a1\u00b1 cell lines [IC 50 average 15.2, 5.0 and 2.83 (\u00a5\u00ecM), respectively] (Supplement Fig.?1D). Belinostat treatment decreased the levels of EGFR in all subtypes of NSCLC (Fig.?1a), resulting in downregulation of EGFR signaling pathway, thus blunting potential EGFR-mediated antiapoptotic and pro-survival signals. Belinostat (500?nM) treatment decreased within 24?h, the constitutive levels of phospho-Akt in H1650 cells (TKI-resistant, EGFR exon 19 and PTEN mutations) and PC9 cells (TKI-sensitive, EGFR exon 19 mutation). We previously showed that a HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat) profoundly decreased the levels of members of the activated Akt pathway in lymphoma cells, associated with their decreased proliferation [15]. The p-Akt in H460 cells (EGFR wild-type) was not decreased by belinostat (Fig.?1b). The lack of effect on constitutively activated p-Akt in these cells may be explained because H460 cells have a mutation of PI3K and KRAS [16]. Thus, belinostat may not be able to inhibit the ability of mutant PI3K and KRAS to activate Akt (Fig.?1b). The mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors suppress oncogenic pathways is unclear. One hypothesis is that HDAC inhibitors activate \u00a1\u00b0tumor suppressor genes\u00a1\u00b1 that subsequently result in growth inhibition, differentiation and apoptosis of cancer cells [17]. We previously combined a HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat) and a demethylating agent and noted the initiation of expression of a number of tumor suppressor genes in a variety of tumors including NSCLC, endometrial, prostate, ovary and pancreatic cancers [15, 18?22]. HDAC inhibitors also have the ability to regulate a number of key regulatory processes through acetylation of nonhistone proteins including p53, STAT, FOXO, HIF-1\u00a5\u00e1, E2F1 and pRb [17, 23]. The HDAC inhibitor, belinostat, most likely suppresses several different oncogenic pathways, including the PI3K-Akt pathway as well as the activated EGFR (Fig.?1a, b). The Hsp90 chaperone helps mediate the conformational maturation of several families of hormone receptors, transcription factors and kinases [24]. Inhibition of Hsp90 prevents its association with its client proteins, resulting in the conformational change of these target proteins causing an ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of the target proteins [25]. Cancer cells may be particularly dependent on chaperone proteins to survive a hypoxic, nutrient-starved microenvironment [26]. In addition, through the process of \u00a1\u00b0oncogene addiction,\u00a1\u00b1 cancer cells may be dependent on either overexpressed or mutant kinases for viability, and hence making them particularly sensitive to Hsp90 inhibition. Mutant EGFR can mediate oncogenic addiction, and a Hsp90 inhibitor can prominently lower the levels of this addicting protein as shown by others [27] and ourselves here. We and others showed that 17-DMAG decreased the levels of EGFR in all subtypes of NSCLC, showing that this Hsp90 inhibitor modulates these receptors independent of the EGFR mutational status (Fig.?1a) [28]. Furthermore, Hsp90 stabilizes the active (phosphorylated) form of Akt since inhibition of binding of Akt-Hsp90 resulted in Akt dephosphorylation causing a loss of Akt kinase activity [24, 25, 29]. We found that 17-DMAG decreased the levels of activated Akt in all subtypes of NSCLC (Fig.?1b). Furthermore, when these cells were serum-starved and stimulated by EGF, 17-DMAG blunted the activation of p-Akt in H460 cells and PC9 cells (Fig.?2b). Therefore, the decrease in p-Akt in response to 17-DMAG may be related to both depletion of upstream EGFR, as well as direct effects on stability and phosphorylation of Akt. Early clinical trials have presented a mixed picture. Use of IPI-504, a water-soluble Hsp90 inhibitor monotherapy [randomized phase II trial] in advanced NSCLC, did not show clinical activity [30]. Another Hsp90 inhibitor, [ganetespib (STA-9090)], showed promising disease control in previously heavily pretreated NSCLC patients [phase II trial]. This drug appeared to be effective in all subsets of NSCLC including those with EGFR mutations, ALK translocations and KRAS mutations [31]. Combination of 17-DMAG and belinostat resulted in in vitro enhanced inhibition of proliferation of the TKI-resistant NSCLC cells (Figs.?3, ?,4).4). A previous study showed that panobinostat caused acetylation of Hsp90, reducing its association with mutant EGFR, Akt and STAT3, resulting in ubiquitination and depletion of these growth-promoting proteins in NSCLC cells [24, 25]. Therefore, our combination of a HDAC and a Hsp90 inhibitor may lead to a profound disruption of the chaperone function of Hsp90 with its client proteins, resulting in increased polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of the client protein. In addition, we showed that either 17-DMAG or belinostat, or their combination inhibited TKI-resistant NSCLC xenografts growing in immunodeficient mice (Fig.?5a). Further, the combination of both therapies prominently decreased the mean tumor weight compared to tumor weights of those mice who received either belinostat or 17-DMAG alone (Fig.?5b). Similar to our in vitro results, Western blotting of cell lysates of tumors showed that either belinostat or 17-DMAG decreased expression of EGFR, p-Akt and its downstream signaling molecules (Fig.?5c). These mice had no chemical or physical manifestations of toxicity. In summary, our data show that belinostat and 17-DMAG markedly inhibit the proliferation of the TKI-resistant NSCLC cells associated with decreased levels of both EGFR and activated Akt (p-Akt). Combination therapy with these compounds has the potential to be a therapeutic strategy for patients with EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLCs. Electronic supplementary material. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Targeted Therapy for BRAF V600E Malignant Astrocytoma\tPurpose. Malignant astrocytomas (MAs) are aggressive central nervous system tumors with poor prognosis. Activating mutation of BRAF (BRAF V600E) has been reported in a subset of these tumors, especially in children. We have investigated the incidence of BRAF V600E in additional pediatric patient cohorts, and examined the effects of BRAF blockade in preclinical models of BRAF V600E and wild-type BRAF MA. Experimental Design. BRAF V600E mutation status was examined in two pediatric MA patient cohorts. For functional studies, BRAF V600E MA cell lines were used to investigate the effects of BRAF shRNA knockdown in vitro, and to investigate BRAF pharmacologic inhibition, in vitro and in vivo. Results. BRAF V600E mutations were identified in 11 and 10 percent of MAs from two distinct series of tumors (6 of 58 cases total). BRAF was expressed in all MA cell lines examined, among which BRAF V600E was identified in four instances. Using the BRAF V600E specific inhibitor PLX4720, pharmacologic blockade of BRAF revealed preferential anti-proliferative activity against BRAF V600E mutant cells in vitro, in contrast to the use of shRNA-mediated knockdown of BRAF, which inhibited cell growth of glioma cell lines regardless of BRAF mutation status. Using orthotopic MA xenografts, we demonstrate that PLX4720 treatment decreases tumor growth and increases overall survival in mice bearing BRAF V600E mutant xenografts, while being ineffective, and possibly tumor promoting, against xenografts with wild-type BRAF. Conclusions. Our results indicate a 10% incidence of activating BRAF V600E among pediatric MAs. With regard to implications for therapy, our results support evaluation of BRAF V600E specific inhibitors for treating BRAF V600E MA patients. Introduction. Malignant astrocytomas (MAs) are aggressive brain tumors that affect people of all ages. Current treatments are inadequate, with median survival being 14 months in adults (1). A recently published study involving the use of radiation and temozolomide in treating 90 pediatric patients with malignant astrocytoma revealed only 22% survival at 3 years (2). While the genomics of adult grade IV MA (i.e., glioblastoma: GBM) have been researched extensively, and in some cases comprehensively (3, 4), pediatric studies have been more limited. For the most part, our current understanding of the genetic etiology of pediatric MAs is based on the examination of selected genes most commonly altered in corresponding adult tumors. The results of such studies indicate that the incidence of two of the most common gene alterations in adult MAs, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification and PTEN inactivation, are significantly reduced in pediatric MAs (5,6). In contrast, other genetic alterations that have been linked with the pathogenesis of adult MA, such as those resulting in TP53 and CDKN2A inactivation, occur at significant frequencies in pediatric MAs as well (7?9). The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway relays extracellular signals from cell membrane-based RTKs to the nucleus via a series of consecutive phosphorylation events (10,11). RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of adult MAs (12), and increasing evidence supports the importance of this pathway in the development of pediatric MAs as well (13?15). Activation of the RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling in adult MA is usually associated with abnormal signaling of upstream RTKs, such as EGFR and Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR) (3). Inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes a RAS-GTPase, also leads to the activation of this pathway in adult MA (3, 16). Oncogenic mutation of other RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling components, such as K-RAS, N-RAS or BRAF, which commonly occur in a wide variety of human cancers, is infrequent in adult MA (17). Recent publications suggest that RAF gene alterations occur at a higher frequency in pediatric astrocytomas, including pilocytic astrocytomas, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, and MAs (13, 18). There are three RAF family proteins: A-, B-, and CRAF (RAF-1). In rodent brain, ARAF is rarely expressed, whereas both BRAF and CRAF are expressed in normal CNS tissue (19). ARAF has the lowest intrinsic kinase activity, followed by CRAF, with BRAF having highest intrinsic activity (20). All three RAF isoforms share RAS as a common activator, and MEK as a common substrate (21). With respect to the genes encoding these proteins, BRAF T1799A (BRAF V600E) is the most common activating mutation, occurring in a broad spectrum of human tumors (22). BRAF V600E is constitutively active, requires neither interaction with RAS nor dimer formation in order to signal, and is refractory to negative feedback inhibition (23). A recent report from our group describes activation of MAP kinase signaling in nearly all pediatric MAs, some of which have associated BRAF V600E (13). The discovery of activating BRAF mutation in pediatric MA\u00a1\u00afs provides a unique opportunity to improve treatment outcomes for a subset of patients with this devastating disease. Small molecule kinase inhibitors that specifically target BRAF V600E have recently been developed and shown remarkable efficacy against melanomas that harbor this mutation (24). A recent phase I study using BRAF V600E specific inhibitor PLX4032 showed a response rate of 81% in a group of 48 patients with BRAF V600E positive metastatic melanoma (25). In the present study, we confirm the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in two additional cohorts of pediatric MA. To investigate the importance of BRAF V600E to MA growth, BRAF expression was suppressed in multiple MA cell lines by shRNA knockdown, with resultant determination that reduced levels of BRAF decreases ERK phosphorylation and results in decreased cell growth irrespective of tumor cell BRAF V600E status. In contrast, a BRAF pharmacologic inhibitor shows BRAF V600E dependency with regard to in vitro and in vivo MA anti-proliferative effects. Materials and Methods. Cell lines, xenografts, and primary tumors. MA cell lines (Fig. 1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, DSMZ ? the German Resource Centre for Biological Material, and the Japan Health Sciences Foundation Health Science Research Resources bank. Normal human astrocytes (NHAs) were obtained from Clonetics and AllCells. All cell sources were authenticated through DNA fingerprinting using the Promega Powerplex platform. Patient tissues from Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, and Newcastle Royal Infirmary, UK, were obtained after approval by Local and Multicenter Ethical Review Committees. Tumor DNAs were extracted from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues and whole genome amplified, as described previously (15). For the St. Jude tumors, sections from FFPE tissue were reviewed by two neuropathologists for identification of specimens suitable for DNA extraction from corresponding snap-frozen specimens, as previously described (26). BRAF sequencing. The BRAF V600E hotspot region was amplified using primers BRAF_Ex_15_FFPE_F (TTCATGAAGACCTCACAGTAAAAA) and BRAF_Ex_15_FFPE_R (CCACAAAATGGATCCAGACA), which are designed to yield correct target sequence product by touchdown PCR. DNA was sequenced in both directions using the di-deoxy chain termination method on an ABI 3730 DNA Sequencer. Results were examined using the Applied Biosystems Sequence Scanner Software v1.0. Western Blot analysis. Cells and tissues were lysed in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with proteinase (Roche) and phosphatase (Sigma) inhibitor cocktails. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. After probing with primary antibodies, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and visualized by ECL (Pierce). Antibodies specific for total ERK, p-ERK, total MEK1/2, p-MEK1/2, total AKT, p-AKT-Ser473, CYCLIN D1, CYCLIN D3, CDK4 and CDK6, and p27 KIP1, were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies. Antibody specific for BRAF was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CRAF from Upstate Biotechnology, and \u00a5\u00e1-TUBULIN from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). Lentivirus mediated BRAF shRNA expression. Constructs for stable suppression of BRAF expression were obtained from The RNAi Consortium via Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). A total of 12 constructs were obtained and tested to identify those able to achieve efficient BRAF protein knockdown. Negative control constructs in the same vector system (vector alone and scrambled shRNA) were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). The lentiviral helper plasmids pHR'8.2 R and pCMV-VSV-G were also obtained from Addgene. The integrity of all plasmids was confirmed by restriction analysis, and the integrity of all shRNA inserts was confirmed by sequencing. Lentivirus preparation and infection of GBM cell lines have been described previously (27). Cell growth assay. Stably infected GBM cells were plated into 96-well plates at a density of 100?500 cells/well and the medium was changed every three days. After selected incubation times, cell viabilities were determined with \u00a1\u00aeCellTiter Glo Kit\u00a1\u00af from Promega and/or \u00a1\u00aeCell Counting Kit-8\u00a1\u00af from Dojindo Molecular Technologies. All cell growth analyses were conducted with 4?8 replicates. Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle distributions were determined by flow cytometric analysis following staining with propidium iodide. In brief, exponentially growing cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol, then stained in PBS-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml RNase, and 50 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml propidium iodide, for 60 min at room temperature. The fluorescence was measured on a FACSort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and data were analyzed using ModFit software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Small molecule inhibitors used in association with cell cycle analysis were PLX4720 (Plexxikon Inc., Berkeley, CA), Sorafenib, and GDC-0941, with the latter two obtained from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX). Modification of tumor cells with firefly luciferase reporter. Lentiviral vectors containing firefly luciferase (Fluc) were generated as previously described (28). AM-38 human MA cells were transduced with Fluc lentivirus as previously described for U87 cells (29). Cells were screened in vitro for transduction efficiency by treatment with luciferin (D-luciferin potassium salt, 150 mg/kg, Gold Biotechnology, St Louis, MO), and analysis for luminescence using a Xenogen IVIS Lumina System (Xenogen Corp., Alameda, CA). In Vivo Experiments. Five-week-old female athymic mice (nu/nu genotype, BALB/c background) were purchased from Simonsen Laboratories (Gilroy, CA). Animals were housed under aseptic conditions. The UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal protocols. Tumor cells were implanted into the brains of athymic mice as previously described (30). In vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was performed using the Xenogen IVIS Lumina System coupled to LivingImage data-acquisition software (Xenogen Corp.). Mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg of ketamine and 10 mg/kg of xylazine and imaged 10 minutes after intraperitoneal injection of luciferin. Signal intensity was quantified using LivingImage software. To evaluate the therapeutic response of intracranial glioma xenografts, mice implanted with luciferase-modified MA cells were randomized to vehicle control (DMSO) or PLX4720 treatment groups. Mice receiving PLX4720 treatments were administered a daily dose of 20 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection for 14 consecutive days. Treatment was initiated at day 7 post implantation of tumor cells. All mice were monitored every day for the development of symptoms related to tumor burden, and 1?2\u00a1\u00bf weekly by BLI. Mice were euthanized when they exhibited symptoms indicative of significant compromise to neurologic function. The Kaplan?Meier estimator was used to generate survival curves, and differences between survival curves were calculated using a log-rank test. In addition to the mice used for the survival analysis, two pre-symptomatic mice within each cohort were sacrificed two hours after their seventh treatment, with their brains resected and either placed in formalin and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis, or dissected from surrounding normal brain and snap frozen for immunoblot analysis. IHC was performed as previously described (30), using Ki-67 antibody from Ventana Inc. Results. BRAF V600E Mutation in Malignant Astrocytomas. In follow-up to our previous finding of BRAF V600E mutation in pediatric MAs (13), BRAF V600E status was determined in two additional tumor cohorts. As shown in Table 1, BRAF V600E mutation was found in three out of 28 tumors in the ICR cohort, and three out of thirty tumors in the cohort from St Jude. Interestingly, all BRAF V600E mutations in these series were identified in MAs of grade IV malignancy (i.e., GBM). Our previously published study (13) combined with results in the current report indicate a BRAF V600E mutation frequency of 14% (11 of 78) in grade III + grade IV pediatric MAs. As in our previously report (13), BRAF V600E mutations and PDGFRA amplifications were found as mutually exclusive in the additional cohorts being reported here (supplemental Tables 1s, 2s). For the combined 78 MA\u00a1\u00afs in 3 series of pediatric tumors, 9 instances of PDGFRA amplification were determined (12%: Tables 1s?3s). To confirm sustainable tumor cell sources for BRAF V600E associated investigation, we examined 20 MA cell lines, 15 of which had been previously analyzed for BRAF V600E (22), for mutant sequence (supplemental Table 4s). This analysis confirmed V600E mutation in cell lines DBTRG-05MG, AM-38, NMC-G1, and KG-1-C. Three of 4 cell line mutations are heterozygous for BRAF V600E (supplemental Fig. 1s), with BRAF V600E homozygosity evident in AM-38 cells. Previously published data (22) combined with our results indicate a 10% incidence (4 of 41) of BRAF V600E in MA cell lines. BRAF copy number and expression in MA cell lines and pediatric tumors. We examined the extent of variation in BRAF protein expression among MA cell lines, and in relation to BRAF expression in normal human astrocytes (NHA). Modest increases in BRAF protein were evident in 16 (80%) tumor cell lines relative to NHA (Figure 1). Only one cell line, 42MGBA, expressed appreciably less BRAF than NHA. Analysis of normalized BRAF expression values indicates that BRAF V600E status is not a significant determinant of tumor BRAF expression (supplemental Figure 2s, panel A), nor of BRAF copy number (supplemental Table 4s), for MA cell lines. Examination of BRAF mRNA expression in pediatric MAs (UCSF tumor series: see supplemental Table 3s) also indicates a lack of association between BRAF V600E status and BRAF expression (supplemental Fig. 2s, panel B), as well as between BRAF V600E and BRAF copy number (Table 3s). We also assessed CRAF, p-ERK, and p-MEK levels in the MA cell lines, with results showing more variability in CRAF expression than was evident for BRAF (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation of ERK was readily detectable in all of the MA cell lines except 2 (8MGBA and 42MGBA: Fig. 1). Inspection of the phospho-ERK levels indicates no apparent association with either BRAF expression level or BRAF V600E status. In contrast, a clear association is indicated between BRAF V600E status and phospho MEK levels (Fig. 1). Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and in vitro growth of MA cell lines by BRAF shRNA. Lentivirus expressing BRAF shRNA were screened for ability to suppress BRAF protein expression. Construct 6289 was the most effective in this regard (Fig. 2A), and was used to develop isogenic derivatives from four BRAF V600E and four wild-type BRAF cell lines. Western blot results show that decreased BRAF protein is associated with suppression of ERK phosphorylation, as well as with inhibition of growth for all cell lines tested (Fig. 2A,B for representative results; additional results shown in supplemental Fig. 3s). shRNA-mediated knockdown of BRAF results in G1 phase arrest and altered expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins. The anti-proliferative effects of BRAF suppression were further investigated by comparison of cell cycle distributions for BRAF shRNA and control shRNA cells. In each of the four BRAF V600E cell lines, BRAF knockdown increased G1 phase fractions, primarily at the expense of cells in S phase (Fig. 3A). A lesser extent of G1 increase from BRAF shRNA knockdown was evident in T98G cells, whereas shRNA knockdown resulted in little or no change in G1 fraction for the 3 additional wild-type BRAF cell lines. Although initial inspection of the cell cycle distributions could be interpreted as indicating that BRAF shRNA knockdown has little effect on the sub-G1 fraction of all MA cell lines, substantially higher sub-G1 increases were, in fact, evident in two of the four V600E cell lines (supplemental Figure 4s). The RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway activates several key cell cycle regulatory proteins to promote G1 to S transition (10). In particular, ERK activation has been shown to induce cell proliferation by increasing CYCLIN D1 and decreasing p27 KIP1 levels in various cell types (31?34). Western blot results for the 4 BRAF V600E cell lines showed that BRAF knockdown increased p27 KIP1 or decreased CYCLIN D1, or both (Fig. 3B). For the MA cell lines with wild-type BRAF, shRNA suppression resulted in decreased CYCLIN D1 and increased p27 KIP1 in 42MGBA and LN229, respectively. Investigation of additional cell cycle regulatory proteins revealed that BRAF knockdown significantly decreased CYCLIN D3 protein in all MA cell lines except DBTRG-05MG (Fig. 3B). Protein levels of CDK4 or CDK6, or both, were also reduced by BRAF shRNA in all of the cell lines. PLX4720 suppresses MEK-ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation in MA cells containing BRAF V600E mutation. As a complementary approach to investigating the suppression of BRAF expression in MA cells, we examined anti-proliferative effects of the small molecule inhibitor PLX4720, a tool compound that is closely related to the PLX4032 inhibitor currently being evaluated in clinical trials against melanoma harboring BRAF V600E (25). Dose-response curves for AM-38 and DBTRG05-MG (both BRAF V600E), and 42MGBA (wild-type BRAF) show that PLX4720 inhibits cell growth irrespective of cell line V600E status (Fig. 4A), but that the two lines with BRAF V600E are sensitive to much lower concentrations of the inhibitor: the EC 50 for DBTRG-05MG and AM-38 is 1.75 and 6.19 \u00a5\u00ecM respectively, whereas the EC 50 of 42MGBA is 31.20 \u00a5\u00ecM. Corresponding western blot results (Fig. 4B) show that PLX4720 inhibits phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in a dose dependent as well as a BRAF V600E dependent manner. In DBTRG-05MG and AM-38 cells, 2 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 decreased EGF-induced MEK and ERK phosphorylation, whereas 50 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 was needed to inhibit EGF induced MEK/ERK phosphorylation in 42MGBA cells. Importantly, the lowest dose of PLX4720 (2 \u00a5\u00ecM) led to an activation of MEK/ERK signaling in 42MGBA, likely secondary to paradoxical activation of wild-type BRAF, as previously described (35?37). Analysis of cell cycle distribution effects of 2 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 treatment revealed increased G1 fraction and reduced S phase component in BRAF V600E cells (Fig. 4C), with the opposite response observed in wild-type BRAF cells: i.e., decreased G1 and increased S phase cell components for 42MGBA. At 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 treatment, the G1 and S phase responses of 42MGBA were reversed relative to 2 \u00a5\u00ecM responses, and despite indication of residual p-MEK/p-ERK (Fig. 4B). This reversal in effect is potentially associated with inhibitor off-target effects, as suggested by decreases in 42MGBA p-AKT at 10 and 50 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 treatments (Fig. 4B). Because 42MGBA has reduced expression of BRAF compared to NHA one might predict these cells to be less representative of wild-type BRAF MA cell response to BRAF inhibition. To address whether the lack of effect of PLX4720 on wild-type BRAF glioma cells was unique to 42MGBA, a second wild-type BRAF cell line, U87, was also tested for PLX4720, with similar results obtained as for 42MGBA: i.e., low dose PLX4720 treatment results in paradoxical activation of p-MEK and p-ERK, with corresponding decreases and increases in U87 G1 and S phase components, respectively (supplemental Fig. 5s). Importantly, PLX4720 signaling pathway response for both wild-type BRAF (U87) and BRAF V600E (AM-38) cells were reproducible in serum-supplemented media (supplemental Fig. 6s). Interestingly, 2 and 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 resulted in little change to the subG1 component of treated BRAF V600E cells (Fig. 4C). To address whether this lack of response was due to alternative signaling pathway protection from apoptosis, we examined the effect of concurrent BRAF + PI3K/mTOR inhibition. As shown in Figure 7s, combined PI3K/mTOR and BRAF blockade leads to a further increase in G1 arrest, but no significant increase in subG1 component. This result suggests that MA cells primarily depend on the PI3K/mTOR and BRAF pathways for proliferation. To address whether observed cell line responses to RAF inhibition were specific to treatment with PLX4720, we additionally tested wild-type BRAF and BRAF V600E cells with sorafenib, a pan-RAF inhibitor. As shown in supplemental Figure 8s, whereas sorafenib induces a dose dependent decrease in p-MEK and p-ERK in both AM-38 and U87 cells, these signaling pathway changes occur without substantial change to the cell cycle distributions of either type of cell. Thus, the anti-proliferative effect of BRAF inhibition is specific to the use of the BRAF V600E selective-inhibitor PLX4720 against BRAF V600E cell lines. PLX4720 represses growth of intracranial BRAF V600E MA xenografts. To investigate the effects of BRAF pharmacologic inhibition in vivo, we utilized an orthotopic xenograft model approach, in which tumor cells, modified with a luciferase reporter, are monitored for response to treatment, following intracranial injection in athymic mice. Mice with intracranial AM-38 showed reduced intracranial tumor growth from PLX4720 treatment, relative to corresponding vehicle-treated mice, resulting in significantly prolonged survival (Fig. 5A). The survival of mice with intracranial DBTRG-05MG was also significantly extended from treatment with PLX4720 (data not shown). AM-38 tumors in mouse brain, following one week of PLX4720 treatment, showed decreased Ki-67 staining, relative to tumor from a vehicle treated mouse (supplemental Fig. 9s panels A and B), corroborating the in vivo anti-proliferative treatment effect indicated by bioluminescence imaging. Western blot analysis of protein extract from AM-38 intracranial xenografts revealed that PLX4720 therapy decreases p-ERK (supplemental Fig. 9s, panel C), consistent with in vitro results (Fig. 4). To determine whether PLX4720 shows activity against wild-type BRAF xenografts, we established intracranial tumors with U87 cells that had been previously modified with luciferase lentivirus and used for investigation of response to cdk4/6 inhibition (29). PLX4720-treated mice bearing wild-type BRAF U87 xenografts showed no delayed tumor growth or survival advantage, consistent with in vitro results of U87 which indicated low sensitivity to PLX4720 (U87 EC 50 of 48.8 \u00a5\u00ecM, data not shown). In fact, results from bioluminescence monitoring indicated increased mean U87 xenograft growth rate, as well as reduced survival from PLX4720 treatment (Fig. 5B). Results from Ki-67 staining of PLX4720-treated U87 tumors showed consistency with bioluminescence imaging results: Ki-67 positive cells were more abundant in PLX4720 treated tumor (supplemental Fig. 9s, panels D and E). Discussion. Patients with malignant astrocytomas have a poor prognosis. Despite aggressive therapy, relapse rates are high, with median survival being 14 months in adults (1), and the majority of pediatric MA patients succumbing to cancer within 3 years of diagnosis (2). There is a relative dearth of information regarding recurrent molecular characteristics in pediatric MAs that can be used for therapeutic hypothesis testing. PDGFRA amplification, though noted in a fraction of these tumors (13, 14, 38), has yet to be successfully exploited for improved MA patient outcomes from the use of PDGF receptor inhibitors (39). This is also the case for EGFR amplification in adult MA\u00a1\u00afs, for which the use of EGF receptor small molecule inhibitors has yet to confer a clear survival benefit (40, 41). The lack of success in targeting EGF and PDGF receptors in treating brain tumor patients is perhaps a result of receptor tyrosine kinase functional redundancy that compensates for the blockade of just one type of RTK (42). In principle, pathway blockade downstream of RTKs may be more successful, since numerous RTKs converge on a few key signaling nodes in promoting cell proliferation. In this study, we found that BRAF may represent such a point of signal convergence, since the growth of all tested MA cell lines was inhibited by suppression of BRAF expression (Fig. 2). Although gain of function mutation of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF are among the most frequently occurring oncogene alterations in cancer, such mutations are uncommon in adult MAs (17, 18). In spite of the low mutation incidence, RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling is upregulated in most of these tumors, and high ERK activation correlates with poor prognosis for MA patients (43). In this report, we confirm the finding of BRAF activating mutations (BRAF V600E) in a subset of pediatric MAs. BRAF V600E was identified in 6 of 58 (10%) pediatric MAs, from two distinct series of tumors, as well as in 4 MA cell lines. In vitro, BRAF V600E mutation was associated with elevated p-MEK levels. Because BRAF is located on chromosome 7 (q35), and gain of chromosome 7 is frequently detected in MAs, BRAF copy number is commonly increased in these tumors (44). We also found copy number gains of BRAF in most MA cell lines and primary tumors, although no focal or high-level BRAF amplifications were evident (Tables 3s, 4s). In addition to BRAF copy number increases and mutation, we found elevated expression of BRAF protein, relative to normal human astrocytes, in a majority of MA cell lines (Fig. 1). Our results show that inhibition of BRAF expression by shRNA knockdown leads to decreased p-ERK levels as well as reduced proliferation of MA cell lines, independent of BRAF V600E status (Fig. 2; supplemental Figure 3s). However, inspection of flow cytometry results from BRAF shRNA modified cells (Fig. 3A), for cell cycle effects of BRAF shRNA, reveals a more rapid anti-proliferative effect of BRAF knockdown on BRAF V600E cells, suggesting increased cellular proliferation dependence on, and addiction to BRAF signaling for BRAF V600E cells. This dependence is further indicated by results from BRAF pharmacologic inhibition with PLX4720, which show specificity of anti-proliferative effect for tumor cell lines and xenografts with V600E (Figs. 4 and ?and5).5). PLX4720 BRAF blockade resulted in MAPK pathway inhibition, decreased growth rate, and increased G1 arrest in cell lines with BRAF V600E, whereas BRAF wild-type cells, when treated with low doses of PLX4720, show increased MAPK activation and a decrease in G1 phase cells. Observation of a stimulatory effect of BRAF inhibition on MAPK activation in cells with wild-type BRAF has been reported by others (35?37). It is important to note that BRAF V600E inhibition did not promote substantial apoptotic response of BRAF-mutant cells, and that combined BRAF + PI3K/mTOR blockade led only to further G1 arrest, without increased subG1 component (Fig. 7s). These data suggest that MA cells primarily depend on the PI3K/mTOR and BRAF pathways for proliferation, and not so much for survival. To extend in vitro observations to the in vivo setting, we generated intracranial xenografts using MA cell lines with and without BRAF V600E. Our results (Fig. 5) demonstrate that BRAF inhibition by PLX4720 significantly decreases tumor growth rate (as indicated by quantitative BLI), with corresponding increase in survival for mice carrying BRAF-mutant xenografts, and to an extent showing reasonable consistency with length of treatment. Experiments are ongoing to determine maximal extent of PLX4720 survival benefit, given sustained daily treatment, and using multiple MA models. Molecular analysis of PLX4720 treated BRAF V600E tumors shows decreased p-ERK in vivo (supplemental Fig. 9C), as well as decreased Ki-67 staining (supplemental Fig. 9A, 9B). These results are consistent with the decreased tumor cell proliferation indicated by BLI monitoring. In contrast, U87 xenografts, harboring wild-type BRAF, did not respond to PLX4720, and, in fact, showed a trend towards increased tumor growth rate and decreased survival (Fig. 5B, supplemental Fig. 9D, 9E). BRAF V600E is now a validated therapeutic target in metastatic melanoma, with high response rates reported using both the Plexxikon BRAF V600E specific inhibitor PLX4032 (25) and the Glaxo Smith Kline inhibitor GSK2118436 (45). Phase III studies suggest a survival advantage for patients treated with PLX4032, when compared to standard chemotherapy (46). Taken together with the results reported here, there is a highly supportive rationale for using BRAF specific pharmacological inhibition in treating MAs with BRAF V600E. Statement of Translational Relevance. Malignant astrocytoma (MA) is the most common histopathologic subclassification for primary central nervous system cancer, and the outcome for patients with MA is dismal. In the current study we demonstrate a 10% incidence of BRAF V600E in pediatric MAs, and demonstrate that a BRAF small molecule inhibitor has substantial activity against intracranial xenografts established from BRAF V600E MA cells, while being ineffective against intracranial xenografts established from wild-type BRAF MA cells. This finding suggests that patients with BRAF V600E MA can be effectively treated with BRAF-specific small molecule inhibitors. Because there is a clinically approved analogue for the BRAF inhibitor we have used in our studies, we anticipate these results to have immediate impact with regard to stimulating clinical trial evaluation of BRAF small molecule inhibitors for treating patients with BRAF V600E MA.

                "text": "De-repression of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 transcription promotes acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in glioblastoma patients\tAcquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) represents a major challenge for personalized cancer therapy. Multiple genetic mechanisms of acquired TKI resistance have been identified in several types of human cancer. However, the possibility that cancer cells may also evade treatment by co-opting physiologically regulated receptors has not been addressed. Here we demonstrate the first example of this alternate mechanism in brain tumors by showing that EGFR-mutant glioblastomas (GBMs) evade EGFR TKIs by transcriptionally de-repressing PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that EGFRvIII signaling actively suppresses PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 transcription in an mTORC1 and ERK-dependent manner. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of oncogenic EGFR renders GBMs dependent on the consequently de-repressed PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 signaling for growth and survival. Importantly, combined inhibition of EGFR and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 signaling potently suppresses tumor growth in vivo. These data identify a novel, non-genetic TKI resistance mechanism in brain tumors and provide compelling rationale for combination therapy. Introduction. The epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR, is commonly amplified and/or mutated in many types of solid cancer including a variety of epithelial cancers and glioblastoma (GBM) (1?3). Despite compelling evidence for EGFR addiction in experimental models, the clinical benefit of most EGFR TKIs has been quite limited. Multiple genetic resistance mechanisms enable cancer cells to maintain signal flux to critical downstream effector pathways, and thus evade EGFR-targeted therapy, including: 1) acquisition and/or selection for secondary EGFR mutations conferring EGFR TKI-resistance (4); 2) additional activating mutations in downstream effectors like PTEN (2), PIK3CA (5) or KRAS (6), and 3) co-occurrence of other amplified or mutated RTKs, including C-MET and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 (7, 8). In addition to these genetic resistance-promoting mutations, it is suspected that EGFR-dependent cancers may escape targeted therapy by developing dependence on other non-amplified, non-mutated RTKs (9). However, the mechanisms by which cancers, including GBM, evade EGFR TKI treatment by co-opting other physiologically regulated receptors has not been addressed. Herein, we integrate studies in cell lines, patient-derived tumor cultures, xenotransplants, and tumor tissue from GBM patients in a phase II clinical trial to provide the first demonstration of EGFR TKI resistance mediated by transcriptional de-repression of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2. We show that the persistently active EGFR mutation, EGFRvIII, suppresses PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression via mTORC1 and ERK-dependent mechanisms. We demonstrate in cells, mice, and patients that EGFR TKI treatment de-represses PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 rendering GBMs dependent on PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 signaling for growth. We further show that combined abrogation of EGFRvIII and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 potently prevents GBM growth in vivo. These results identify a novel physiological EGFR-TKI resistance mechanism in GBM and suggest a clinically actionable approach to suppress it. Results. EGFR inhibition promotes PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 upregulation in glioma. To better understand how malignant glioma acquires resistance to EGFR inhibitors in vivo, U87 glioma cells expressing the EGFRvIII gain-of-function mutation (designated U87-EGFRvIII herein) were placed in the flank of SCID mice. EGFRvIII, the most common EGFR mutation in GBM, arises from an in-frame genomic deletion of exons 2?7, resulting in a persistently active, highly oncogenic protein (10). Tumor bearing mice were gavaged with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib (150mg/kg) or vehicle control and tumor growth assessed over 18 days (Fig. 1a). As expected, erlotinib treatment slowed U87-EGFRvIII tumor growth relative to control, however tumors retained a significant growth rate despite continued erlotinib treatment (Fig. 1b). Immunoblots of tumor lysates confirmed that erlotinib treatment of mice significantly reduced EGFR signaling in xenografts to a level comparable to that of U87 tumor cells expressing kinase-dead EGFR-VIII (Fig. 1c). Thus, U87-EGFRvIII expressing tumors maintain growth despite a significant reduction in EGFR activity when treated with erlotinib; phenocopying the results observed in human trials (2). We considered the possibility that erlotinib-treated U87-EGFRvIII tumors maintain growth by acquiring neo-receptor tyrosine kinase activity. To directly address this, we performed a phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array on control and erlotinib-treated tumor lysates. As expected, control U87-EGFRvIII tumors expressed significant levels of phospho-EGFR that were reduced in erlotinib treated mice (Fig. 1d). Erlotinib treated U87-EGFRvIII tumors also had considerable phospho-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 activity (Fig. 1d). Heightened activation of the tumor suppressor AXL was also noted, albeit it to a lesser extent than PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2. Immunoblots of tumor lysates confirmed upregulation and activation of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 in response to pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of EGFRvIII (Fig. 1c). Parental U87 tumors expressed significant PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 (Fig. 1c), which was suppressed by EGFRvIII. Further, erlotinib treatment markedly upregulated PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression in orthotopic U87-EGFRvIII GBM xenografts (Fig. 1e), suggesting that EGFRvIII signaling actively represses PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2. To determine if the reciprocal relationship could be extended into other patient-derived glioma models endogenously expressing EGFRvIII, or high levels of wild-type EGFR, we examined phospho-EGFR and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression in a panel of low passage patient-derived GBM neurospheres (11). Uniformly, erlotinib treatment resulted in upregulation PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression in EGFRvIII expressing GBM neurospheres, as well as GBM neurospheres expressing high levels of EGFR (Fig. 1f). Additionally, GBM39 cells that developed erlotinib resistance in long-term culture maintained suppression of EGFR phosphorylation and concomitant PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 upregulation (Fig. S1a). Of note and in contrast to PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2, erlotinib treatment had no effect on PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 expression. To assess whether erlotinib treatment similarly elevated PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 levels in GBMs endogenously expressing EGFRvIII in vivo, we examined PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression up to 10 days of treatment with erlotinib at 150mg/kg. Consistent with our proposed model, erlotinib treatment resulted in elevated phosphorylated and total levels of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 (Fig. 1g and S1b). SNP array analysis demonstrated that PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 was not amplified in these tumor cells, either at baseline or after erlotinib treatment (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that EGFRvIII/EGFR signaling negatively regulates PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression in glioma models, and that inhibition of EGFRvIII/EGFR signaling results in upregulation of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2. An RTK switch to PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 occurs in Lapatinib treated patients. Intratumoral heterogeneity of RTK expression is a common feature of malignant gliomas, but it remains unclear if this heterogeneity reflects co-amplification of RTKs within a given tumor cell or differences in RTK expression amongst tumor cells. To distinguish between these possibilities we examined glioma tissue microarrays (TMA) for EGFR and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression. Similar to our model system studies, we observed a strong inverse correlation between EGFR (total and phosphorylated tyrosine 1086) and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression in patient glioma tissues (Fig. 2a, p=0.02). To determine if RTK expression was fixed within a given tumor, we utilized patient tissues from a cohort of patients enrolled in a biopsy-treat-biopsy study where patients underwent seven to ten days oral treatment with another EGFR TKI, lapatinib, as part of a phase II clinical trial (12). Post-lapatinib biopsy samples were divided into EGFR-on and EGFR-off groups following immunoblot analysis and demonstrate striking inverse correlation between phospho-EGFR status and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 protein expression (Fig. 2b, p=0.04). IHC analysis of one patient was available before and after lapatinib treatment, and demonstrated significant reduction of phospho-EGFR after treatment, with concomitant PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression in the tumor (Fig. 2c). These clinical data support a model where highly active EGFR signaling negatively regulates PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression in primary brain tumors, and indicates that pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR signaling results in an RTK switch to PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2. Suppression of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression is dependent on the AKT/ mTOR signaling pathway. EGFRvIII, and to a lesser extent wild-type EGFR, have been shown to potently activate PI3K signaling in GBM, resulting in phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream effector mTORC1 (12?17). Therefore, we set out to determine whether EGFRvIII suppresses PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 through AKT and mTORC1 signaling. To examine whether EGFRvIII suppresses PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 through AKT, U87-EGFRvIII cells were transfected with the constitutively active AKT1 E17K allele (18). Ectopic expression of AKT1 E17K fully abrogated the upregulation of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 in response to erlotinib, confirming that EGFRvIII suppresses PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 through AKT (Fig. 3a). Previous work has identified mTOR as a negative regulator of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (19), leading us to hypothesize that EGFRvIII signaling to AKT suppresses PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression through mTORC1. To test this, we determined PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression in U87-EGFRvIII cells transiently transfected with siRNA targeting the mTORC proteins, Raptor and Rictor. Immunoblot analysis of U87-EGFRvIII cells transiently transfected with siRNA targeting the mTORC proteins, Raptor and Rictor, indicated that inhibition of mTORC1, and to a lesser extent mTORC2, led to increased levels of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression (Fig. 3b). Conversely, transfection of a constitutively active mTOR (S2215Y) allele (20) abrogated erlotinib-dependent upregulation of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 (Fig. 3c). Further, genetic depletion of the mTORC1 effector p70 S6Kinase by siRNA knockdown similarly upregulated PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 (Fig. 3d). Confirming mTOR-dependent repression of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2, rapamycin robustly upregulated PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 protein expression in GBM cell lines in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3e, f). These results demonstrate that EGFR signals through AKT and mTORC1 to suppress PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2. EGFR signaling represses transcription of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 gene. Next, we sought to determine if the influence of mTOR signaling on PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression was regulated at the transcriptional level. To that end, U87-EGFRVIII cells were treated with erlotinib or vehicle, and mRNA was collected up to 36 hours after treatment. RT-qPCR demonstrated that PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 mRNA was upregulated by 8 hours after the addition of erlotinib, and expression progressively increased over a 24 h period (fig. 4a, p<0.001). To determine if the increase in PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression was a function of increased transcription at the PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 gene locus, we assessed the expression levels of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 primary transcripts. RT-qPCR studies revealed that the expression pattern of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 primary transcript mirrored that of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 mRNA following EGFR inhibition (fig. 4a, p<0.001). Treatment and washout studies revealed that PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 primary transcript was dynamically regulated by the addition or removal of erlotinib, further suggesting that expression of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 is an active transcriptional process (Fig. 4b). Correspondingly, transcriptional reporter studies using the PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 promoter upstream of luciferase indicated that knockdown of EGFR or Raptor significantly increased luciferase activity in U87-EGFRvIII cells (Fig. 4c, p<0.001). Lastly, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that rapamycin (5nM) treatment results in recruitment of RNA Polymerase II to both the transcriptional start site and exon 1 of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 (Fig. 4d, p<0.01). Taken together, these studies support a model where EGFR signaling dynamically regulates transcription of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 in an mTOR-dependent manner. However we cannot rule out the possibility that additional factors such as increased stability of the PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 mRNA pool or heightened translation also contribute to PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 upregulation. ERK signaling contributes to the regulation of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2. The MAPK pathway is also activated by EGFRvIII signaling (Fig. 5a), thus we investigated whether the MAPK signaling pathway also contributes to the regulation of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression. The MEK inhibitor U0126 upregulated PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 expression, although to a lesser extent than erlotinib (Fig. 5a), which was not abrogated by over expression of wild type S6K1 or constitutively active S6K1 or S6K1 and S6K2 alleles (Fig. 5b). Taken together, these results demonstrate the presence of a parallel pathway by which EGFRvIII/EGFR signaling regulates PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 through a MAPK (Fig. 5c). Other RTKs such as MET have been shown to engage PI3K signaling to confer resistance to erlotinib in GBM (7). Therefore, we asked whether MET signaling, which can activate both AKT/mTORC1 and MAPK pathways, could similarly promote PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 upregulation. In U87-EGFRvIII or GBM-39 neurospheres, the MET inhibitor PHA-665752 (PHA, 0.05?4\u00a5\u00ecM) was not sufficient to promote PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 upregulation like erlotinib (Fig. 5d, e). However, addition of exogenous HGF ligand promoted AKT and ERK phosphorylation and suppressed erlotinib-mediated upregulation of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5f). These results suggest that HGF-mediated activation of MET can also repress PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 by engaging AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling. PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 is dispensable for EGFRvIII-driven GBM growth, but becomes required for the growth of EGFRvIII-inhibited tumors. Next, we asked if PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 signaling influences proliferative capacity in EGFR-inhibited glioma. To that end, U87-EGFRvIII cells were cultured with erlotinib or vehicle and PDGFbb (0?20ng/mL/day) for 4 days. The addition of PDGFR ligand to untreated U87-EGFRvIII cells had little effect on proliferative capacity (Fig. 6a). As expected, treating U87-EGFRvIII cells with erlotinib alone significantly reduced both EGFR signaling (Fig. S2a) and proliferation (Fig. 6a). The addition of PDGFbb to cultures restored proliferative capacity of erlotinib treated cells (Fig. 2a) in a receptor-specific (Fig. S2b) and dose-dependent manner (Fig S2, c). Similarly, addition of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 ligand to cultures signifcantly restored proliferative capacity of U87-EGFRvIII cells transfected with siRNA targeteing EGFRvIII (Fig. 6b and S2d). Next, we asked whether PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 signaling was required for tumor growth in vivo in GBM cells expressing EGFRvIII, and whether abrogation of EGFRvIII rendered these tumor cells PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2-dependent. To that end, U87-EGFRvIII and U87-EGFRvIII-kinase dead cells were stably transduced with shRNAs targeting PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 or control shRNA and implanted in flanks of SCID mice. Consistent with our in vitro studies, silencing of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 had little effect on U87-EGFRvIII tumor growth (Fig. 6c). In contrast, silencing PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 significantly attenuated the growth of tumors expressing kinase dead-EGFRvIII (Fig. 6d). Immunoblots of xenograft lysates confirmed a relationship between PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 and EGFR activation in tumors (Fig. 6e). To determine whether PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 signaling could abrogate the growth inhibitory effects of erlotinib in GBM cells endogenously expressing EGFRvIII or high levels of wild-type EGFR, we examined the effect of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 signaling on the proliferative capacity on patient-derived GBM neurospheres. The PDGFR kinase inhibitor AG1295 (2\u00a5\u00ecM) alone had no anti-proliferative effect on GBM39 (EGFRvIII positive, PTEN intact), or HK250 (high level wild-type EGFR, PTEN deficient) cells (Fig. 6f, g). In contrast, in the presence of erlotinib, addition of the PDGFR kinase inhibitor AG1295 significantly suppressed tumor cell proliferation (Fig. 6f, g, p<0.01). Of note, and in contrast to our studies on U87-EGFRvIII engineered cells, the patient-derived neurosphere cultures did not require the addition of exogenous PDGFR ligand, consistent with the role of autocrine and paracrine PDGF signaling in GBM (21, 22). Taken together, these data suggest a physiologic RTK switch to the PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 to maintain the growth of EGFRvIII/EGFR-activated GBMs in response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Fig. 7). Discussion. Acquired drug resistance presents a significant challenge for personalized cancer therapy. In principle, upfront sequencing may guide successful combination TKI therapy by defining both the drugable kinase mutations, and the potential \u00a1\u00b0seeds\u00a1\u00b1 of resistance - second site mutations, downstream effector mutations and co-amplification of multiple RTKs. However, non-genetic adaptive resistance mechanisms complicate this paradigm. Identifying the ways that cancer cells \u00a1\u00b0rewire\u00a1\u00b1 their circuitry through pathway cross talk and release of inhibitory feedback loops to evade treatment may be critical for developing more successful combination approaches. By integrating studies of cells, mice, and tumor tissue from patients treated with EGFR inhibitors in a clinical trial, we provide the first experimental evidence that EGFR TKI resistance can be mediated by transcriptional de-repression of another, physiologically regulated RTK: PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2. TKI-mediated release of inhibitory feedback loops is emerging as a frequent, non-genetic mechanism of targeted cancer drug resistance. In colorectal cancer cells bearing the BRAF v600E mutation, resistance to the BRAF inhibitor PLX-4032 (vemurafenib) is mediated by reactivation of EGFR signaling through the MAPK pathway (23, 24), although upregulation of EGFR itself does not appear to be involved. In breast cancer cells, AKT and mTOR inhibition reactivates PI3K signaling through release of an inhibitory feedback loop in a process that appears to involve multiple RTKs (25, 26). Most recently, transcriptional upregulation of the RTK AXL has been shown to promote erlotinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (9), although the mechanism underlying AXL up-regulation is not known. It is interesting to note that we too observed AXL upregulation in response to erlotinib treatment (Fig. 1), suggesting that it may also play a role in mediating erlotinib resistance in GBM. However, we focused on PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 because of the dominance of its signal across all in vitro and in vivo models and in all patient samples we studied. In contrast to the recognized importance of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 alterations (7, 27?29), the role of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 in malignant gliomas has not been as clearly defined. PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 amplifications and/or mutations are exceedingly rare events in GBM (27). In mouse genetic models, PDGF-B ligand overexpression can promote gliomagenesis by enhancing cellular proliferation (30?34). Recently, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 has been shown to promote glioma stem cell self-renewal, suggesting a more definitive role in tumorigenesis and/or maintenance (35). In addition, a PDGF signaling class of GBMs, characterized by PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 phosphorylation and lack of EGFR signaling, amongst other features, has been identified (36). Yet the contribution of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 signaling to drug resistance remains incompletely understood. Here, we provide the first demonstration that mTORC1 inhibition mediates EGFR-TKI resistance in GBM through transcriptional regulation of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2, a mechanism which could also be active in other cancer types. PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 has been shown to mediate vemurafenib resistance through transcriptional upregulation in melanoma (37). However, the mechanism underlying this event is not known. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 was shown to be a target of mTOR-dependent negative transcriptional downregulation (19). However, its role in mediating EGFR and or mTOR TKI resistance has not previously been recognized. In addition, we identify a parallel pathway (38) by which ERK signaling also suppresses PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2. Our data definitively demonstrate that EGFR inhibitors de-repress PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 transcription, providing a potent mechanism underlying RTK switching. These findings have broad implications for understanding acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, and potentially mTOR inhibitors as well, across multiple cancer types. Future studies will be necessary in order to address this possibility more fully. In addition, future studies will be needed to identify the transcriptional machinery linking mTOR/S6K with PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2. EGFR amplification and mutation presents perhaps the most compelling drugable target in GBM. Genetic and/or functional PTEN loss (2, 39); co-occurrence of c-MET and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 gene amplification (7, 28, 29), and pharmacokinetic considerations (40) all contribute to EGFR TKI resistance, indicating a broad repertoire of resistance mechanisms that can be co-targeted. However, the role of non-genetic \u00a1\u00b0rewiring\u00a1\u00b1 in mediating drug resistance remains to be defined. Here, we have identified a transcriptional repressive mechanism by which EGFRvIII regulates PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2; shown that EGFR-inhibited GBMs become PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2-dependent for survival through mTOR-dependent transcriptional de-repression; and demonstrated that abrogation of EGFRvIII and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 stop tumor growth, providing strong rationale for combination therapy. These results provide the first clinical and biological evidence for the concept of RTK \u00a1\u00b0switching\u00a1\u00b1 as an EGFR TKI resistance mechanism in GBM, and provide a molecular explanation of how tumors can become \u00a1\u00b0addicted\u00a1\u00b1 to a non-amplified, non-mutated, physiologically regulated RTK to evade targeted treatment. Methods. Cell lines and media. U87 and isogenic U87-EGFRvIII, U87-EGFRvIII kinase dead, U87-EGFRvIII/shPDGFRB, U87-EGFRvIII kinase dead shPDGFRB cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco\u00a1\u00afs modified Eagle\u00a1\u00afs medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% FBS (Omega Scientific) and PSQ (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. U87-EGFRvIII kinase dead cells were a gift of W. Cavenee. U87-EGFRvIII-shPDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 cells were generated by plasmid-mediated transfection of shPDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 into U87-EGFRvIII cells followed by selection for stable clones. Neurosphere cell lines (GBM6, GBM12, GBM39, HK296, HK242, HK250) were cultured in Dulbecco\u00a1\u00afs modified Eagle\u00a1\u00afs medium F12 (Cellgro) supplemented with EGF, FGF, Heparin (Sigma), Glutamax, and PSQ (Invitrogen). Long-term erlotinib-resistant GBM39 neurospheres were cultured in the presence of erlotinib for 30 days until cells were resistant. U87 cells were obtained from ATCC, and engineered to express EGFRvIII in the Mischel laboratory. GBM6, GBM12, GBM39 were obtained from coauthor Dr. David James at UCSF and authenticated by DNA fingerprinting. HK296, HK242, HK250 were obtained by Dr. Harley Kornblum and authenticated by immunoblot studies. Xenograft models. Isogenic human malignant glioma cells were implanted into immunodeficient SCID/Beige mice for subcutaneous xenograft studies as follows. SCID/Beige mice were bred and kept under defined-flora pathogen-free conditions at the Association for Assessment of Laboratory Animal Care?approved Animal Facility of the Division of Experimental Radiation Oncology, UCLA. For subcutaneous implantation of U87 tumor cells (or indicated isogenic U87-EGFRvIII, U87-EGFRvIII kinase dead, U87-EGFRvIII/shPDGFRB, U87-EGFRvIII kinase dead shPDGFRB) or GBM39 xenografts, Single cell suspensions and injected subcutaneously at 600 thousand cells/150ul in a solution of Dulbecco\u00a1\u00afs phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS) and Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Tumor growth was monitored with calipers by measuring the perpendicular diameter of each subcutaneous tumor. For intracranial xenograft studies, U251 cells were injected intracranially in rats as described previously (41). Rapamycin was administered for three days at 2mg/kg/day. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Animal Research Committee of UCLA. Cell proliferation assays. Absolute viable cell counts were determined by trypan blue exclusion and counted on a hemocytometer. Relative cell proliferation was determined using Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Chemicon), per manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs specifications. Briefly, cells were incubated 1.5 hours (5% CO 2, 37degrees) after addition of tetrazolium salt WST-1 [2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfo-phenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt] and the absorbance was then measured in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at 450 nm with a background reading at 650nm subtracted. For assays using erlotinib or AG1295, small molecules or DMSO vehicle were added at the indicated doses on day 0 of assays. In assays with PDGFbb ligand, cultures were stimulated daily with PDGFbb ligand at 20ng/ml for the indicated days. Neurospheres were plated in laminin-coated 96-well dishes in neurobasal media supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS (Omega scientific) and treated with indicated drug as above. For transient siRNA knockdown of EGFRvIII, cells were incubated overnight with transient siRNA of EGFRvIII (Ambion) or scrambled SiRNA (Ambion) at 10nM with RNAiMax Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) and Optimem (Invitrogen). Cells were then plated in 12 well plates and were stimulated with PDGF-bb ligand or vehicle in medium containing 2% charcoal-stripped FBS (Omega scientific) and counted as above. Knockdown studies. Transient knockdown of EGFRvIII, S6K1, Raptor, and Rictor (Ambion) were performed as follows. siRNA was diluted to a final concentration of 10nM in Optimem and 7.5 ul Lipofectamine RNAi-max, in serum-containing, PSQ-free media overnight in a final volume of six mLs in a 60mm dish. Media was changed the following morning, and cells were incubated for 24 hours before lysate collection. For the generation of stable knockdown cell lines, cells (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4) were seeded in 12-well plates and maintained for 24 hours, after which the medium was replaced with fresh 5% FBS medium including polybrene (5 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml; Sigma), and shRNA lentivirus was added to cells followed by incubation for 24 hours. Transient transfection. Plasmids used were pcDNA control, wildtype mTOR, mTOR S2215Y, and AKT E17K (mTOR constructs were a gift from Fuyu Tamanoi, E17K was a gift from Ingo Mellinghoff, pcDNA control was from Addgene). Empty vector, mTOR constructs, and AKT E17K were diluted to 2500ng in optimem and incubated with Lipofectamine PLUS and LTX reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Cells were plated in 5 mL of 5% FBS and 1mL of optimem/plasmid/Lipofectamine was added to each plate. Media was changed the next day to serum-free media and cells were incubated with erlotinib for 24 hours before lysates were collected. For S6 kinase wildtype and constitutively active forms, plasmids were diluted to 16ug in optimem and incubated with Fugene6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Cells were plated in 5mLs 10% FBS and 1mL of optimem/plasmid/Fugene6 was added to each plate. The media was changed to serum-free media the following morning and cells were incubated with U0126 for 24 hours. Lysates were then collected for immunoblotting. Plasmids used were pcDNA control, EES6K1 and T412D/T401D S6K1/2 (S6 kinase plasmids were a gift from Ivan Gout) Immunoblots. Cultured cells or snap-frozen tissue samples were lysed and homogenized with RIPA buffer (buffer, Boston Bioproducts; protease and phosphatase inhibitor, Thermoscientific). Protein concentration was determined via BCA Assay (reagents A and B, Thermoscientific; standards, Biorad) and samples were subjected to 4?12% gradient SDS?polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membrane was then probed with indicated primary antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The immunoreactivity was revealed by use of an ECL kit (Thermoscientific). Antibodies used in the study include p-EGFR 1086 (Epitomics), p-EGFR 1068, p-AKT 473, p-AKT T308, AKT, p-S6 Ser235/236, p-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 Y751, p-ERK T202/Y204, ERK, p-Met Y1234, p-S6K1 T389, S6K1, PathScan cocktail, p-NDRG1 T346, \u00a5\u00e2-actin, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 (Cell Signaling), \u00a5\u00e1-tubulin (Sigma); EGFR (Upstate). Immunohistochemistry. Xenografts were excised from mice treated with vehicle or erlotinib as described above. A portion of the tumor was fixed in paraformaldehyde and ethanol and sent to the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at UCLA tissue core for slicing and staining as required. Phospho-RTK array. U87-EGFRvIII tumors from vehicle or erlotinib treated mice were harvested, and homogenized in NP40 containing lysis buffer, then loaded at 2000 micrograms per RTK array membrane, according to the manufacture\u00a1\u00afs instructions (R&D systems). For U87-EGFRvIII cells in culture, lysates were generated and loaded on RTK array as described above. Pilot study of lapatinib. North American Brain Tumor Consortium (NABTC) trial 04-01 titled \u00a1\u00b0A biomarker and Phase II study of GW 572016 (lapatinib) in recurrent malignant glioma\u00a1\u00b1 enrolled consented patients from University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California at San Francisco, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh, Neuro-oncology branch of National Institutes of Health, University of Wisconsin, and Duke University (12). Adult patients who had a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) equal to or greater than 60, who were not on enzyme-inducing antiepileptic agents and who had normal hematologic, metabolic, and cardiac function were eligible for this study. In addition, patients must have been candidates for surgical re-resection at the time of enrollment. Patients were administered 750 mg of lapatinib orally twice a day (BID) for 7 to10 days (depending on whether treatment interval fell over a weekend) before surgery, the time to steady state. Blood and tissue samples were obtained at the time of resection. After recovery from surgery, patients resumed lapatinib treatment at the neoadjuvant dose of 750 mg BID until clinical or radiographic evidence for tumor progression was found. The first cohort of patients for whom tissue was available before and after lapatinib (n = 10) were included in this study. Tissue Microarrays. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were used to analyze PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 and p-EGFR Tyr 1086 immunohistochemical staining in 140 GBM patient samples. Two GBM TMAs were constructed with a 0.6-mm needle to extract 252 representative tumor tissue cores and 91 adjacent normal brain tissue cores from the paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of 140 primary GBM patients (12). These cores were placed in a grid pattern into two recipient paraffin blocks, from which tissue sections were cut for immunohistochemical analysis of p-EGFR Y1086 and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2. EGFR and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 staining was scored and tabulated in Chi-square. Realtime-PCR. In vitro, U87EGFRvIII cells were incubated in serum-free media with and without erlotinib for 32 hours, as well as in 10% serum with and without rapamycin for 24 hours. At each time point, cells were lysed in Trizol for RNA extraction. RT-PCR analysis was conducted using primers designed to amplify either the primary transcript of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 as well as the messenger RNA transcript. Primer sequences for PDGFRB mRNA are forward AGGACACGCAGGAGGTCAT and reverse TTCTGCCAAAGCATGATGAG. Primer sequences for PDGFRB primary transcripts are forward CATCTGCAAAACCACCATTG and reverse ACTTGCCTCTGCTGAGCATC. For the washout, U87EGFRvIII cells were plated in 10%FBS containing media. The media was changed to serum-free media and erlotinib (5uM) was added at t = 0h. Media was changed at 24 h, and erlotinib (5uM) was added again at 48h. At each time point, cells were lysed in Trizol for RNA extraction as described above. mRNA and primary transcripts were normalized against 36B4. Luciferase Assay. U87-EGFRvIII cells were transfected with Switchgear genomics PDGF\u00a5\u00e2R promoter plasmid concurrently with control CMV plasmid promoter Luciferase and Renilla and Firefly Luciferase control. Luciferase assay was conducted using Promega Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed in U87-EGFRvIII cells with or without rapamycin (5nM) for 24 hours. Cells in two 15-cm plates were pooled for each replicate. ChIP was performed as previously described (42) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were cross-linked for 5 min in 1% formaldehyde in PBS. After sonication (15 min total sonication time in 30-s pulses), soluble chromatin from each replicate was split four ways for overnight immunoprecipitations with 2 ug of the following antibodies: mouse immunoglobulin G (Millipore cat #12-371) antibody against polymerase II (Millipore clone CTD4H3, cat #05-623, positive control). 5ul of chromatin was used as control. DNA-protein complexes were pulled down by incubation for 2 hours with protein G-Sepharose, washed, and eluted with 1% SDS buffer. Resulting chromatin was de-crosslinked with heat and protein digested with Proteinase K, along with input controls. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers amplifying PDGFR TSS and a fragment upstream of the TSS. qPCR values were normalized against the input gDNA content for each replicate. qPCR primers are available upon request. ERK and Met studies. For treatment with erlotinib and the MEK inhibitor U0126 or the Met inhibitor PHA 665752, adherent cells were plated in 10% FBS. GBM39 cells were plated on plates coated with laminin (Sigma) as described above in complete neurosphere media. The following day, media was changed to serum-free media (U0126), 2% FBS-containing media (U87EGFRvIII, PHA 665752), or DMEM/F12 (GBM39, PHA 665752). Cells were then incubated with drug for 24 hours before being lysed for immunoblot analysis. For HGF stimulation, U87-EGFRvIII cells were plated as described above. Media was changed to serum-free media, and HGF was added at 50 or 100ng/mL concurrently with DMSO vehicle or erlotinib (5\u00a5\u00ecM) 24 hours prior to collection. Cells were stimulated again 4 hours prior to collection. Statistical Analysis. Fisher\u00a1\u00afs exact test was used to assess correlation between EGFR and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 in clinical samples. All other comparisons of cell proliferation, transcript level, and tumor volume were performed using one-way or two way ANOVA with a Tukey HSD test as required. All results are shown as means +/? SD. Significance. These results provide the first clinical and biological evidence for receptor tyrosine kinase \u00a1\u00b0switching\u00a1\u00b1 as a mechanism of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in glioblastoma, and provide a molecular explanation of how tumors can become \u00a1\u00b0addicted\u00a1\u00b1 to a non-amplified, non-mutated, physiologically regulated receptor tyrosine kinase to evade targeted treatment.

                "text": "mTOR Inhibitors Control the Growth of EGFR Mutant Lung Cancer Even after Acquiring Resistance by HGF\tResistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), gefitinib and erlotinib, is a critical problem in the treatment of EGFR mutant lung cancer. Several mechanisms, including bypass signaling by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-triggered Met activation, are implicated as mediators of resistance. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is a downstream conduit of EGFR and MET signaling, and is thus considered a therapeutically attractive target in the treatment of various types of cancers. The purpose of this study was to examine whether 2 clinically approved mTOR inhibitors, temsirolimus and everolimus, overcome HGF-dependent resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. Both temsirolimus and everolimus inhibited the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1, which are downstream targets of the mTOR pathway, and reduced the viability of EGFR mutant lung cancer cells, PC-9, and HCC827, even in the presence of HGF in vitro. In a xenograft model, temsirolimus suppressed the growth of PC-9 cells overexpressing the HGF-gene; this was associated with suppression of the mTOR signaling pathway and tumor angiogenesis. In contrast, erlotinib did not suppress this signaling pathway or tumor growth. Multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor production by tumor cells and suppression of endothelial cell viability, contribute to the anti-angiogenic effect of temsirolimus. These findings indicate that mTOR inhibitors may be useful for controlling HGF-triggered EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer, and they provide the rationale for clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors in patients stratified by EGFR mutation and HGF expression status. Introduction. Lung cancer is the leading cause of malignancy-related death worldwide, and more than 80% of cases are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations, such as exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R point mutation, are found in a population of NSCLC, and are associated with a clinical response to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGF-TKIs), gefitinib and erlotinib [1]?[3]. However, almost all responders acquire resistance and develop recurrence after varying periods of time (acquired resistance) [4]. In addition, 20?30% of the patients show unfavorable responses, although their tumors have target mutations (intrinsic resistance) [5]. Many studies have been performed in order to delineate strategies that may overcome acquired and intrinsic resistance. These studies have identified several mechanisms of acquired resistance, including EGFR T790M mutation [6], [7], MET amplification [8], [9], hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) overexpression [10], loss of PTEN [11], transformation to a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) phenotype [12]?[14], epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [15]?[17], activation of the NFkB pathway [18], alteration of microRNA [19], and Gas6-Axl axis activation [20]. The complexity of NSCLC is reflected by the co-occurrence of various combinations of these resistance mechanisms in different individuals. We previously discovered that HGF triggers EGFR-TKI resistance by activating the MET/PI3K/AKT axis [10]. Furthermore, we showed that HGF overexpression is present in tumors from Japanese patients with acquired and intrinsic tumor resistance to EGFR-TKI at frequencies of about 60% and 30%, respectively [21]. This indicates that HGF is an ideal target for overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer patients. To overcome HGF-triggered resistance, 2 signals from EGFR and HGF-MET should be blocked simultaneously. We already reported that HGF-dependent resistance can be controlled by an anti-HGF neutralizing antibody [22], the HGF antagonist NK4 [22], MET-TKI [23]?[25], and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors [26] in combination with EGFR-TKI. However, these inhibitors are not clinically approved and therefore cannot be used for treatment of cancer patients. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase, is a downstream target of the PI3K and AKT pathways, and it plays a critical role in cell survival and proliferation [27]?[29]. Activation of PI3K/AKT and subsequent phosphorylation of mTOR initiates the phosphorylation of important downstream targets, including ribosomal p70S6 serine/threonine kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor (EIF)-4E binding protein (4E-BP1), resulting in an increase in mRNA translation and cap-dependent protein synthesis, respectively. Thus, mTOR kinase is a key node of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [27]?[30]. To date, several mTOR inhibitor rapamycin analogs have been developed, including temsirolimus and everolimus, which have been used to treat renal cell carcinomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Rapamycin and its analogs bind FK506-binding protein-12 (FKBP12) and interact with mTOR, inhibiting its kinase activities and halting the translation of proteins critical for cell proliferation and survival. Because mTOR is downstream of both EGFR and MET, we hypothesized that mTOR inhibition, even as a monotherapy agent, may block EGFR- and MET-mediated signaling simultaneously and overcome HGF-triggered EGFR-TKI resistance. In the present study, we examined whether the clinically approved mTOR inhibitors, temsirolimus and everolimus, circumvent HGF-triggered EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells using in vitro and in vivo models, and assessed underlying mechanisms. Materials and Methods. Cell cultures and reagents. EGFR mutant human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines PC-9 (del E746_A750) and HCC827, with deletions in EGFR exon 19, were purchased from Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co. (Takasaki, Gunma, Japan) and the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), respectively. Human HGF-gene transfectants (PC-9/HGF) and vector control (PC-9/Vec) cells were established as previously described [10]. All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. All cells were passaged for less than 3 months before renewal from frozen, early-passage stocks. Cells were regularly screened for mycoplasma by using MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kits (Lonza, Rockland, ME). The cell lines were authenticated at the laboratory of the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation (Osaka, Japan) by short tandem repeat analysis. Erlotinib, everolimus, and temsirolimus were obtained from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX). Human recombinant HGF was prepared as previously described [10]. Production of HGF and VEGF in cell culture supernatants. Cells (2\u00a1\u00bf10 5) were cultured in 2 mL medium with 10% FBS for 24 h, washed with PBS and incubated for 48 h in medium with 10% FBS. In some experiments, HGF was added to the medium. The culture media were harvested and centrifuged, and the supernatants were stored at ?70\u00a1\u00c6C until analysis. The concentrations of HGF and VEGF were determined by IMMUNIS HGF EIA (Institute of Immunology, Tokyo, Japan) and Quantikine VEGF ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), respectively, according to the manufacturers' protocols. All samples were run in duplicate. Color intensity was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometric plate reader. Growth factor concentrations were determined by comparison with standard curves. The detection limits for HGF and VEGF were 100 pg/mL and 31 pg/mL, respectively. Cell viability assay. Cell viability was measured by the MTT dye reduction method. Tumor cells, plated at 2\u00a1\u00bf10 3/100 \u00a5\u00ecL RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% FBS/well in 96-well plates, were incubated for 24 h. Then, erlotinib, temsirolimus, everolimus, and/or HGF were added to each well, and incubation was continued for an additional 72 h. Cell viability was measured with MTT solution (2 mg/mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), as previously described [10]. Each experiment was performed with triplicate samples. Antibodies and western blotting. Protein aliquots (25 \u00a5\u00ecg each) were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). After washing 4 times, the membranes were incubated with Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) for 1 h at room temperature (RT) and overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C with primary antibodies to \u00a5\u00e2-actin (13E5), Met (25H2), phospho-MET (anti-p-MET, Y1234/Y1235; 3D7), p-EGFR (Y1068), AKT or p-AKT (S473), mTOR, p-mTOR (S2448), p70S6K, pp70S6K (T389), 4E-BP1, p4E-BP1(T37/46) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), human EGFR (1 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL), human/mouse/rat ERK1/ERK2 (0.2 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL), and p-ERK1/ERK2 (T202/Y204; 0.1 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL) (R&D Systems). After 3 washes, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at RT with species-specific horseradish peroxidase?conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate, an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Xenograft studies in SCID mice. Suspensions of PC-9/Vec and PC-9/HGF cells (5\u00a1\u00bf10 6) were subcutaneously injected into the back of 5-week-old male mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (Clea, Tokyo, Japan). After 7 days, the mice were randomized to no treatment (control group), oral erlotinib (20 mg/kg/day), or intravenous temsirolimus (50 mg/kg/week in water). Tumor size was measured twice a week, and tumor volume was calculated (mm 3) as [(width) 2 \u00a1\u00bf length]/2. All animal experiments complied with the guidelines for the Institute for Experimental Animals, Advanced Science Research Center, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan (approval no. AP-081088). Histological analyses. For the detection of proliferating tumor cells (Ki-67), 5-\u00a5\u00ecm-thick sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol, and antigen-retrieved. For detection of endothelial cells (CD31), 5-\u00a5\u00ecm-thick frozen sections of xenograft tumors were fixed with cold acetone and washed with PBS. Then, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 3% aqueous H 2O 2 for 10 min. Following treatment with 5% normal horse serum, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies to Ki-67 (MIB-1) (Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), and mouse CD31 (MEC13.3) (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ). After probing with species-specific biotinylated secondary antibodies, the sections were incubated for 30 min with avidin?biotinylated peroxidase complex (ABC) using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The DAB (3,3\u00a1\u00c7-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride) Liquid System (Dako Cytomation) was used to detect immunostaining. Omission of primary antibodies served as a negative control. The 5 areas containing the highest numbers of stained cells within a section were selected for histologic quantitation by light or fluorescent microscopy at 400-fold magnification. All results were independently evaluated by 2 two investigators (D.I. and T.N.). Statistical analysis. Between group comparisons were assessed by two-tailed Student's t-tests. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Software. A P value<0.01 was considered statistically significant. Results. mTOR inhibitors suppress viability of EGFR mutant lung cancer cells in the presence of HGF. PC-9 and HCC827 are human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with deletions of exon 19 in EGFR, resulting in constitutive activation of this protein. These cell lines were sensitive to erlotinib, whereas HGF induced erlotinib resistance (Fig. 1). Treatment with either mTOR inhibitor (temsirolimus or everolimus) alone discernibly suppressed the viability of these cell lines. Under these experimental conditions, HGF did not decrease the sensitivity of these cell lines to either drug. These results suggest that mTOR inhibitors may effectively control the growth of EGFR mutant lung cancer cells, irrespective of the presence of HGF which would induce EGFR-TKI resistance. Our previous study demonstrated that, in patients with NSCLC, HGF is primarily detected in cancer cells with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, suggesting that the production of HGF by these cells occurs mainly via an autocrine mechanism. To further explore the effect of mTOR inhibitors on autocrine HGF production, we generated stable HGF-gene transfectants in PC-9 cells (PC-9/HGF). PC-9/HGF cells secreted high concentrations of HGF (28\u00a1\u00be1 ng/48 h), whereas the concentrations of HGF secreted by PC-9- and control vector-transfected PC-9/Vec cells were below the limit of detection. In addition, PC-9/HGF cells became resistant to erlotinib (Fig. 2). We found that temsirolimus or everolimus discernibly reduced the viability of both PC-9/Vec and PC-9/HGF cells to the same extent, whereas the combination of mTOR inhibitor plus erlotinib had no effect in PC-9/Vec cells in the presence of HGF, indicating that the mTOR inhibitors did not further sensitize these cells to erlotinib in vitro (Fig. S1). Knock down of mTOR by siRNA resulted in inhibition of viability of PC-9/Vec and PC-9/HGF cells by 30% (Fig S2 B), indicating that inhibited cell viability by temsirolimus even in the presence of HGF is due to mTOR inhibition. We also performed flow cytometry using Annexin V and found that temsirolimus did not induce discernible apoptosis in PC-9/Vec or PC-9/HGF cells (Fig. S3). These findings indicate that mTOR inhibitors, when used as single agents, suppress growth of EGFR mutant lung cancer cells via inhibition of proliferation rather than induction of apoptosis. mTOR inhibitors suppress p70S6K and 4EBP1 phosphorylation even in the presence of HGF. To explore the molecular mechanism by which mTOR inhibitors suppressed cell viability even in the presence of HGF, we examined the protein expression and phosphorylation status of EGFR, MET, and their downstream molecules (ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT, p70S6K, and 4EBP1) in PC-9/Vec and PC-9/HGF cells by western blotting (Fig. 2D). PC-9/Vec cells expressed EGFR and MET proteins, whereas only EGFR was discernibly phosphorylated. Erlotinib remarkably inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, as well as downstream ERK1/2 and AKT, but it marginally inhibited p70S6K phosphorylation. While neither temsirolimus nor everolimus affected the phosphorylation of EGFR, MET, ERK1/2 or AKT, they inhibited the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP1, the downstream molecules of mTOR. In PC-9/HGF cells, MET was also phosphorylated, presumably due to HGF that was produced in an autocrine manner. Erlotinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but it did not remarkably inhibit the phosphorylation of MET, AKT, p70S6K, or 4EBP1. While neither temsirolimus nor everolimus inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, MET, ERK1/2, or AKT, they markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP1. These results indicate that mTOR inhibitors suppress the phosphorylation of downstream molecules of mTOR, irrespective of the presence of HGF. mTOR inhibition suppresses HGF-induced growth of erlotinib-resistant tumors in vivo. We next evaluated whether mTOR inhibitors would control the growth of EGFR mutant lung cancer cells with HGF-triggered EGFR-TKI-resistance in vivo. Oral administration of erlotinib suppressed the growth of PC-9/Vec-tumors, but not PC-9/HGF tumors, indicating resistance of PC-9/HGF tumors to erlotinib in vivo (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, intravenous administration of temsirolimus suppressed the growth of both PC-9/Vec tumors and PC-9/HGF tumors. These results indicated that mTOR inhibition may be useful for controlling the growth of HGF-induced resistant tumors in vivo. We further assessed the molecular mechanisms by which temsirolimus inhibited the growth of PC-9/HGF-tumors. Western blot analyses revealed that erlotinib markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2, and AKT, and slightly suppressed the phosphorylation of p70S6K in PC-9/Vec-tumors (Fig. 3B). While erlotinib remarkably inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, it only slightly inhibited ERK1/2 and p70S6K phosphorylation, whereas it did not inhibit AKT phosphorylation in PC-9/HGF-tumors. On the other hand, though temsirolimus did not markedly affect the phosphorylation of EGFR or ERK1/2 in both PC-9/Vec tumors and PC-9/HGF tumors, it remarkably inhibited p70S6K phosphorylation, suggesting the mode of action of this drug as a mTOR inhibitor. Interestingly, temsirolimus slightly inhibited the Akt phosphorylation in PC-9/HGF tumors, but it increased AKT phosphorylation in PC-9/HGF cells in vitro condition (Fig. 2D). To clarify the cause of this discrepancy, we examined the time course of mTOR inhibitor treatment on AKT phosphorylation in vivo (Fig S4). We found that in accordance with the results of in vitro experiments, AKT phosphorylation in the tumors was increased 4 h after temsirolimus treatment. But then, the level of AKT phosphorylation was decreased and it was slightly inhibited at 96 h after the treatment, in accordance with the results shown in Fig. 3B. Therefore, the discrepancy of the results between Fig. 2D and Fig. 3B were due to the difference of the timing samples were harvested. mTOR inhibition suppresses angiogenesis in vivo. We also examined tumor cell proliferation (Ki-67) and angiogenesis (CD31) by immunohistochemistry. Erlotinib treatment markedly inhibited tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis in PC-9/Vec xenografts, whereas erlotinib did not affect cell proliferation or angiogenesis significantly in PC-9/HGF xenografts (Fig. 4). In contrast, temsirolimus markedly inhibited cell proliferation and angiogenesis in both PC-9/Vec and PC-9/HGF tumors. These findings suggest that temsirolimus inhibits the growth of PC-9/HGF tumors (at least in part) by inhibiting angiogenesis. To further explore the molecular mechanisms by which temsirolimus inhibited angiogenesis, we examined its effect on tumor cell production of VEGF, a prominent pro-angiogenic molecule. Both PC-9 and PC-9/Vec cells constitutively produced detectable levels of VEGF, which was stimulated by HGF (Fig. 5A). Consistent with these observations, PC-9/HGF cells produced higher levels of VEGF than PC-9 and PC-9/Vec cells. Temsirolimus suppressed VEGF production in these cancer cells in the presence or absence of HGF. Knock down of mTOR by siRNA resulted in inhibition of VEGF production by PC-9/Vec and PC-9/HGF cells, just like temsirolimus treatment (Fig S2). These results indicate that inhibited VEGF production by temsirolimus even in the presence of HGF is due to mTOR inhibition. We also assessed the direct effect of temsirolimus on the viability of endothelial cells in vitro. Temsirolimus did not inhibit constitutive viability of HMVEC cells in the medium with 10% FBS alone (Figure 5B). VEGF and HuMedia-MvG, which contain EGF and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), increased the viability of HMVECs. Temsirolimus, at concentrations of 1 nM and higher, inhibited this increase in viability. These results indicate that temsirolimus inhibits angiogenesis by multiple mechanisms. Discussion. In the present study, we demonstrated that mTOR inhibitors suppressed the growth of EGFR mutant lung cancer cells, even in the presence of HGF, in vitro and in vivo. Our results also indicate that mTOR inhibitors suppress angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF production and endothelial proliferation stimulated with various pro-angiogenic factors. These observations suggest that mTOR inhibitors, as monotherapeutic agents, are useful for controlling the progression of EGFR mutant lung cancer and HGF-triggered resistance to EGFR-TKIs. HGF, also called scatter factor, is a multifunctional cytokine [31]. Recent studies showed that HGF is involved in the carcinogenesis, invasion/motility, EMT, angiogenesis, and metastasis in lung cancer, and it is therefore associated with poor prognosis of patients [32]. We previously reported that HGF induces EGFR-TKI-resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells by restoring MET/PI3K/AKT pathway signaling [10]. HGF Overexpression is involved not only in acquired resistance but also intrinsic resistance to EGFR-TKIs [21]. In addition, HGF stimulates VEGF production by EGFR mutant lung cancer cells, as well as facilitates angiogenesis, thereby promoting tumor progression [24]. HGF overexpression is often co-detected with the EGFR-T790M gatekeeper mutation in acquired resistant tumors [9], [11], [21]. HGF induces resistance to irreversible EGFR-TKIs and mutant EGFR-selective TKIs [33], which were developed to overcome T790M-mediated EGFR-TKI resistance. Recent clinical trials with irreversible TKI monotherapy failed to demonstrate an objective response in EGFR mutant lung cancer patients that were refractory to treatment with the reversible EGFR-TKIs?gefitinib and erlotinib [34]. These findings suggest that co-existence of altered HGF signaling contributes to the unfavorable response to irreversible EGFR-TKIs in these patients [32]. In addition, the presence of HGF accelerates the growth of pre-existing EGFR-TKI-resistant clones that harbor MET amplification [35]. More recently, HGF was reported to induce resistance to ALK selective inhibitors in EML4-ALK lung cancer [36] and BRAF inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma [37]. Such accumulating evidence indicates that HGF is a common target for overcoming resistance to targeted drugs in oncogene-addicted tumors. Our results also suggest that mTOR inhibitors have advantage of several mechanisms to suppress the growth of EGFR-TKI resistance triggered by HGF in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. For example, these inhibitors likely block mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1 survival signals that are usually engaged during PI3K/AKT activation in cancer cells. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway contributes to the survival of EGFR mutant lung cancer cells [38], [39]. We previously reported that this pathway is also crucial for acquiring HGF-triggered resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells [40]. In the present study, both temsirolimus and everolimus partially suppressed the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1, as well as inhibited the survival of EGFR mutant cancer cells in vitro. Thus, mTOR inhibitors achieve growth inhibition by suppressing both survival signals from EGFR and resistance signals from MET in cancer cells. Another possible mechanism is the inhibition of angiogenesis. Recent studies reported that mTOR-mediated signaling stimulates HIF-1\u00a5\u00e1 transcription, which regulates VEGF, via 4E-BP1 phosphorylation [41]. mTOR inhibitors suppress HIF-1\u00a5\u00e1 transcription and thereby inhibit VEGF production [28], [29], [41]?[43]. We previously reported that HGF activates the MET/GAB1 pathway and increases VEGF production by EGFR mutant lung cancer cells [24]. In the present study, we confirmed this finding and further demonstrated that mTOR inhibitors suppressed both constitutive VEGF production and HGF-stimulated VEGF production. Moreover, we found that while mTOR inhibitors did not affect the viability of unstimulated endothelial cells, they inhibited endothelial proliferation stimulated by various pro-angiogenic factors, including VEGF. mTOR is activated following engagement of several receptor tyrosine kinases such as VEGFR-2, EGFR, and FGFR-1 [41]; hence, mTOR inhibitors may abrogate the stimulation caused by multiple pro-angiogenic factors in endothelial cells. Therefore, mTOR inhibitors may suppress angiogenesis by at least 2 modes of actions. First, they may inhibit VEGF production even in the presence of HGF. Second, they may inhibit endothelial cell proliferation that is stimulated by various pro-angiogenic factors. Results of recent clinical trials with targeted drugs indicate the importance of patient selection. For example, the response rate of gefitinib was only 10?20% in unselected NSCLC [44], but it was about 80% in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC [43]. The progression-free survival of EGFR mutant lung cancer patients was also much longer than that of unselected NSCLC patients [45]. While a large number of mTOR inhibitors have been developed and are being evaluated in clinical trials in lung cancer, neither of sirolimus, temsirolimus, or everolimus, when used as monotherapeutic agents, show clinical efficacy in unselected NSCLC [46] [47]. Moreover, recent studies of mTOR inhibitors combined with EGFR-TKI also failed to show clinical benefit in unselected NSCLC [46],[48]?[50]. Our current study is preclinical, and we demonstrated that mTOR inhibitors showed considerable efficacy in lung cancer cells with HGF-mediated resistance to EGFR-TKI resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Dong et al. also reported the anti-tumor activity of mTOR inhibitors against EGFR-TKI-resistant EGFR mutant lung cancer cells with the T790M gatekeeper mutation [51]. Both HGF and T790M gatekeeper mutations are frequently detected in EGFR-TKI resistant tumors, where they contribute to resistance. Therefore, these observations illustrate the necessity of clinical trials with mTOR inhibitors in EGFR mutant lung cancer patients who become refractory to gefitinib and erlotinib. Moreover, since HGF confers resistance to targeted drugs in several tumor types, clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors are warranted. Supporting Information.

                "text": "Targeting MYCN in Neuroblastoma by BET Bromodomain Inhibition\tBromodomain inhibition comprises a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer, particularly for hematologic malignancies. To date, however, genomic biomarkers to direct clinical translation have been lacking. We conducted a cell-based screen of genetically-defined cancer cell lines using a prototypical inhibitor of BET bromodomains. Integration of genetic features with chemosensitivity data revealed a robust correlation between MYCN amplification and sensitivity to bromodomain inhibition. We characterized the mechanistic and translational significance of this finding in neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer with frequent amplification of MYCN. Genome-wide expression analysis demonstrated downregulation of the MYCN transcriptional program accompanied by suppression of MYCN transcription. Functionally, bromodomain-mediated inhibition of MYCN impaired growth and induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma. BRD4 knock-down phenocopied these effects, establishing BET bromodomains as transcriptional regulators of MYCN. BET inhibition conferred a significant survival advantage in three in vivo neuroblastoma models, providing a compelling rationale for developing BET bromodomain inhibitors in patients with neuroblastoma. Introduction. The interplay between master regulatory transcription factors and specific chromatin-associated co-activators is an emerging hallmark of cancer. Cancer genomic discovery efforts continue to reveal mutations in epigenetic modifiers, and laboratory efforts to validate functional dependencies are ongoing (1). Moreover, there are notable examples of successful commercial development of drugs targeting epigenetic modifiers, including the development of inhibitors of enzymatic \u00a1\u00b0writers,\u00a1\u00b1 such as DNA methyltransferases for myelodysplastic syndrome, and inhibitors of enzymatic \u00a1\u00b0erasers,\u00a1\u00b1 such as histone deacetylases for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Modulation of the epigenetic regulators known as \u00a1\u00b0readers\u00a1\u00b1 has recently emerged as a therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment. These epigenetic \u00a1\u00b0readers\u00a1\u00b1 are structurally diverse proteins, which recognize and bind to covalent modifications of chromatin (2). One important modification associated with open chromatin and transcriptional activation is the side-chain acetylation of lysine residues on histone tails (3). The dominant mode of recognition of acetylated lysine residues is by bromodomains, present in 47 human proteins (4?6). We and others have described the therapeutic potential of targeting one bromodomain-containing family important in regulating transcription, epigenetic memory, and cell growth: the BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal domain) family, composed of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT. Numerous hematologic malignancies and the highly malignant solid tumor NUT midline carcinoma are responsive to BET inhibition in vitro and in mouse models (7?12). While disease-specific indications for drugs modifying epigenetic regulators have been uncovered, precise genomic biomarkers predictive of treatment response remain elusive. To date, the best validated genetic predictor of response to BET inhibitors is in a rare genetically-defined subset of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas (NUT midline carcinoma), where the presence of recurrent t(15;19) chromosomal translocation results in the expression of the twin N-terminal bromodomains of BRD4 as an in-frame fusion with the NUT protein (13). High-throughput pharmacogenomic profiling offers the opportunity to reveal new insights into selective responses to drugs in defined cancer genotypes. Initial efforts to connect drug response with genotype in the NCI60 cell line panel have since been expanded to screening campaigns in large panels of genetically characterized cancer cell lines (14?17). These efforts have revealed both expected and unexpected connections. For example, the anticipated response to ALK inhibitors in tumors with aberrant ALK activation, such as lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and neuroblastoma, was demonstrated in a screen of over 600 tumor cell lines (15). More recently, the unexpected connections between response to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and expression of the EWS/FLI fusion protein in Ewing sarcoma was elucidated in a screen of 130 drugs in over 600 cancer cell lines (16). In an independent study of 24 anti-cancer drugs in 479 human cancer cell lines, new connections were also observed between small-molecule sensitivities and cell lineage, gene expression, and genotype (17). We performed a high-throughput pharmacogenomic screen to identify biomarkers of response to BET bromodomain inhibitors. The prototype ligand JQ1, a novel thieno-triazolo-1,4-diazepine, which displaces BET bromodomains from chromatin by competitively binding to the acetyl lysine recognition pocket, has been validated in numerous models, nominating it as an excellent chemical probe for high-throughput screening (7?10). In this study, we therefore queried a large compendium of genetically characterized tumor cell lines to identify predictors of sensitivity to JQ1. We identified MYCN amplification as a top predictive marker of response to JQ1 treatment and characterized the mechanistic and translational significance of this finding in neuroblastoma, the most common extra-cranial solid tumor diagnosed in children, and a cancer notable for frequent MYCN amplification in patients with high-risk disease. Results. High-throughput Pharmacogenomic Profiling Reveals MYCN Amplification as a Predictor of Response to Bromodomain Inhibitors. We first conducted an unbiased screen of a collection of 673 genetically characterized tumor derived cell lines (16) to understand response and resistance to BET bromodomain inhibition, so as to discover new opportunities for therapeutic development. Cell lines with response to JQ1 yielding IC 50 \u00a1\u00c2 1 \u00a5\u00ecM and E max \u00a1\u00c3 70 % were designated as sensitive and all other were designated as resistant in a stringent classification schema. Cell lines arising from the pediatric solid tumor of neural crest origin, neuroblastoma, were identified as among the most JQ1-sensitive and MYCN amplification as the most predictive marker of sensitivity; four cell lines out of the 99 sensitive cell lines are MYCN amplified and zero lines out of the 237 resistant cell lines are MYCN amplified. The two-tailed Fisher exact test returns a P value of 0.007 (Fig. 1A?B and Supplementary Table S1). We next determined expression level of MYCN in the neuroblastoma cell lines from the primary screen (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and evaluated the correlation of MYCN protein levels with JQ1 response. MYCN protein level is also substantially correlated with response to JQ1 treatment (Fig. 1C). We retested one of the most highly sensitive MYCN-amplified cell lines from the screen, BE(2)-C, and multiple additional MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines confirmed to have elevated levels of MYCN protein (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Nearly all of the MYCN-amplified cell lines tested responded to JQ1 and a panel of structurally distinct BET bromodomain inhibitors, each of which conferred a dose-responsive, inhibitory effect on cell viability as well as growth over time (Fig. 1D?F and Supplementary Table S2). The only exception in this cell line panel was NGP, which was comparatively insensitive to all of the BET bromodomain inhibitors tested. Importantly, cell growth was not affected in any cell lines by the (?)-JQ1 enantiomer, which lacks activity against BET bromodomains in biochemical and biological assays, further supporting an on-target mechanism of action. Similarly, we retested one of the least sensitive cell lines from the primary screen, the MYCN-wildtype neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-AS and a second MYCN-wildtype cell line SH-SY5Y not in the primary screen. As predicted, SK-N-AS was insensitive to the effects of JQ1, and SH-SY5Y was less sensitive than the MYCN-amplified cell lines based upon the maximal response (E max) (Supplementary Fig. S2A?B and Supplementary Table S2). JQ1 Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis. To further characterize the phenotypic consequences of JQ1 treatment on responsive MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells, we determined its effects on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. JQ1 treatment induced a G0/G1 arrest and a decrease in S phase at 24 hours by flow cytometric evaluation of propidium iodide staining (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3). There was a progressive increase in cell death, based on the increase in the subG1 fraction, with marked induction of apoptosis confirmed by annexin V staining at 72 hours (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the effect of JQ1 on cell cycle and apoptosis in MYCN-wildtype neuroblastoma was less pronounced (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). Bromodomain Inhibition Downregulates MYCN and c-MYC Transcriptional Programs in Neuroblastoma. Prior research from our laboratory has demonstrated a selective effect of BET bromodomain inhibition on the expression and function of c-MYC in hematologic malignancies (8?10). We thus hypothesized that the selective sensitivity of neuroblastoma lines to BET inhibition may relate to impaired function of the MYCN and c-MYC transcriptional activators. We profiled two of the highly sensitive neuroblastoma cell lines, BE(2)-C and Kelly, treated with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM JQ1 for 24 hours using genome-wide transcriptional profiling coupled with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (18). The top 50 differentially upregulated and downregulated genes are depicted in the heatmap in Fig. 3A and the full list is reported in Supplementary Table S3. Consistent with the established biological role of BET co-activators in chromatin-dependent transcriptional activation, there was a preponderance of downregulated genes in comparison to upregulated genes. Acute JQ1 treatment prompted a dynamic change in transcription, with 122 genes significantly upregulated and 193 genes significantly downregulated based on permutation P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05 for signal-to-noise in the comparison of all vehicle-treated versus all JQ1-treated samples. To assess the effects of JQ1 more specifically on transcriptional programs regulated by either MYCN or c-MYC, we interrogated the data with published, validated gene signatures for statistically significant enrichment by GSEA. GSEA seeks to estimate the significance of over-representation of an independently defined set of genes (e.g., c-MYC or MYCN pathways) in the highly correlated or anti-correlated genes in the gene expression data set. The majority of the MYCN and c-MYC-related gene sets were statistically enriched among genes downregulated by BET bromodomain inhibition in neuroblastoma (Fig. 3B and C). Because the MYCN signature in the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) was derived in small cell lung cancer cells (19), we sought to develop a custom MYCN upregulated signature in neuroblastoma cells utilizing a publicly available data set of primary neuroblastoma tumors characterized for MYCN amplification status (20). This MYCN signature was also highly downregulated by JQ1 treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines based on GSEA (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Table S4). An open-ended enrichment analysis was next performed, as a measure of specificity, on the entire set of transcription factor target gene signatures available from MSigDB (21). In almost all cases, gene sets defined by adjacency to MYC-binding motifs (both MYCN and c-MYC) were highly enriched in genes whose expression is suppressed by JQ1 in neuroblastoma (Fig. 3E). Recently, we reported the unexpected downregulation of MYC expression in multiple myeloma and acute leukemia models by BET bromodomain inhibitors (8?10). Localization of BRD4 to strong enhancer elements proximal to MYC prompted the consideration that expression of amplified MYCN may, indeed, be dependent on BET bromodomains. We therefore evaluated the effects of JQ1 treatment on MYCN expression. While not in the top 100 differentially expressed genes, MYCN expression was significantly downregulated in the genome-wide expression profiling of both neuroblastoma cell lines for three of the four PrimeView representative probes with an average reduction of 50% (Supplementary Table S5). These results were confirmed in the three neuroblastoma cell lines responsive to JQ1 (BE(2)-C, Kelly, and LAN-1) by RT-PCR and immunoblot (Fig. 3F and G). In contrast, MYCN expression was not downregulated in the cell line most insensitive to JQ1, NGP. Finally, c-MYC expression level was reduced in response to JQ1 treatment across all the MYCN amplified or non amplified neuroblastoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5). Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that the MYCN program is downregulated in neuroblastoma cell lines by JQ1 treatment and, as observed for MYC in several hematologic disease models, BET bromodomain inhibition targets the expression of MYCN itself. Context-Independent and Dependent Transcriptional Effects of BET Bromodomain Inhibition in Cancer Cells. While the transcriptional programs altered by BET bromodomain inhibition in individual diseases have been established, an integrated analysis has not yet been performed. To establish neuroblastoma-specific and canonical BET bromodomain-dependent transcriptional pathways, we analyzed three data sets profiling the transcriptional changes associated with JQ1 treatment in cancer cell lines (multiple myeloma (8), AML (9), and neuroblastoma) to determine whether there is a robust, cell context independent JQ1 signature. First, we generated signatures of genes whose expression is regulated (up and down) by JQ1 treatment in neuroblastoma and used this as a gene set to query both the multiple myeloma and the AML transcriptional profiling data sets. There was significant enrichment of these neuroblastoma JQ1 signatures in the hematopoietic malignancies with an FDR < 0.25 (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Next, we developed hematopoietic malignancy signatures for both upregulated and downregulated genes with JQ1 treatment using the multiple myeloma and the AML data sets. We applied these signatures as gene sets to query our neuroblastoma transcriptional profiling data by GSEA. Both of these signatures were consistently enriched in the expected directions in neuroblastoma cell lines treated with JQ1 (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Moreover, all of the JQ1 signatures were enriched in the treatment of AML cells with a structurally distinct BET bromodomain inhibitor, I-BET151 (11), consistent with an on-target effect of JQ1 (Supplementary Fig. S7). Finally, we developed a consensus signature across all three data sets (Fig. 4A) and determined the relevance to primary human neuroblastoma. The consensus JQ1 signature was significantly associated with MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma when projected into a primary human neuroblastoma gene expression profiling data set with annotation for MYCN status and stage, suggesting that the signature has relevance beyond cancer cell lines grown in culture to bona fide human disease (Fig. 4B). We next determined the biological and functional connections among those genes. Notably, while many individual gene sets were significant, there was marked enrichment for multiple gene sets associated with MYCN and c-MYC, E2F, cell cycle, transcription/translation, metabolism and DNA damage/repair (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Table S6). Taken together, this analysis suggests that there is indeed a consensus transcriptional signature altered by JQ1 treatment of cancer cells with c-MYC and MYCN gene sets, and their associated biological functions, serving as hubs. While BET bromodomain inhibition alters a common transcriptional program across structurally distinct compounds and cancers of different lineages, we were also interested in the transcriptional changes unique to MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. In this case, we identified a set of genes whose expression is uniquely altered in neuroblastoma but not in the hematopoietic cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S8). Here, there was evidence of loss of lineage related genes with JQ1 treatment, reflected in the downregulation of gene sets associated with neural crest stem cells and neurotransmitter release, as well as the downregulation of sets of genes with proximal promoter regions containing binding sites for LHX3 (LIM homeobox 3, a gene involved in neural development) and of ZIC3 (zinc finger protein of the cerebellum 3) (Fig. 4D and E) (22). In addition, consistent with the observed phenotypic consequences of the compound in neuroblastoma cells, there was enrichment for gene sets associated with apoptosis (Fig. 4F). A full list of enriched gene sets is presented in Supplementary Table S7. A BET Bromodomain Inhibitor Displaces BRD4 from the MYCN Promoter Region and MYCN Targets Are Downregulated. It was previously shown that BET bromodomain Inhibitors displace BRD4 from the c-MYC promoter region suggesting the hypothesis that BET inhibitors would similarly displace BRD4 from the MYCN promoter region (8). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) PCR, we observed BRD4 localization to the MYCN promoter, as well as a putative enhancer region. JQ1 treatment resulted in displacement of the BRD4 co-activator protein from both elements, providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed JQ1-dependent decrease in MYCN transcription in sensitive neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 5A). Moreover, with JQ1 treatment two well-reported targets of MYCN, MCM7 and MDM2, are confirmed to be downregulated by western blotting, and expression of the neuroblastoma specific target identified in our expression profiling analysis, PHOX2B, is also downregulated (Fig 5B and C). As expected, there is no alteration of these targets in NGP, where JQ1 treatment does not lead to downregulation of MYCN expression. BRD4 Suppression by shRNA Recapitulates the Effects of JQ1 Treatment in Neuroblastoma Cell Lines. Previous studies have focused on the role of a specific BET family member, BRD4, which is potently inhibited by JQ1 and implicated in several malignancies, including NUT midline carcinoma, AML, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and multiple myeloma (7?9). Moreover, a recent siRNA screen to identify synthetic lethal interactions with MYC overexpression revealed BRD4 as a candidate gene (23). Therefore, we studied selective suppression of BRD4 by shRNA in the three JQ1-sensitive neuroblastoma cell lines. Four shRNAs directed against BRD4 were evaluated and demonstrated to alter relative cell viability and growth over a six day time course, with a dose response in all three lines sensitive to JQ1 (Fig. 6A and B). As seen with JQ1 treatment, there was a striking induction of apoptosis (Fig. 6C) and downregulation of MYCN expression by RT-PCR and immunoblot with the top three shRNAs in the three JQ1 sensitive cell lines (Fig. 6D and E). Moreover, as expected, direct suppression of MYCN by shRNA resulted in growth arrest and apoptotic cell death (Supplementary Fig. S9A?C). However, in the JQ1 resistant neuroblastoma cell line NGP, BRD4-directed shRNAs did not alter growth/viability, induce apoptosis or lead to suppression of MYCN expression (Fig. 6A?E). Accordingly to these results, BRD4 knock-down did not significantly diminish growth of two MYCN non amplified cell lines, SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS (Supplementary Fig. S10A?B). Efficacy of JQ1 Treatment in Independent Murine Models of Neuroblastoma. Because there is no consensus regarding the most relevant in vivo mouse model for preclinical testing of a new therapy, we performed in vivo testing of JQ1 in three unique models of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma: a subcutaneous xenograft, an orthotopic primary human xenograft, and an experimentally-derived mouse model of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma (24). First, JQ1 was evaluated in a BE(2)-C cell line xenograft model established by subcutaneous injection into NOD-SCID-IL2R\u00a5\u00e3 nul (NSG) mice. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with 50 mg/kg of JQ1 or vehicle delivered by daily intraperitoneal injection (n = 10 per group) until sacrifice. JQ1 treatment significantly diminished tumor volume and prolonged overall survival compared to control-treated mice without an effect on body weight (Fig. 7A and B and Supplementary Fig. S11A) and no overt toxicities were observed. In contrast, treatment of the MYCN-wildtype SH-SY5Y subcutaneous xenograft with JQ1 did not significantly prolong survival or reduce tumor volume (Supplementary Fig. S11B and C). In the primary human orthotopic xenograft model, a human MYCN-amplified primary neuroblastoma tumor was obtained from a heavily-pretreated child with relapsed metastatic and drug-resistant disease. Tumor pieces were implanted into the kidney capsule of nude mice, and the mice were treated once daily with 50 mg/kg of JQ1 intraperitoneally for 28 days, starting seven days after orthotopic transplantation. As shown in Figure 7C, JQ1 treatment significantly prolonged survival compared to vehicle treatment. Finally, we tested the effects of JQ1 therapy in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma (TH-MYCN) (24). TH-MYCN mice with palpable tumors were treated with JQ1 or vehicle, as above, once daily for 28 days. A marked improvement in survival for JQ1-treated mice was observed (Fig. 7D). Tumor biopsies were obtained on therapy with JQ1 or vehicle and assessed for pharmacodynamic effects. As shown in Figure 7E, JQ1 conferred an inhibitory effect on cellular proliferation evidenced by Ki67 staining, an increase in apoptosis by cleaved caspase 3 staining, and an inhibitory effect on the expression of MYCN itself and its downstream target MCM7 (Fig. 7F). Discussion. Neuroblastoma, a tumor arising from primitive neural crest cells in the sympathetic nervous system, is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor in children (25). While progress has been substantial for treating patients with low-risk disease, the majority of children with neuroblastoma present with high-risk disease, and many of these children will succumb to neuroblastoma despite intensive chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation, surgery and radiation (26). New treatment approaches are clearly needed for these patients as the delivery of dose-intensified, cytotoxic chemotherapy is already maximized. The pathologic activation of MYCN plays a central role in high-risk neuroblastoma, with MYCN amplification identified in 25% of primary neuroblastoma tumors and nearly half of high-risk cases (26?29). Genomic studies of neuroblastoma tumors, including massively parallel sequencing, have failed to reveal other recurrent and imminently targetable molecular lesions, with the exception of mutations in anaplastic lymphoma receptor kinase (ALK) in neuroblastomas which often co-harbor MYCN amplification (20, 30?34). The central role of the MYCN oncogene in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis, and its limited expression in mature, normal tissues, make it a compelling target for drug development. While transcription factor oncoproteins have largely been refractory to conventional drug discovery approaches, the selective targeting of JQ1 in neuroblastoma raises the possibility of targeting MYCN by bromodomain inhibitors in this disease. Indeed, our data also supports the use of other BET bromodomain inhibitors, expanding the possibilities for future clinical testing. While numerous examples now exist of genotypic predictors of chemical phenotypes, particularly for kinase inhibitors (35?37), we are still lacking genetic/genomic predictors of response to most drugs in current clinical use and in early clinical testing. In this study, we reveal the power of large-scale screening of highly annotated collections of cancer cell lines to uncover a strong genetic predictor of response to BET bromodomain inhibitors. Many of the cancer cell lines in our high-throughput screening study, particularly among the solid tumors, were insensitive to JQ1, suggesting that JQ1 is not a general cytotoxic agent. While nearly all of the prior literature supports the use of BET bromodomain inhibitors in hematologic malignancies, our work demonstrates a strong indication for the use of BET bromodomain inhibitors in a genetically defined solid tumor, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. Similar to the observation that MYC is transcriptionally regulated by bromodomain inhibitors, we demonstrated that MYCN expression is repressed both by JQ1 treatment and by shRNA directed against BRD4. Importantly, in the one MYCN amplified cell line (NGP) with no response to JQ1 or other structurally distinct BET bromodomain inhibitors, no downregulation of MYCN expression at either a transcriptional or protein level occurred with either JQ1 treatment or BRD4-directed shRNA. While the precise mechanism for the failure to suppress MYCN expression in NGP by BET bromodomain inhibition is still under investigation, these data support the assessment of MYCN downregulation as a putative approach to response stratification in clinical trials investigating this compound class. Furthermore, while in primary human neuroblastoma tumors, MYCN amplification is strongly correlated with the JQ1 expression signature derived from cell lines, there are some primary human tumors which cluster with the JQ1 signature but lack MYCN amplification, suggesting that additional predictors of response to JQ1 remain to be discovered. In addition to identifying a consensus JQ1 gene expression signature shared by JQ1-responsive cell lines, we also identified a gene signature uniquely regulated in neuroblastoma, including genes associated with neural cellular identity. For example, one of the genes whose expression is uniquely modulated by BET bromodomain inhibition in neuroblastoma is PHOX2B, a gene encoding a transcription factor involved in the differentiation of neural crest cells. PHOX2B is mutated in neuroblastoma, particularly in association with familial neuroblastoma and with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and Hirschprung\u00a1\u00afs disease (38?40). Similarly, tyrosine hydroxylase expression is uniquely modulated by BET bromodomain inhibition with JQ1 in neuroblastoma, a likely explanation for the downregulation of MYCN expression in our GEMM model of neuroblastoma in which MYCN is driven from a tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. The even more dramatic effects of JQ1 on the downstream target of MYCN, MCM7, could be explained by the contribution of a direct inhibitory effect of JQ1 on the interaction of BRD4 and MYCN at MYCN promoter sites. While it will be important in future studies to extend testing of BET bromodomain inhibition to other diseases with MYCN amplification, such as medulloblastoma (41), the open-source nature of publicly available screening data infinitely expands the utility of any individual laboratory\u00a1\u00afs screening efforts by enabling re-mining of the data. For example, if we relax the criteria for identifying candidate biomarkers of sensitivity versus resistance to JQ1 to significant (P \u00a1\u00c2 0.05) values for Fisher\u00a1\u00afs exact test at the twenty-fifth percentile (sensitivity) or the seventy fifth percentile (resistance) of the Ln(IC 50) distribution, NOTCH1 activation is also correlated with response to JQ1, nominating diseases with aberrant NOTCH1 activation, such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (42) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (43), for future study (Supplementary Table S8). Similarly, expression of GNAS, MDM2, and NF2 should be explored as predictors of resistance and the combination of MDM2 inhibitors with bromodomain inhibitors tested. Moreover, the recent report that ALK(F1174L)/MYCN tumors exhibit increased MYCN dosage due to ALK(F1174L)-induced activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways suggests the possibility of combining ALK inhibitors with BET bromodomain inhibitors in neuroblastoma (44). In summary, we have leveraged high-throughput, cell-based screening of genetically characterized cancer cell lines to identify MYCN amplification as a strong predictor of sensitivity to BET bromodomain inhibition. We have confirmed this finding in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma and executed on the preclinical validation of this hypothesis. With a survival advantage observed in three independent in vivo models of neuroblastoma treated with JQ1, including a highly chemotherapy-resistant genetically engineered MYCN mouse model, the clinical development of bromodomain inhibitors for testing in children with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma is already underway. Methods. Genomic Characterization of Cancer Cell Lines. A total of 84 of the most frequently mutated, amplified, deleted or rearranged cancer genes were examined in the cell line collection. 65 genes were sequenced to base-pair resolution across all coding exons for each gene by capillary sequencing. The presence of seven of the most commonly rearranged cancer genes (e.g. BCR-ABL and EWS-FLI1) was determined across the drug screen cell line panel by the design of breakpoint-specific sequence primers that enabled the detection of the rearrangement following capillary sequencing. In addition, analysis of microsatellite instability (MSI) was carried out according to the guidelines set down by \u00a1\u00b0The International Workshop on Microsatellite Instability and RER Phenotypes in Cancer Detection and Familial Predisposition\u00a1\u00b1 workshop (45). Samples were screened using the markers BAT25, BAT26, D5S346, D2S123 and D17S250 and were characterized as MSI if two or more markers showed instability. Total integral copy number values across the footprints of the cancer genes were determined from Affymetrix SNP6.0 microarray data using the \u00a1\u00aePICNIC\u00a1\u00af algorithm to predict copy number segments in each of the cell lines (46). For a gene to be classified as amplified, the entire coding sequence must be contained in one contiguous segment defined by PICNIC, and have a total copy number of eight or more. Deletions must occur within a single contiguous segment with copy number zero. A complete description of the characterization of the cancer cell lines collection used in this study is available from the Cancer Genome Project webpages (47). Cell Line Screening. Cell lines in an exponential phase of growth were seeded at optimal density previously determined to provide maximum signal in control (untreated) wells, while maintaining growth through the experimental exposure. Cells were seeded on Day 1, with drug delivered the following day. Nine concentrations of (+)-JQ1 were applied to cells at a step-wise two-fold dilution series. After 72 hours of drug exposure, cells were fixed and stained with Syto60 (Invitrogen) for fluorescence measurement as described previously (48). Replicate experiments were variably performed for quality assessment during the screening phase. Stringent quality control criteria were applied and estimates of IC 50 were derived from the 9-dose response curves as described previously (16). Drug response is presented as the LN[IC 50] plotted against the E max (the maximum effect corresponding to the minimum measured viability). Enrichment for a given organ of origin (673 cell lines) or genotype (473 cell lines with genotype information) in the sensitive cell lines was tested using a Fisher exact test based approach. Cell lines with response to JQ1 yielding IC 50 \u00a1\u00c2 1 \u00a5\u00ecM and E max \u00a1\u00c3 70% were designated as sensitive and all other were designated as resistant in the most stringent classification schema. Using less stringent criteria, cell lines were assigned to the sensitive or resistant group thresholds corresponding to the twenty-fifth to the seventy-fifth percentile of the distribution of LN(IC 50) values. A Fisher exact test was used to determine the statistical enrichment of a given genotype (or organ) in the sensitive or resistant group at each threshold. In this analysis mutation is defined as either the presence of a specific gene fusion, a sequence change or a copy number change across 84 cancer genes. Cell Culture. Neuroblastoma cell lines were maintained in DMEM (Cellgro, Manassas, VA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin with glutamine (Cellgro). BE(2)-C and SH-SY5Y were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and Kelly, LAN-1, SK-N-AS and NGP were kindly provided by Dr. Rani George. The identity of all lines was verified by small tandem repeat profiling performed by the Shannon McCormack Advanced Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA, USA). Compounds, Cellular Viability, and Growth. JQ1R, JQ1S, I-BET and I-BET151 were synthesized by Dr. Jun Qi. For the testing of multiple BET bromodomain inhibitors in four neuroblastoma cell lines, cells were seeded onto 384-well tissue culture-treated plates at a density of 2000 cells/well in a volume of 50 \u00a5\u00ecL/well. Addition of inhibitor was performed with a JANUS Workstation (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) using a 384-well pinhead tool that is calibrated to deliver 100 nL drug/well. After 72 hours of incubation with inhibitor, cells were analyzed for cell viability using the ATPlite (Perkin Elmer, Waltham MA) luminescent assay kit per the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions using ATP content as a surrogate for viable cell number. Luminescence was read on an EnVision 2104 Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Nonlinear dose response curves were fitted to the data using Graphpad Prism software (La Jolla, CA). To assess growth, neuroblastoma cell lines were incubated with JQ1 in 384-well plates. ATP content was measured on days zero, two, three, and five using CellTiter Glo (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) per the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Flow Cytometry. Cell cycle was determined by measuring DNA content using propidium iodide staining. Apoptosis was measured using the Annexin V: FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit as per the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA). Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting. Protein was extracted from cells by lysis with Cell Signaling Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) containing Complete, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). Immunoblots were run as previously described (49). Primary antibodies included anti-MYCN (Abcam 16898), anti-BRD4 (Abcam 75898), anti-Vinculin (Abcam 18058), anti-MCM7 (Cell Signaling Technology #4018S), anti-MDM2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-813) and anti-Actin (Neomarkers MS1295P). RNA Extraction and Real-time RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from cells with the RNeasy Kit and on-column DNA digestion (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Primers and probes for MYCN (Hs00232074_m1), BRD4 (Hs04188087_m1), PHOX2B (Hs00243679_m1) and the control gene RPL13A (Hs01926559_g1) were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Data were collected in technical quadruplicate, analyzed using the \u00a5\u00c4\u00a5\u00c4CT method, and plotted as percentage of transcript compared to the negative control condition. shRNA Studies. Virus was created by transfecting 293T cells with packaging plasmid (pCMV-d8.9), envelope plasmid (VSV-G), and a pLK0.1 hairpin plasmid (see Supplementary Table S9 for hairpin target sequences) using Fugene 6 per the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions (Promega). It was filtered with a 0.4 \u00a5\u00ecM filter before use. Neuroblastoma cell lines were transduced in 10 cm plates with 2 mL virus and 8 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hours at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, and then 8 mL medium was added to each plate. On day two post-transduction, 2 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL (BE(2)-C) or 1 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml (all other cell lines) puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to select for infected cells and four days post-transduction, experiments to evaluate cell growth, apoptosis, and protein and transcript levels were begun. Genome-wide Expression Analysis. BE(2)-C and Kelly cells were treated in triplicate with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM JQ1 or DMSO for 24 hours. RNA was extracted and a decrease in MYCN transcript was confirmed by real time RT-PCR as described above. The samples were profiled using the Affymetrix PrimeView Human Gene Expression Array (Affymetrix) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA, USA). The computational analysis pipeline was performed on the Genome Space bioinformatics platform (50).  Data Processing. The CEL data files were subjected to quality control and passed tests based on distance between arrays, array intensity distribution and variance mean dependence which are implemented in the ArrayQuality R package (Bioconductor). The raw expression data was processed and log2 transformed by applying the RMA algorithm in the Affymetrix package (Bioconductor). All probe sets with an average log2 expression below four were considered under-expressed and were designated as \u00a1\u00b0filtered\u00a1\u00b1. Of the 49,293 probe sets on the Affymetrix PrimeView Human Gene Expression Array, 45,925 probe sets remained after filtering. The data from the 45,925 probe sets was further collapsed to 19,108 non-redundant genes with distinct HUGO symbols, by assigning to each gene the probe set with the maximum average expression intensity. Gene expression data is available from Gene Expression Omnibus Expression (GEO) (accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE43392\",\"term_id\":\"43392\"}}GSE43392).  Comparative Marker Analysis. The 12 samples available in the data were separated into two groups: 1 \u00a5\u00ecM JQ1-treated samples versus DMSO-treated samples. The Comparative Marker Selection module from GenePattern 3.5.0 (50) was employed to identify individual genes differentially expressed between the JQ1- and the DMSO-treated groups (51). A 2-sided signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) test followed by 1000 permutations of phenotype labels was performed for this analysis. The settings for the SNR parameters were log-transformed-data:yes, complete:no, balanced:no, smooth p-values:yes. A permutation P \u00a1\u00c2 0.05, a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) \u00a1\u00c2 0.05, accounting for multiple hypothesis testing, and an absolute fold change (FC) \u00a1\u00c3 2 served as a cutoff for significant genes. Heatmaps were created with GENE-E software (50).  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The GSEA software (50) was utilized to identify pathways, or groups of functionally related genes, deregulated by the JQ1 treatment (18). The goal of GSEA is to identify groups of genes sharing common biological function (genesets), which are distributed at the top or at the bottom of the ranked list of differentially expressed genes. GSEA assigns to each gene set an enrichment score (ES) calculated as a running sum statistic by walking down the ranked list of differentially expressed genes, increasing the sum when encountering genes in the gene set and decreasing it when encountering genes not in the gene set. The significance of the ES is estimated based on a permutation p-value and adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing through FDR. The set of differentially expressed genes accounting for the enrichment signal is called the leading edge. GSEA was run on the collections of 3272 curated gene sets (c2) and 615 transcription factor targets (c3) from version 3.1 of the Molecular Signatures Database (50). Gene sets with less than 15 genes or more than 500 genes were excluded from the analysis. Gene sets with an FDR \u00a1\u00c2 0.25 and a nominal P \u00a1\u00c2 0.05 were considered significant. The gene ranking metric in the weighted ES was the 2-sided SNR, and the p-values were calculated using 1,000 permutations of the phenotype.  MYCN Amplification Signature. A gene expression upregulation signature to distinguish primary neuroblastoma tumors with MYCN amplification from those without MYCN amplification was created from the expression profiling of primary neuroblastoma tumors ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE12460\",\"term_id\":\"12460\"}}GSE12460, available at the GEO Database) (20). The signature was generated based on the Comparative Marker Selection algorithm of GenePattern with the cutoff threshold 2 for the absolute fold change ratio and the cutoff 0.05 for the p-value and the FDR.  A Consensus JQ1 Signature. A consensus JQ1 signature was created by intersecting the JQ1 differential expression signature in this study with those from the studies by Delmore et al. in multiple myeloma and Zuber et al. in AML (8, 9). This consensus JQ1 signature consisted of 36 genes significantly downregulated and 17 genes significantly upregulated based on the cutoffs of an absolute FC \u00a1\u00c3 2, and p-value and FDR \u00a1\u00c2 0.05. The consensus JQ1 signature was evaluated on the primary neuroblastoma tumor data of Janoueix-Lerosey et al. (20) describing stage and MYCN amplification status. The primary tumor data were projected onto the consensus JQ1 signature and clustered based on the average linkage hierarchical method. The JQ1 consensus signature separated the tumors into two clusters. The association of the tumor clusters with the MYCN status and stage was computed based on the two tailed exact Fisher test. A relaxed consensus JQ1 signature for downregulated genes identified based on the absolute FC \u00a1\u00c31.5 and a p-value and FDR \u00a1\u00c2 0.05 was used in a Functional Enrichment Analysis of the consensus JQ1 signature by GSEA. Functional enrichment analysis results were visualized with Enrichment Map software and functional clusters are listed in Supplementary Table S7.  Neuroblastoma JQ1-specific Signature. A collection of 116 genes significantly downregulated (absolute FC \u00a1\u00c3 2, and p-value and FDR \u00a1\u00c2 0.05) in the JQ1-treated neuroblastoma cell lines vs. control, and unchanged in any of the other two JQ1-treated studies, was identified. The small size of the neuroblastoma JQ1 specific signature, even in a relaxed format, necessitated the use of a Fisher test rather than GSEA to identify the functional relatedness of these genes. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP studies were carried out as described previously using specific primers for the MYCN locus (8). Primers were designed to amplify two sites within the promoter region (5\u00a1\u00c7-3\u00a1\u00c7) and a negative control region outside the promoter region: MYCN promoter site 1 (forward) TTTGCACCTTCGGACTACCC and (reverse) TTTGACTGCGTGTTGTGCAG; MYCN promoter site 2 (forward) TCCTGGGAACTGTGTTGGAG and (reverse) TCCTCGGATGGCTACAGTCT; MYCN negative region (forward) GTATCACCGTCCATTCCCCG and (reverse) TTGGAGGCAGCTCAAAGACC. Enrichment data were analyzed by calculating the immunoprecipitated DNA percentage of input DNA for each sample (triplicate PCR reactions). In Vivo Studies. Cell line xenograft tumors were established by implanting 2 million BE(2)-C-LucNeo cells or 2 million SH-SY5Y cells in 30% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) subcutaneously in the flanks of 6 week old female NOD-SCID-IL2Rc\u00a5\u00e3 null (NSG) mice (Jackson Labs). Serial bioluminescence imaging was performed after injection with 75 mg/kg of D-luciferin (Promega) using a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum instrument (PerkinElmer). Eight days after tumor inoculation, mice with established tumors defined as increasing bioluminescence and measurable tumor volume were divided into cohorts to be treated with 50 mg/kg JQ1 or vehicle (10% DMSO in 5% dextrose) delivered by daily intraperitoneal injection (n=10 per group). Because of rapid tumor growth and saturation, bioluminescence imaging was abandoned as an endpoint. Tumor volume was determined using the equation volume = 0.5 \u00a1\u00bf length \u00a1\u00bf width 2. Mice were sacrificed when tumors reached 2 cm in the longest linear dimension. Statistical significance was determined by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test for survival curves. This study was conducted using protocols approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. TH-MYCN mice with palpable tumors (mean age at detection was 60 +/?15d) were treated with JQ1 via intraperitoneal injection (50 mg/kg in 1:10 solution of DMSO:10% cyclodextrin) or vehicle(1:10 solution of DMSO:10% cyclodextrin), once daily for 28 days (n=5 per group). In the primary human orthotopic model, a human MYCN-amplified primary neuroblastoma tumor was obtained from a child with relapsed, drug-resistant metastatic disease (SFNB-06). Tumor pieces (4mm 3) were implanted into kidney capsule of nude mice and maintained as a continuous xenograft. Human primary SFNB-06 mice were treated once daily for 28 days, starting 7 days after orthotopic transplantation, (dosage as above) (n=5 per group). Statistical significance was determined by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test for survival curves. All mice were monitored until euthanasia was required, in accordance with the University of California, San Francisco, institutional IACUC guidelines. Significance. Biomarkers of response to small-molecule inhibitors of BET bromodomains, a new compound class with promising anti-cancer activity, have been lacking. Here, we reveal MYCN amplification as a strong genetic predictor of sensitivity to BET bromodomain inhibitors, demonstrate a mechanistic rationale for this finding, and provide a translational framework for clinical trial development of BET bromodomain inhibitors for pediatric patients with MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.

                "text": "EGFR and K-Ras Mutations and Resistance of Lung Cancer to IGF-1R Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors\tBackground. Most patients with non?small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have responded poorly to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We investigated the involvement of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling in primary resistance to EGFR TKIs and the molecular determinants of resistance to IGF-1R TKIs. Methods. Phosphorylated IGF-1R/insulin receptor (pIGF-1R/IR) was immunohistochemically evaluated in a NSCLC tissue microarray. We analyzed the antitumor effects of an IGF-1R TKI (PQIP or OSI-906), either alone or in combination with a small-molecular inhibitor (PD98059 or U0126) or with siRNA targeting K-Ras or MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), in vitro and in vivo in NSCLC cells with variable histologic features and EGFR or K-Ras mutations. Results. pIGF-1R/IR expression in NSCLC specimens was associated with a history of tobacco smoking, squamous cell carcinoma histology, mutant (mut) K-Ras, and wild-type (wt) EGFR, all of which have been strongly associated with poor response to EGFR TKIs. IGF-1R TKIs exhibited significant antitumor activity in NSCLC cells with wt EGFR and wt K-Ras but not in those with mutations in these genes. Introduction of mut K-Ras attenuated the effects of IGF-1R TKIs on NSCLC cells expressing wt K-Ras. Conversely, inactivation of MEK restored sensitivity to IGF-TKIs in cells carrying mut K-Ras. Conclusions. The mutation status of both EGFR and K-Ras could be predictive markers of response to IGF-1R TKIs. Also, MEK antagonism can abrogate primary resistance of NSCLC cells to IGF-1R TKIs. INTRODUCTION. Lung cancer, usually caused by years of tobacco smoking (TS), is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. 1. Because conventional chemotherapy has limited efficacy against lung cancer, new targeted therapeutic approaches are being investigated. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is an attractive target in the development of lung cancer treatments. However, treatment with erlotinib and gefitinib, the two EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has produced poor response rates in patients with non?small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 2 Although a group of patients with somatic mutations in EGFR respond to these EGFR TKIs, 2?4 such mutations have been detected in only 5% of tumors from current or former smokers, 2 and a response rate to EGFR TKIs of only 3.9% has been reported in patients with NSCLC and a history of TS compared with 24.7% in NSCLC patients who have never smoked, 5 suggesting that EGFR may not be the appropriate target in NSCLC patients with a history of TS. Signaling through the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) has an essential role in cell mitosis, survival, and transformation 6?9 and has been associated with higher risk of multiple neoplasms. 10?12 IGF-1 stimulates IGF-1R and the IGF-1R/insulin receptor (IGF-1R/IR) heterodimers. Recently, we demonstrated activation of the IGF-1R signaling axis during the early stages of lung carcinogenesis. 13 We found that activation of IGF-1R in the lungs of mice as a result of IGF-1 overexpression led to spontaneous lung tumor development that progressed to adenocarcinoma upon exposure to tobacco carcinogens. This early stage of lung cancer development was suppressed by administration of a selective IGF-1R TKI, cis-3-[3-(4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl)-cyclobutyl]-1-(2-phenyl-quinolin-7-yl)-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazin-8-ylamine (PQIP). 13 Given the importance of IGF-1R signaling in most human cancers and the promising results of clinical trials targeting IGF-1R for cancer therapy, 14 we sought to evaluate the potential application of IGF-1R TKIs in a series of NSCLC cells with variable histologic and genetic characteristics to assess potential determinants of response or resistance to these drugs. Here, we report that the activation of IGF-1R via TS, constitutive activation of EGFR via somatic mutations, and IGF-1R?independent activation of signaling through mutant K-Ras are potential biomarkers of response or resistance of NSCLC cells to small-molecule IGF-1R TKIs, including PQIP and OSI-906. Our findings provide a rationale for the therapeutic use of IGF-1R TKIs, either singly or in combination with MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors, in TS-related NSCLC, particularly in tumors with K-Ras mutations. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Cell Lines. NSCLC cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection or provided by Dr. John Minna (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), Dallas, TX). The cell lines were authenticated by the Genetic Resources Core Facility at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD) using DNA (STR) profiling. Protein Analysis. Total cell or tissue lysates were incubated with anti-IGF-1R antibody (1 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) and protein A agarose for analysis of IGF-1R/IR tyrosine phosphorylation status. The precipitates were analyzed by western blotting with pIGF-1R\u00a5\u00e2 (Tyr1131)/IR\u00a5\u00e2 (Tyr1146) or pIGF-1R\u00a5\u00e2 (Tyr1135/1136)/IR\u00a5\u00e2 (Tyr1150/1151) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Antibodies detecting total IGF-1R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pIGF-1R\u00a5\u00e2 (Tyr1131/1146), pIGF-1R\u00a5\u00e2 (Tyr1135/1136), pErk1/2, pAkt, pIRS-1, total IRS-1, total Erk1/2, total Akt, actin, tubulin, or cleaved caspase-3 (all from Cell Signaling Technology) were used for western blotting. The culture medium without serum was harvested after 2 days of cell culture and concentrated with a Centricon centrifugal filter unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the free IGF-1 in the medium was measured with an ELISA kit from Diagnostic Systems Laboratories (Webster, TX). PQIP and OSI-906 were provided by OSI Pharmaceuticals (Melville, NY). Reverse-phase protein array was performed as previously described 15. Tissue Microarray of Primary Tumor Specimens and the Analysis. Primary NSCLC tumor specimens were collected from 354 patients who had been treated at our institution under an Institutional Review Board?approved protocol and had given their informed consent. Demographic information for those patients was described previously. 16 Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary NSCLC sections (5 \u00a5\u00ecm thick) were placed in a tissue microarray (TMA). Immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation of the NSCLC TMA was performed as previously described. 17 Anti-pIGF-1R (Tyr 1135/1136)/IR (Tyr1162/1163) antibody (Biosource, Camarillo, CA; diluted 1:200) or anti-pEGFR (Tyr1068) antibody (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA; diluted 1:100) was used for staining. Immunostaining for IGF-1R, and pIGF-1R/IR (membrane) was quantified by a lung cancer pathologist who used a four-value intensity score (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+), and the extent of reactivity was expressed as a percentage. A final staining score was calculated by multiplying the intensity score by the extent of reactivity value (range, 0?300). EGFR exons 18?21 and the K-Ras mutational hot spot codons 12, 13, and 61 were amplified as described previously. 3?4, 18 Treated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were sequenced using a Big Dye Terminator v3.1 sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Specimens with single or double EGFR and K-Ras mutations were confirmed using repeated PCR and sequencing, and the corresponding normal DNA was sequenced to verify that the mutations were somatic. In Vitro Drug Sensitivity and Apoptosis Assays. The indicated NSCLC cells were treated with PQIP, either singly or in combination with MEK inhibitors, in 1% FBS. Cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay as described previously. 19 At least 6 independent samples were used for the assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed using immunofluorescence staining with cleaved caspase-3 antibody (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) as described previously. 20 Adenovirus expressing dominant-negative MEK1/2 was described previously, 21 and siRNA against K-Ras was purchased from Dharmacon (Longmont, CO). Anchorage-independent growth in 0.4% agarose with a 1% agarose underlay was measured as described previously. 13 Animal Experiments. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the MD Anderson Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Athymic nude mice (BALB/c) were obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Madison, WI). Xenograft tumors were generated by subcutaneous injection of H226B-K-Ras. Briefly, nude mice were injected at a single dorsal flank site with 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells in 200 \u00a5\u00ecL of phosphate-buffered saline. When tumors reached a volume of 50?200 mm 3, mice were treated orally with vehicle, OSI906 (40 mg/kg per day), U0126 (4 mg/kg, every other day), or both OSI-906 and U0126; the first day of drug treatment was termed day 0. Tumor size was measured every 2 days. Volumes were calculated by 0.5 \u00a1\u00bf a \u00a1\u00bf b 2, in which a is the longer and b the shorter diameter. Mean tumor volumes and 95% confidence intervals were determined. Statistical Analysis. For the TMA data, pIGF-1R expression levels for NSCLC patients with different clinical and demographic characteristics, including sex, history of TS, tumor histologic type, and EGFR and K-Ras mutation status, were compared using Student\u00a1\u00afs t test, the Mann?Whitney U test, or ANOVA. Correlations among TMA specimens stained for pIGF-1R/IR and pEGFR were identified using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. For the drug sensitivity analysis, the two-tailed Mann?Whitney U test was used to compare sensitivity between the mut and wt K-Ras groups of cells. All analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) or SPSS (SPSS, Chicago, IL). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS. Activation of IGF-1R/IR is Associated with Histologic features, History of Tobacco Smoking, and Mutations of EGFR and K-Ras in Human Lung Cancer. We evaluated the expression of pIGF-1R/IR in surgical tumor sections obtained from patients with NSCLC. pIGF-1R/IR staining was detected in the cell membrane (50%), cytoplasm (100%), and nucleus (100%). Given that the nature of IGF-1R as a membrane receptor and the role of nuclear IGF-1R staining are still unclear, we analyzed the membrane staining of pIGF-1R/IR. Given the frequency of EGFR mutation (exons 18?21) in NSCLC patients who have never smoked, those with adenocarcinoma, and those with wt K-Ras 2, 4, 18, 22?24 and the cross-talk between the EGFR and IGF-1R signaling pathways, we assessed the correlation of pIGF-1R/IR staining with the frequency of EGFR and K-Ras mutations in the NSCLC specimens. pIGF-1R/IR expression levels were higher in patients with squamous cell carcinoma than in those with adenocarcinoma (P = 0.019) and were higher in patients with a history of TS (both former and current smokers) than in patients who had never smoked. pIGF-1R/IR level and EGFR mutation were negatively correlated with a marginal significance (Table 1). In addition, pIGF-1R/IR levels were significantly higher in patients with mut K-Ras than in those with wt K-Ras (Table 1). The negative correlation between pIGF-1R/IR expression and mut EGFR and the positive correlation between pIGF-1R/IR expression and mut K-Ras were also observed in patients with adenocarcinoma (data not shown). These findings suggest that activation of the IGF-1R axis is strongly correlated with TS-induced lung carcinogenesis. NSCLC Cell Lines Carrying mut EGFR Are Independent of IGF-1R Signaling for Survival and Proliferation. Given the negative association between pIGF-1R/IR level and EGFR mutation, we sought to explore the impact of EGFR mutation on the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to PQIP, an IGF-1R/IR TKI. 25 We first examined whether the IGF-1R signaling pathway was functional in six NSCLC cell lines carrying mut EGFR (L858R or Del746?750). IGF-1?induced activation of IGF-1R signaling was well preserved (Fig. 1A) and was effectively inhibited by PQIP (Fig. 1B) in the EGFR mutant cell lines. However, the viability and anchorage-independent colony-forming ability of these cells remained unchanged after PQIP treatment (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest that the NSCLC cells carrying mut EGFR harbor functional IGF-1R signaling but do not rely on the pathway for cell proliferation K-Ras Mutation Is a Key Determinant of the Response of NSCLC Cell Lines carrying wt EGFR to IGF-1R Inhibitors. Findings from the NSCLC TMA led us to hypothesize that NSCLC cell lines of which are derived from lung epithelial cells exposed to tobacco smoke, 26 could be dependent on IGF-1R signaling for survival and proliferation, thus providing a vulnerable point for pIGF-1R/IR ? targeted inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we examined a panel of 16 NSCLC cell lines carrying wt EGFR with various histologic features (squamous cell carcinoma, bronchioalveolar carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma) and mutations in K-Ras and p53. We assessed the effects of blockade of IGF-1R signaling by PQIP on the proliferation and viability of these NSCLC cells. When we tested the sensitivity to PQIP at different concentrations (0.2?10 \u00a5\u00ecM), the 16 cell lines displayed differential sensitivity to PQIP treatment (Fig. 2A). We sought to identify predictive biomarkers of PQIP sensitivity in the cells. Although no obvious correlation was seen between PQIP sensitivity and the cells\u00a1\u00af histologic features (Fig. 2A) or expression levels of IGF-1R, IR, or pIGF-1R/IR (Fig. 2B), the NSCLC cells with mut K-Ras (listed in black) tended to have poorer sensitivity to PQIP than did those with wt K-Ras (listed in blue) (Fig. 2A). Moreover, cell lines carrying mut K-Ras (n = 7) showed significantly higher viability than those carrying wt K-Ras (n = 5) at doses of 0.2 and 1.0 \u00a5\u00ecM PQIP (P < 0.05, Fig. 2C) To confirm the role of K-Ras mutation in PQIP resistance, we assessed the effects of PQIP on K-Ras mutant and wild type cells. To investigate the mechanism by which K-Ras mutation rescues NSCLC cells from PQIP treatment, we examined the PQIP-induced antiproliferative activities H460 and H157 cells after mut K-Ras was knocked out by transfection with specific siRNA against K-Ras. Both H460 and H157 cells revealed a significantly enhanced PQIP sensitivity after K-Ras expression was silenced by transfection with specific siRNA (Fig. 2D, top), indicating an essential role of mut K-Ras in mediating PQIP resistance in the NSCLC cell lines. We next assessed the effects of PQIP on IGF-1R signaling in H596 cells, which carry wt K-Ras, and A549 cells, which carry mut K-Ras. We found that PQIP treatment at 1 \u00a5\u00ecM almost completely inhibited IGF-induced IGF-1R and Akt phosphorylation in H596 cells (Fig. 2D, bottom). Similar results were found in A549 cells, indicating that PQIP is effective in blocking IGF-1R signaling in NSCLC cells regardless of K-Ras mutation status. These results indicate that the mechanism by which K-Ras mutation decreases NSCLC cell sensitivity to PQIP is independent of the ligand-induced phosphorylation of IGF-1R. Mut K-Ras Activates IGF-1R/Akt Signaling but Leads to Resistance to IGF-1R/IR TKI. Given the strong positive correlation between IGF-1R activation and K-Ras mutation in the human NSCLC TMA and the inverse correlation between PQIP sensitivity and K-Ras mutation in NSCLC cell lines, we further assessed the role of K-Ras mutation in the IGF-1R pathway and PQIP sensitivity in H226B and H596 cells in which GFP or mut K-Ras had been transduced by retroviral infection. H226B-K-Ras cells showed higher levels of pIGF-1R and pAkt and lower levels of IGF-1R than those in H226B-GFP cells (Fig. 3A). We also observed that H226B-K-Ras cells produced more IGF-1 than H226B-GFP cells did (Fig. 3A). To characterize further molecular sequelae triggered by mut K-Ras, we performed a reverse-phase protein array Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK pathways were activated by mut K-Ras (Fig. 3B). Although PQIP treatment decreased pIGF-1R/IR and pAkt levels in both cell lines, phosphorylation of the downstream mediators of Akt, including pS6, and pGSK, was efficiently inhibited by PQIP treatment in H226B-GFP cells but not in H226B-K-Ras cells (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, H226B-K-Ras and H596-K-Ras cells were significantly less sensitive to PQIP treatment than the control cells were (Fig. 3D), suggesting that IGF-1R signaling is enhanced by mut K-Ras; however, K-Ras mutation abrogates NSCLC cell sensitivity to PQIP by activating downstream signaling, including p70S6K Targeting MEK Overrides the Resistance of mut K-Ras Cells to IGF-1R TKI. Because p70S6K is known to be activated by the MEK/Erk pathway, 27 which can be constitutively activated by K-Ras mutation, we determined whether inactivation of MEK would restore the antitumor effects of PQIP or OSI-906 (a PQIP derivative currently undergoing a phase I clinical trial in our institute in NSCLC cell lines carrying mut K-Ras. We found that co-targeting of MEK, either with a small-molecule MEK inhibitor (PD98059 or U0126) or with adenovirus expressing the dominant-negative form of MEK (Ad-MEK-DN), significantly enhanced the effects of PQIP on cell viability (Fig. 4A) and anchorage-independent colony-forming ability (Fig. 4B) in representative mut K-Ras, resistant cell lines. Furthermore, the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly increased by the combined treatment (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that inactivation of MEK augments the apoptotic activities PQIP in NSCLC cells carrying mut K-Ras. We finally evaluated the combined effects of OSI-906 and U0126 in vivo. The mice treated with vehicle or OSI-906 alone showed similar H226B K-Ras tumor growth (Fig. 4D). Pharmacologic inhibition of MEK by administration of U0126 dramatically augmented the effects of OSI-906 on the growth of the tumors. On day 8 after the first dose, the mean tumor volume for mice that received combined OSI-906 and U0126 was significantly smaller than the mean tumor volume for mice that received vehicle, OSI-906 alone, or U0126 alone. IHC staining of Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 in the tumors demonstrated that the combined treatment induced a decrease in cell proliferation in association with an increase in cell apoptosis in vivo (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these findings underscore the pivotal role of activation of the MEK/Erk pathway through K-Ras mutation in the primary resistance of NSCLC cells to IGF-1R TKIs. DISCUSSION. In the present study, we elucidate potential predictive markers of response of NSCLC cells to IGF-1R TKIs. We show that: 1) the expression of IGF-1R/IR in NSCLC specimens are positively associated with a history of TS, squamous cell carcinoma, wt EGFR, and mut K-Ras; 2) somatic mutation of EGFR, which confers addiction to the EGFR signaling pathway, induces a lack of primary response to IGF-1R TKIs in NSCLC cells; and 3) K-Ras mutation causes increased production of IGF-1 and activation of the IGF-1R pathway but induces resistance to IGF-1R TKIs. Moreover, our findings provide a proof of principle that targeted inactivation of IGF-1R by a TKI, in combination with MEK inhibition, can achieve a favorable outcome in the treatment of NSCLC patients with a history of TS and mut K-Ras. Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown encouraging therapeutic efficacy of EGFR TKI in NSCLC with mut EGFR; 2?3 however, the limited response rates to EGFR TKIs underscore the need to develop effective treatment strategies for patients with wt EGFR. Targeting the IGF-1R pathway is one emerging strategy. The two major approaches are small-molecule IGF-1R TKIs and anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies. However, limited data are available about predictors of sensitivity to the anti-IGF-1R approaches. In this study, we identified predictors that could be used in clinical trials of IGF-1R TKIs in NSCLC patients. Previous studies have shown high levels of IGF-1R expression in squamous cell carcinoma histology 28. By analyzing a TMA of specimens from 354 patients with NSCLC, we extended this observation by showing that high levels of pIGF-1R/IR in patients with squamous cell carcinoma. These data suggest that squamous cell carcinoma may be more sensitive to IGF-1R TKIs than lung adenocarcinoma is. However, previous reports and our current results show that tumor histology is not a predictive marker of response to IGF-1R-targeted strategies. We also observed significantly elevated pIGF-1R/IR levels in patients with a history of TS, those with mut K-Ras, and those with wt EGFR, all of which have been strongly associated with poor response to EGFR TKIs. Numerous studies have suggested that human cancer cells can be highly dependent on single or multiple pathways that are overly activated, conferring tumorigenic potential, 29?31 and successful anticancer therapeutic strategies would rely on the selection of patients harboring tumors that rely on those pathways for cell growth and survival. Our previous and current findings show that transformed lung epithelial cell lines induced by TS components had an elevated expression of pIGF-1R/IR and were sensitive to the molecularly targeted strategies against the IGF-1R system. 32?33 TS components such as NNK have been shown to induce genetic changes in p53 and PTEN, which regulate IGF-2 and IGF-1R expression. 34?35 NNK can also induce phosphorylation and degradation of p53 and inactivation of PTEN via activation of Akt. 40 Although we did not have mechanistic evidence for TS-induced activation of IGF-1R/IR signaling in lung carcinogenesis, impact of the IGF-1R pathway in cell proliferation and survival suggested that targeting IGF-1R could be an effective therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients with TS history. This notion and our subsequent findings, including (1) the characteristics of patients with NSCLC harboring elevated pIGF-1R/IR levels were negatively correlated with those of patients harboring EGFR mutation, and (2) PQIP treatment effectively inhibited stimulation of the IGF-1R pathway but had little antitumor activity in mut EGFR?expressing NSCLC cells, led us to hypothesize that a history of TS and EGFR mutation are predictive biomarkers for no responsiveness to IGF-1R TKIs. However, we found that only a subset of human NSCLC cell lines with high pIGF-1R/IR levels and wt EGFR were sensitive to PQIP treatment. These observations suggest that EGFR mutation is not a predictive marker to response to IGF-1R TKI-based therapies. Considering the potential mechanisms of cross-talk between EGFR and IGF-1R signaling, 19, 36?38 inhibition of IGF-1R signaling could have been compensated for by enhanced activation through EGFR. However, NSCLC cells expressing mut Ras did not exhibit significantly enhanced sensitivity in response to co-targeting of IGF-1R and EGFR by treatment with PQIP and the EGFR TKI erlotinib, whereas the same regimen significantly reduced cell viability in a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines carrying wt Ras (data not shown). It has been suggested that sensitivity of NSCLC cells to TKIs of IGF-1R and EGFR, either alone or their combination, is determined by the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 36, 39. However, EMT status was not a consistent predictive marker for insensitivity to antagonism against IGF-1R or to co-targeting IGF-1R and EGFR 36. These findings indicate the involvement of additional biomolecules that differentiate the NSCLC cell response to IGF-1R TKIs. Our current findings from several in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that mut K-Ras differentiates the response to IGF-1R inhibitors. In the current study, we found evidence that activation of the IGF-1R pathway is correlated with K-Ras mutation, which may increase IGF-1 production, as shown by significantly higher levels of IGF-1 in the conditioned media from H226B cells harboring mut K-Ras compared with those harboring wt K-Ras (Fig. 3A). Therefore, K-Ras mutation could be a driving force for activation of the IGF-1R pathway and may thus be a predictive marker of sensitivity to IGF-1R blocking. However, our subsequent results clearly show that mut K-Ras is a poor predictive marker of the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs: (1) mut K-Ras lead increased resistance to PQIP in many assay systems, and (2) the inactivation of K-Ras or MEK by genomic approaches (siRNA targeting K-Ras, Ad-MEK-DN) or pharmacologic approaches (PD98059, U0126) induced antitumor activity of IGF-1R TKIs (PQIP, OSI-906) in vitro and in vivo in mut K-Ras cell lines. These findings highlight the need for stratification of patients on the basis of K-Ras mutation, in addition to history of TS and EGFR mutation, when an IGF-1R?targeted therapeutic regimen is considered in clinical trials. In summary, this study characterizes potential predictive markers of actions of IGF-1R TKIs. Our findings show that activation of IGF-1R/IR is mutually exclusive with activation of EGFR and is associated with TS in NSCLC, suggesting that transformed lung epithelial cells and NSCLC cells are dependent on IGF-1R/IR signaling for survival and sustained proliferation. However, we also provide evidence for the first time that mutation in K-Ras is associated with activation of IGF-1R and the development of physiologically redundant signaling in patients with NSCLC, implicating mut K-Ras as an important predictive marker to optimize the clinical efficacy of the IGF-1R?targeting strategy. Further investigation is warranted into the discovery of the predictive biomarkers for IGF-1R-targeted therapy and the exact mechanism of synergy between IGF-1R TKIs and MEK inhibitors Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Variants Selectively Infect and Kill Human Melanomas but Not Normal Melanocytes\tMetastatic malignant melanoma remains one of the most therapeutically challenging forms of cancer. Here we test replication-competent vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV) on 19 primary human melanoma samples and compare these infections with those of normal human melanocyte control cells. Even at a low viral concentration, we found a strong susceptibility to viral oncolysis in over 70% of melanomas. In contrast, melanocytes displayed strong resistance to virus infection and showed complete protection by interferon. Several recombinant VSVs were compared, and all infected and killed most melanomas with differences in the time course with increasing rates of melanoma infection, as follows: VSV-CT9-M51 < VSV-M51 < VSV-G/GFP < VSV-rp30. VSV-rp30 sequencing revealed 2 nonsynonymous mutations at codon positions P126 and L223, both of which appear to be required for the enhanced phenotype. VSV-rp30 showed effective targeting and infection of multiple subcutaneous and intracranial melanoma xenografts in SCID mice after tail vein virus application. Sequence analysis of mutations in the melanomas used revealed that BRAF but not NRAS gene mutation status was predictive for enhanced susceptibility to infection. In mouse melanoma models with specific induced gene mutations including mutations of the Braf, Pten, and Cdkn2a genes, viral infection correlated with the extent of malignant transformation. Similar to human melanocytes, mouse melanocytes resisted VSV-rp30 infection. This study confirms the general susceptibility of the majority of human melanoma types for VSV-mediated oncolysis. INTRODUCTION. Of all skin cancers, melanoma has the highest mortality rate, and it accounts for approximately 75% of skin cancer-related deaths (1); the incidence rate has tripled over the last 3 decades (2). One contributing factor to the poor prognosis of advanced stage malignant melanoma is the high predisposition to develop brain metastases. It is the third most common solid tumor to metastasize to the brain, and stage IV melanoma patients have the highest risk (30 to 50%) of all cancer patients of tumor spread to the central nervous system (CNS) (3, 4). FDA-approved drugs such as dacarbazine and interleukin-2 have a limited impact on overall survival due to responses restricted to subsets of patients; the recently approved drug ipilimumab shows benefits in some patients (5). Response rates of newer drugs like BRAF inhibitors are higher (6, 7), but activity of these molecular-target agents depends on the presence of the corresponding mutation. In addition, response duration is often limited due to the development of secondary resistance (8). Key oncogenic driver mutations have been recognized delineating molecular pathways as possible targets for therapeutic intervention (9, 10). Among those, BRAF mutation, PTEN mutation, CDKN2A mutation, and AKT amplification are the most common events. The BRAF V600 mutation stands out as the most common melanoma mutation and is found in 50 to 65% of patients with melanoma (9). A number of viruses have been studied using in vitro and in vivo models of melanoma tumors (11?21). A promising oncolytic virus with broad tropism against many cancers (22), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), has also been studied using melanoma models (23?25). Most of these melanoma studies have focused on mouse melanoma models and have facilitated substantially our current understanding of the role of the immune response in oncolytic virotherapy. However, the most commonly used mouse melanoma cell line B16 may be partially resistant to VSV infection (26). In addition, systemic application of potentially oncolytic virus, which was successfully shown in animal studies on other cancers (22, 27) and which is a prerequisite to target a metastatic tumor, remains to be studied with human melanoma. As an oncolytic virus, VSV displays a strong affinity to tumors with defects in their interferon (IFN) signaling pathway (28, 29), and up to 50% of human melanomas carry defects in this pathway (30). Patients not responding to IFN treatment might ultimately benefit from agents exploiting a defective interferon pathway in these cancer cells. A number of recombinant variants of VSV have been introduced as potential oncolytic agents with modified biological properties mostly focusing on attenuation (22, 31?34). In contrast, the VSV variant used in many experiments in the current study, VSV-rp30, shows a more rapid infection and lysis of human glioma (35) and sarcoma (36) but had not been studied in melanoma. We also tested three other VSV variants including a wild-type-like phenotype (VSV-G/GFP) and attenuated phenotypes VSV-M51 and VSV-CT9-M51. We tested 19 primary human melanoma samples and normal human melanocytes for their susceptibility to VSV-rp30 infection and lysis. We find that the majority of melanomas are completely infected and killed by VSV even in the presence of IFN. This infection appears to be independent from NRAS mutation status; mutations BRAF V600E and BRAF V600K correlated with higher VSV susceptibility. Systemic application of VSV successfully targeted multiple subcutaneous as well as intracranial melanoma xenografts. MATERIALS AND METHODS.  Cells.. Human melanoma tissue from primary and metastatic sites was obtained from surgical cases at Yale New Haven Hospital, as previously described in detail (37). Most human melanoma samples were isolated and obtained from the Specimen Resource Core of the Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer; the YU prefix indicates tissue generated at Yale University. Tissue collection and processing were in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the institutional Human Investigative Committee protocol. Normal human melanocytes were derived from newborn foreskin tissue as described previously (38) and maintained as primary culture in Opti-MEM medium, described below, with the additional supplements 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (16 nmol/liter), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.1 mmol/liter), cholera toxin (2.5 nmol/liter), Na 3VO 4 (1 \u00a5\u00ecmol/liter), and N 6,2\u00a1\u00c7-O-dibutyryladenosine 3:5-cyclic monophosphate (0.1 mmol/liter) (Sigma-Aldrich). Stably transfected rYUMAC cells expressing dsRed red fluorescent protein (RFP) were generated in a manner similar to that described previously (27). Briefly, YUMAC cells were transfected with plasmid pDsRed monomer-C1 coding for monomeric red fluorescent protein under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) ie1 promoter and with a G418 selection construct, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable expression was achieved after 3 weeks of maintenance in medium enriched with G418 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Mouse melanoma lines with defined mutation patterns were derived from transgenic mouse models expressing combinations of melanoma-associated mutations in the form of Braf V600E activation, Pten and/or Cdkn2a inactivation, and \u00a5\u00e2-catenin stabilization as described in detail previously (39?41). In short, mouse models were generated by conditional melanocyte-specific expression of a Tyr::CreER T2 construct leading to Cre-mediated conversion of Braf, PTEN, and other genes. Tumor-associated genes were recombined after release of Cre recombinase from Hsp90 initiated by topical application of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) and subsequent nuclear translocation of Cre recombinase. Tumor tissues were triturated through a 20-gauge needle and filtered through a 100-\u00a5\u00ecm nylon cell strainer. All human and mouse melanoma cells were maintained in Opti-MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and were kept in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 at 37\u00a1\u00c6C.  Viruses.. Six recombinant VSV variants were used in this study: wild-type-based VSV-G/GFP, VSV-rp30, VSV-M51, VSV-CT9-M51, VSV-P126, and VSV-L223. Virus construction and characteristics of the first four have been detailed previously (34). VSV-G/GFP is based on the VSV Indiana serotype with an additional copy of the viral G protein gene fused to the GFP (green fluorescent protein) gene located at the 5th gene position. VSV-rp30 evolved from VSV-G/GFP through repeated passage on and adaptation to U87 human glioblastoma cells (35). VSV-M51 contains a deletion at amino acid position 51 of the VSV M protein; VSV-CT9-M51 is additionally modified by having a truncated cytoplasmic tail of the viral G protein, to 9 amino acids (42). VSV-M51 and VSV-CT9-M51 include a GFP reporter gene at the 5th position coding for cytosolic GFP. VSV-P126 andVSV-L223 are described below. All viruses were plaque purified and propagated, their titers were determined on BHK-21 cells, and they were stored in aliquots at ?80\u00a1\u00c6C. For titer determinations, a standard plaque assay technique with 0.5% agar overlay was employed.  VSV genome sequencing.. Viral genomic RNA was extracted from VSV-G/GFP and VSV-rp30 using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription (RT) of isolated VSV genomic RNA was performed using Thermo-X Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at a reaction temperature of 53.9\u00a1\u00c6C and an RT oligonucleotide with the sequence 5\u00a1\u00c7-ACG AAG ACA AAC AAA CCA TTA TTA TC-3\u00a1\u00c7, designed to anneal to the initial 26 bases of the 3\u00a1\u00c7-end of the VSV genome. Full-length genomic VSV-G/GFP cDNA (13.5 kb) was used as the template in a series of 6 PCRs that generated overlapping products covering the entire genome and ranging in size from 2.0 to 2.7 kb. Primers were designed on the basis of the VSV-G/GFP sequence (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"FJ478454\",\"term_id\":\"218457792\",\"term_text\":\"FJ478454\"}}FJ478454). PCR was performed using the Expand High Fidelity PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), and the reaction products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen). Purified products were sequenced by the W. M. Keck DNA Sequencing Facility (Yale University). Sequencing of each PCR product was performed on both the sense and antisense DNA strands. Potential sequencing ambiguities that arose in one strand were resolved by inspection of sequence results from the complementary strand. Restriction digestion using BsrDI (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) was performed to assess homogeneity of the mutation throughout the VSV-rp30 population. A 2,126-bp PCR product was amplified from VSV-G/GFP and VSV-rp30 cDNA using the same methods as described above and primers 960F, 5\u00a1\u00c7-AAA ACC CTG CCT TCC ACT TC-3\u00a1\u00c7, and 3047R, 5\u00a1\u00c7-AAC AGA TCG ATC TCT GTT AG-3\u00a1\u00c7, at an annealing temperature of 52\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 cycles. The presence of the C1772T mutation in the gene for the P protein of VSV-rp30 creates a unique BsrDI restriction site that yields two smaller species of 1,298 bp and 828 bp. PCR products were purified and quantified as described above, and 350 ng of each was included in restriction digestion reactions and incubated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Digestion products were run on 1.2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.  VSV-P126 and VSV-L223 plasmid construction, virus recovery, and verification.. The plasmid pVSV-G/GFP encoding the parent virus was constructed from pVSV-XN2 (43) and pBS-G/GFP as described previously (44). To construct the genomic VSV plasmid encoding the P126 mutation, a 1-kb BstZ17I-XbaI fragment spanning the N and P genes and including the mutation site was first digested from pVSV-XN2 and then subcloned into pEBX, a modified pCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen). The pEBX plasmid was generated by inserting a short linker encoding a BstZ17I site into the multiple-cloning site (MCS) of pCR-Blunt II-TOPO between the EcoRI and XbaI sites. This linker was prepared by digesting an annealed pair of complementary oligonucleotides and, after insertion, yielded the following modified sequence between the EcoRI and XbaI sites: 5\u00a1\u00c7-GAATTC CA GTATAC TAT TCTAGA-3\u00a1\u00c7 with the EcoRI, BstZ17I, and XbaI sites (in that order) underlined. Insertion of the 1-kb N/P gene BstZ17I-XbaI fragment digested from pVSV-XN2 into pEBX yielded the subclone pN/Psub. Next, a 0.4-kb BlpI-XbaI fragment of pN/Psub was removed and replaced with a comparable gene-synthesized fragment (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ) encoding the P126 mutation to create the plasmid pN/P-P126. This newly mutagenized BstZ17I-XbaI fragment was then digested from pN/P-P126 and used to replace the comparable sequence of pVSV-G/GFP to create pVSV-P126. To construct the VSV plasmid bearing the L223 mutation, a 4.4-kb NheI-FseI fragment encoding the N-terminal half of the L protein gene was digested from pVSV-XN2 and then subcloned into pENFP, another modified version of pCR-Blunt II-TOPO. The pENFP plasmid was generated by first digesting pCR-Blunt II-TOPO with FseI and DraIII, blunting the ends, and then ligating to destroy the FseI and DraIII restriction sites located in an unused Zeocin resistance gene in the plasmid backbone. This procedure resulted in the deletion of 77 bp between the FseI and DraIII sites to create pCR-Blunt II-TOPO(?)FseI/DraIII. Next, a short linker encoding an NheI and FseI site was inserted into the MCS of pCR-Blunt II-TOPO(?)FseI/DraIII between the EcoRI and PstI sites to create pENFP. This linker was prepared by digesting an annealed pair of complementary oligonucleotides and, after insertion, yielded the following modified sequence between the EcoRI and PstI sites: 5\u00a1\u00c7-GAATTC GCTAGC ATA GGCCGGCC CTGCAG-3\u00a1\u00c7 with the EcoRI, NheI, FseI, and PstI sites (in that order) underlined. Insertion of the 4.4-kb L gene NheI-FseI fragment digested from pVSV-XN2 into pENFP yielded the subclone pLsub. Next, a 0.3-kb SacII-BstAPI fragment of pLsub was removed and replaced with a comparable gene-synthesized fragment (Genscript) with the L223 mutation to create the plasmid pL-L223. This newly mutagenized NheI-FseI fragment was then digested from pL-L223 and used to replace the comparable sequence of pVSV-G/GFP to create pVSV-L223. Recombinant VSVs were recovered from pVSV-P126 and pVSV-L223 plasmid DNA through transfection of BHK-21 cells and infection with vaccinia virus-T7 (45, 46). Seed stocks of the additional plasmids used in recombinant VSV recovery (pBS-N, pBS-P, and pBS-L), along with the plasmids pVSV-XN2 and pBS-G/GFP, were kindly provided by J. Rose (Yale University). Verification of the successful recovery of VSV-P126 and VSV-L223 was performed by sequencing RT-PCR products amplified from genomic RNA harvested from infected BHK-21 cells. VSV-P126, VSV-L223, VSV-rp30, and VSV-G/GFP were compared for infection effects, replication rates, and plaque sizes in several human melanomas.  Quantification of infection and cytotoxicity.. All VSV variants express the GFP reporter gene. Cells were seeded in either 24- or 12-well dishes at 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 or 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells per well, respectively, and incubated overnight. VSV variants were added by changing the medium to medium containing the indicated viral concentration for a final multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 or 10 PFU per cell, respectively. At the indicated time points, ranging from 24 to 48 h, infectivity rates of melanoma cultures were assessed as the number of GFP-positive cells compared to the total amount of cells, using an Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope connected to a SPOT RT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). A minimum of 10 microscopic fields were quantified per condition. Phase-contrast imaging was used for assessment of cytopathic effects (CPE) (rounding, blebbing, detachment, shrinkage, and cell fusion). Cytotoxicity was quantified using ethidium homodimer (EthD-1; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which labels dead cells with a red nuclear fluorescence. EthD-1 stock solution was added to infected cultures in 24-well dishes at the indicated time points for a final concentration of 4 \u00a5\u00ecM. Dead cells were quantified in experimental culture dishes after virus infection using a fluorescence microscope.  Interferon treatment.. Interferon pretreatment was performed by incubating cultures with medium containing 100 IU/ml human IFN-\u00a5\u00e1A/D (catalog no. I4401; Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h before adding virus at an MOI of 10. IFN-\u00a5\u00e1A/D is a hybrid molecule based on recombinant human IFN-\u00a5\u00e1A and -\u00a5\u00e1D and acts on both mouse and human IFN-\u00a5\u00e1 receptors, as explained in the Sigma I 4401 product sheet.  Quantitative RT-PCR for analysis of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in human melanoma.. RNA from human melanoma cultures with or without 6-h IFN-\u00a5\u00e1 treatment was isolated from cell lysates using the RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNase-treated RNA was reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). TaqMan gene expression assays were used for quantitative PCR of \u00a5\u00e2-actin and interferon-stimulated genes OAS-1 and Mx1 using an ICycler iQ Real Time PCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Assays were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Each sample was measured using triplicate PCRs. OAS-1 and Mx1 quantities were normalized to corresponding \u00a5\u00e2-actin expression levels for each cell type.  Animal procedures.. For human melanoma xenografts, 4- to 6-week-old immunodeficient homozygous CB-17-SCID mice (Taconic, Inc.) were used. For subcutaneous flank tumor xenografting, mice were anesthetized using a 20% (vol/vol) isoflurane-propylene glycol mix. Melanoma cells (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5) tested for pathogen-free status were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 100-\u00a5\u00ecl suspensions were injected into a skin fold on the flanks of the mice. Mice received subcutaneous flank xenografts at up to 4 different sites. Palpable tumors formed within 3 weeks. For intracranial melanoma xenografts, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a ketamine-xylazine mixture (100 and 10 mg/kg body weight, respectively) and placed into a stereotactic frame. A Hamilton syringe controlled by a Stoelting stereotactic injector (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) was used to inject 1 \u00a5\u00ecl of melanoma cell suspension containing 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 cells into the striatum (2 mm lateral, 0.4 mm rostral to bregma, at a 3-mm depth). The following human melanoma cells were used for intracranial tumor grafts: red fluorescent rYUMAC, melanotic YUSIK, or amelanotic YUSIT. For systemic virus application, a single bolus of VSV-rp30 (1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 8 PFU in 100 \u00a5\u00ecl PBS) was injected via tail vein. Animals were monitored daily for body weight, grooming, and overall health. Mice were euthanized with a pentobarbital overdose and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde at the indicated time points ranging from 2 to 5 days after virus inoculation. Subcutaneous and intracranial tumors were examined via fluorescent stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX12; Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) before microtome sectioning for subsequent histological analysis. All experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines of the Yale University Animal Care and Use Committee. RESULTS.  VSV-rp30 selectively infects a broad range of human melanoma cells.. Little is known about VSV targeting of human melanoma cells freshly derived from patients undergoing resective surgery and potential correlations between melanoma mutation profiles and the susceptibility to viral oncolysis. Here, we present for the first time a large panel of different human melanomas with distinct growth characteristics and mutational defects. Of the 19 human patient-derived melanoma samples tested, 5 originated from primary tumor sites; all other melanomas were collected from metastatic or recurrent sites (Table 1). Compared to the parent wild-type-based VSV-G/GFP, VSV-rp30 showed somewhat enhanced infectivity toward human glioblastoma (35) and sarcomas (36). To determine the general susceptibility of human melanomas for VSV-rp30 infection, semiconfluent cultures of 17 human melanoma samples were infected at a high (10) and low (0.1) MOI. Fluorescence microscopy was used to detect GFP expression to quantify infection rates at 36 h postinoculation (hpi). The ratio of the number of infected cells to total cells is shown in Fig. 1A. Fourteen of 17 melanomas showed complete or nearly complete infection by 36 hpi with a high MOI. Three melanoma types, YUKIM, YULOVY, and YUROL, showed less than 50% infection, even with a high MOI of VSV-rp30, indicating a partial resistance. In contrast, normal human melanocytes were remarkably resistant to VSV-rp30 even at a high MOI, with only 3.8% \u00a1\u00be 0.6% cells infected after 36 h. Low MOI (0.1) conditions are useful to test for the oncolytic potency of a virus since it factors in viral replication as a prerequisite for complete infection of a culture. At a low MOI, the majority of melanoma derivations (11 of 17) showed complete infection by 36 hpi. These include YUAME, YUFIC, YUGen8, YUMAC, YUPEET, YURIF, YUSIK, YUSIT, YUSIV, YUTICA, and 501Mel. Four melanomas, YUKIM, YUNIGE, YUROL, and YULOVY, displayed significantly reduced infection rates, showing fewer than 30% of cells infected. YUDOSO and YUHEF showed substantial infection, with 60 to 80% of cells infected. VSV susceptibility of melanomas with BRAF mutation V600E or V600K was significantly higher than that of non-BRAF-mutated cells (P = 0.02; Mann-Whitney test) (see Fig. 6A, left box). In contrast, NRAS mutation status did not have a significant effect on infection rates (see Fig. 6A, center box) compared to infection rates in cells with wild-type status for BRAF and NRAS (see Fig. 6A, right box). To corroborate the view that infection as determined by reporter gene expression correlates with cell death, we studied cytopathic effects using phase-contrast microscopy. This analysis revealed infected cells displaying robust cytopathic effects (rounding, blebbing, membrane fusion, and detachment) (Fig. 2A, column 2). The ratios of the number of cytopathic cells to the total number of cells paralleled the infection ratios and are shown in Fig. 1B (correlation coefficient for all GFP expression rates versus cell death rates, R, was 0.94 for low MOI and 0.93 for high MOI). Consistent with the small number of cells showing reporter gene expression, normal human melanocytes showed very few signs of cytopathic effects (see Fig. 3C). Ethidium homodimer (EthD-1) stains dead cells only after the integrity of the plasma membrane has deteriorated. To corroborate our morphological analysis, an EthD-1 cell death assay was used to assess a representative selection of human melanoma to confirm the correlation between morphological CPE of virus and subsequent cell death (Fig. 2A, right column). Quantification of ratios of EthD-1-indicated that cell death rates were comparable to CPE (Fig. 2B) at 36 hpi with VSV-rp30 (0.1 MOI), yielding a correlation coefficient, R, of 0.87. These data are consistent with the notion that CPEs observed after VSV infection are indicative of subsequent cell death. YULOVY cells were highly resistant to VSV-rp30 infection as indicated by low GFP and EthD-1 ratios, whereas the other melanomas showed a high level of dead cell staining. In addition to the 17 human melanoma cultures listed above that were systematically compared in parallel experiments, two additional primary melanoma cultures (YUCYLO and YUFULO) were assessed independently for GFP expression and lytic effects after VSV infection in separate experiments (data not shown). A summary of infection susceptibility and other characteristics for all tested 19 melanomas is shown in Table 1.  Effect of interferon administration on VSV infection of human melanoma.. The selectivity of the oncolytic action of VSV is based in part on its sensitivity to interferon-mediated antiviral defenses that protect normal cells from infection. This IFN response is often compromised in tumor cells of various derivations (29, 47). On the other hand, IFN-\u00a5\u00e1 has been used as a therapeutic agent against melanoma and displays a relapse-free survival advantage (48). Tumor responses to IFN vary substantially, possibly indicating that defects in IFN signaling are present in a substantial number of melanomas. We therefore addressed to what extent IFN-\u00a5\u00e1 inhibits VSV infection and cell death of human melanoma cells. Cultures of human melanomas were incubated with 100 IU IFN-\u00a5\u00e1A/D for 3 h prior to application of VSV-rp30 at an MOI of 10. Thirty-six hours later, fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify GFP expression, indicative of infection rates (Fig. 3A). Approximately 37% of the human melanomas tested (7 of 19, i.e., YUHEF, YUMAC, YUNIGE, YUSIK, YUSIT, YUGEN8, and 501Mel) were unresponsive to IFN-mediated protection from VSV-rp30 infection. In contrast, IFN almost completely blocked infection of YUAME, YULOVY, YUPEET, and YURIF cells, all of which except YULOVY were completely infected by VSV under control conditions (Fig. 1A). In addition, IFN reduced infection rates in YUDOSO, YUFIC, YUKIM, YUROL, YUSIV, and YUTICA. The effect of IFN pretreatment on VSV-rp30 infection of human melanoma cells was independent from either BRAF or NRAS mutation status (see Fig. 6B). Interestingly, cytopathic effect rates noticeably exceeded infection rates in the presence of IFN (Fig. 3B) compared to control conditions, in which the extent of cytopathic effects paralleled infection rates (R = 0.81). Even in cells displaying low infection rates, widespread cell death was seen (YUDOSO, YUFIC, YUKIM, YURIF, and YUTICA), suggesting a possible synergistic effect of VSV infection and interferon. We did not, however, observe direct cytotoxicity of IFN-\u00a5\u00e1 on these melanomas in the absence of VSV-rp30, with cell numbers in IFN-treated dishes not significantly different from control cell numbers (data not shown). In contrast to the modest attenuation of infection rates of VSV-rp30 by IFN in melanoma, normal human melanocytes were completely protected by IFN (Fig. 3).  Expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in melanoma cells compared to normal melanocytes.. In order to assess the responses of human melanoma and normal melanocytes to interferon application, we used quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) to examine the expression of two well-characterized interferon-stimulated genes, Mx1 and OAS (49, 50). After 6 h of IFN-\u00a5\u00e1 treatment (100 U/ml), RNA harvested from normal human melanocytes showed a substantial increase in levels of Mx1 (1,900-fold) and OAS (2,930-fold) compared to untreated controls. In contrast, 11 melanomas varied substantially in their IFN response and displayed significantly less induction of ISGs than did control cells. Three melanoma cultures (YUTICA, YUMAC, and YUSIT) showed a considerable induction of ISGs in the range of several hundredfold for Mx1 and OAS. The remaining 8 melanomas showed relatively little induction of ISGs compared to normal melanocytes, with particularly low values seen in YUSIK, 501mel, YULOVY, YUNIGE, and YUDOSO, which responded to IFN treatment with Mx1 induction of only 1.2- to 5-fold and YUDOSO and YULOVY, which showed an OAS induction of only 5- to 6-fold (Fig. 4). Interestingly, with some melanoma cultures, such as YUSIK and 501mel, the strongly attenuated ISG induction correlated with a lack of protection by IFN from VSV-rp30 infection, whereas in other melanomas it does not. Examples for the latter include YULOVY, YUAME, and YURIF, which when treated with IFN show little induction of the tested ISGs but are completely protected from VSV-rp30 infection. Conversely, the melanomas with the strongest upregulation of ISGs, YUMAC and YUSIT, paradoxically showed no protection of these cells by IFN from VSV infection (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The finding that interferon-induced expression of antiviral effectors Mx1 and OAS is not highly predictive of the level of IFN-mediated viral resistance in melanoma cells suggests that ISG expression may not consistently correlate with virus susceptibility.  Comparison of recombinant VSVs in infecting melanoma.. An important factor determining the potency of an oncolytic viral agent is the speed with which it can replicate and locally amplify the cytolytic effect before the adaptive immune system mounts an effective response. From this perspective, a virus with faster replication may present a favorable phenotype. Employing standard plaque assay techniques, we quantified the replication rates of VSV-rp30 and wild-type-based VSV-G/GFP on 15 melanoma cultures and normal human melanocytes. Eighty percent confluent duplicate cultures were infected with each virus at an MOI of 0.1. Samples of supernatant were collected at 7 hpi and at a later time point, 24 hpi. At 7 hpi, virus progeny production varied widely between different melanoma cultures, ranging from 10 2 to 10 6 PFU/ml. VSV-rp30 produced significantly higher titers of progeny than VSV-G/GFP in 13 of 15 melanoma cultures (Fig. 5A). For 12 of these cultures (excluding outlier YUROL) the mean (and standard error of the mean [SEM]) difference of viral replication was 3.8 \u00a1\u00be 0.6 in favor of VSV-rp30. One melanoma culture, YUROL, had an unusually high replication advantage of VSV-rp30 over VSV-G/GFP; however, replication in YUROL was also unusually low and thus showed a relatively large error in the measurement. One melanoma culture, YUDOSO, showed higher titers for VSV-G/GFP than for VSV-rp30 (64-fold). Viral titers were higher at 24 hpi, ranging from 10 5 to 3 \u00a1\u00bf 10 9 PFU/ml. Differences between total virus propagation of VSV-rp30 and VSV-G/GFP were less apparent, suggesting that VSV-rp30's advantage is a factor of speed more than total progeny produced/cell (Fig. 5B). In contrast, measurable viral replication in normal melanocytes was absent at 7 hpi and was highly reduced compared to 14 of 15 melanomas after 24 h. Although not statistically significant, melanoma cells with BRAF mutations showed a clear trend toward greater replication than cells without these mutations (P = 0.07; Mann-Whitney test) (Fig. 6C). No such trend was observed in NRAS-mutated cells (P = 0.14). We also compared VSV-rp30 and VSV-G/GFP with two attenuated VSV-variants, VSV-M51 and VSV-CT9-M51. A representative panel of 5 melanoma cultures were infected with VSV at a low MOI of 0.1 and assessed for CPE rates at 24 hpi. All 5 melanomas, YUFIC, YUHEF, YUROL, YUTICA, and YUGen8, were nearly dead or dying after VSV-rp30 infection, with a mean of 93.0% \u00a1\u00be 2.6% for all 5 samples. In contrast, infection with VSV-G/GFP (60.3% \u00a1\u00be 6.9%), VSV-M51 (55.4% \u00a1\u00be 4.0%), and VSV-CT9-M51 (41.4% \u00a1\u00be 9.0%) resulted in significantly less cell lysis at 24 hpi (Fig. 5C). Importantly, at later time points, even the most attenuated VSV variants resulted in widespread cell death of the melanoma tested (data not shown), indicating that all four VSVs successfully killed multiple melanoma cultures.  VSV-rp30 genome sequencing reveals two nonsynonymous mutations.. VSV-rp30 was originally generated through repeated passage of VSV-G/GFP on human glioblastoma U87 cultures to select viral progeny with faster growth kinetics on multiple human gliomas (35). To identify the mutation(s) associated with this phenotype, we sequenced the entire genome of VSV-rp30 and the parent strain VSV-G/GFP (Fig. 7). The sequences of both viruses were found to be identical except for four point mutations located in the genes for the P protein (C1772T) and L protein (G7693T, A11712G, and C11736T), with nucleotide numbering according to GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"FJ478454\",\"term_id\":\"218457792\",\"term_text\":\"FJ478454\"}}FJ478454 (Fig. 7B). Inspection of the sequence chromatograph data indicated that all of the detected VSV-rp30 mutations were represented by a single unambiguous chromatographic peak (Fig. 7B), suggesting that these mutations were present throughout the VSV-rp30 viral population. The C1772T mutation appears in the second position of codon 126 of the P protein gene and results in a replacement of the serine (S) in VSV-G/GFP with a leucine (L) in VSV-rp30 (S126L). The G7693T mutation appears in the first position of codon 223 of the gene for L protein and results in a replacement of the asparagine (D) in VSV-G/GFP with a tyrosine (Y) in VSV-rp30 (D223Y). The A11712G and C11736T mutations were both silent base substitutions appearing in the third position of codons 1562 and 1570 of the L protein gene. Since the C1772T mutation results in the creation of a Bsr DI restriction site in VSV-rp30, we were able to further assess the apparent homogeneity of this mutation within the viral population by means of restriction digestion. Using a 2.1-kb PCR product encompassing the C1772T mutation site, Bsr DI yielded a complete digestion of the VSV-rp30-amplified PCR product and no detectable digestion of VSV-G/GFP-derived product (Fig. 7C). These results indicate an absence of any detectable sequence heterogeneity within the VSV-rp30 population at the identified mutation site. Because sequencing VSV-rp30 revealed two nonsynonymous mutations, we asked whether both mutations are required for the oncolytically enhanced phenotype of VSV-rp30. We generated single mutant variants VSV-P126 and VSV-L223 by inserting the corresponding mutations into the parental wild-type-based strain VSV-G/GFP. Plaque-purified and expanded stocks of VSV-G/GFP, VSV-rp30, VSV-P126, and VSV-L223 were generated at the same time and compared for infectivity, spread, and propagation in three human melanoma cultures. Cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 and analyzed at 15 hpi (Fig. 7D). Infection rates were higher in VSV-rp30-infected cultures than in VSV-G/GFP-infected cultures for all three melanomas tested. Similarly, single mutant VSV-P126 showed GFP expression rates greater than that of VSV-G/GFP but lower than that of VSV-rp30. VSV-L223, on the other hand, showed little or no increased infectivity compared to VSV-G/GFP (Fig. 7E). For quantification of viral progeny generation of the 3 VSV variants, we used plaque assays of serial dilutions of supernatants of infected melanoma cells collected at 15 hpi. VSV-rp30 reached titers 5.2-fold higher than those of VSV-G/GFP. The single mutant VSV-P126 increased titers 2.2-fold compared to VSV-G/GFP. VSV-L223 did not increase viral titers significantly (Fig. 7F). The inability of a single mutant to recapitulate the full effect of VSV-rp30 and the absence of a substantive effect of the L-protein mutation alone suggest the possibility for a synergistic relationship between the two active mutations. We next used viral plaque size measurements on human melanoma cultures. Virus dilutions were plated onto melanoma monolayers, covered with an agar overlay, and analyzed a day later (Fig. 7G). VSV-rp30 (mean \u00a1\u00be SEM, 131% \u00a1\u00be 2.4%) and VSV-P126 (120% \u00a1\u00be 2.5%) generated larger plaques than the parent virus VSV-G/GFP (100% \u00a1\u00be 2.1%). VSV-L223 showed little to no difference compared to VSV-G/GFP (101% \u00a1\u00be 2.2%).  Defined mutation pattern in oncogenically transformed mouse melanocytes correlates with VSV susceptibility.. Most cancers are caused by a combination of mutations that lead to unrestricted growth. Although the status of two melanoma-associated mutations (in BRAF and NRAS) was determined for most of the human melanomas tested in our study, the complete set of mutations was not. We therefore employed a mouse melanoma model with only one to three defined mutations. The number of mutations required for cancer formation can be relatively small. In mice, induction of changes in as few as two genes can transform melanocytes into melanoma cells with high penetrance in vivo (40). We asked whether an increased level of VSV infection correlated with particular mutations driving melanoma formation. Mouse melanomas were formed by induction of specific mutations in Braf, Pten, Cdkn2a, and beta catenin (Ctnnb1) in various combinations (40, 41). In order to investigate whether there is a correlation between transforming mutations and VSV oncolysis, 7 mouse melanoma cell lines with different induced mutations and normal mouse melanocytes were infected at a low MOI (0.1) and analyzed for GFP expression and cytopathic effects at 24 hpi. Although no clear correlation between any single mutation and the extent of VSV infection was observed, we noted a trend toward increased infection rates in melanoma cells with a greater number of mutations compared to melanomas with fewer mutations or melanocytes with no mutations (Fig. 8). For example, melanoma designation 1111, with only two mutations (Pten and Cdkn2a), showed an infection rate 7-fold lower than those of melanoma type 2901 or 0888, with three mutations (Braf, Pten, and Cdkn2a). Comparing the infectivity of three-mutation melanoma cells with that of two-mutation melanoma cells revealed a trend toward higher susceptibility of cells with more mutations (P = 0.09; one-tailed Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test) for VSV infection.  Targeting single and multiple intra- and extracranial human melanoma xenografts by intravenously administered VSV.. We previously showed that systemically applied VSV successfully targets human glioma and sarcoma in intracranial and subcutaneous in vivo tumor models (27, 36). Here, we address the potential of VSV-rp30 to target human melanoma in vivo after tail vein injection; immunocompromised CB17 SCID mice received either subcutaneous or intracranial xenografts or a combination of both. To emphasize the multisite characteristic of metastatic melanoma, mice received up to 4 subcutaneous flank tumors (Fig. 9A, displaying two tumors). To facilitate the identification of tumor cells, human YUMAC cells were stably transfected with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter gene (in the following referred to as rYUMAC) (Fig. 9B and ?andC).C). Three weeks after tumor seeding, mice received an intravenous application of 100 \u00a5\u00ecl VSV-rp30 containing 10 8 PFU. Tumors were harvested at 3 or 5 days postinfection (dpi). Fluorescence microscopy analysis of the subcutaneous rYUMAC melanoma masses revealed substantial (3 dpi) or complete (5 dpi) infection of the tumor mass, which could easily be distinguished from surrounding normal tissue due to its red fluorescence (Fig. 9E and ?andH).H). GFP expression in VSV-infected tumors indicated selective and complete targeting of the red tumor mass. No viral infection was noted in the surrounding tissue or in sections of liver, spleen, or heart (not shown). To assess the long-term safety of VSV-rp30, adult Swiss-Webster mice (n = 18) were given a strong dose of intravenous virus (10 8 PFU) into the tail vein. Over the course of >30 days, we found no negative consequences. All mice remained healthy and showed no weight loss and no neurological symptoms. We found no VSV reporter gene expression in any of the major organs after the mice were euthanized. These data suggest that widespread virus inoculation does not generate health problems and that the virus is eliminated over time. For intracranial melanoma xenografts using stereotactic injection of 1 \u00a5\u00ecl of melanoma cell suspension containing 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 cells, three different melanoma cultures were chosen for CNS placement: rYUMAC (n = 5), melanotic YUSIK (n = 6), and amelanotic YUSIT (n = 6). Of the mice receiving intracranial rYUMAC, three also carried subcutaneous rYUMAC tumors and two mice received 4 intracranial injections each. Of the mice transplanted with YUSIK or YUSIT, three of each group received a single striatal injection and three mice received intracranial injections at three different locations plus subcutaneous tumor grafts. Four to 6 weeks after melanoma inoculation, most mice received 100 \u00a5\u00ecl of VSV-rp30 containing 10 8 PFU. Additionally, a short-term tumor growth protocol was used for two rYUMAC-carrying mice, in which VSV-rp30 was applied 5 days after intracranial tumor injection. Brains of mice were harvested between 2 and 5 days and analyzed using fluorescence microscopy for signs of VSV targeting of the tumor masses. YUSIK tumors (Fig. 10A) and single tumor cells (Fig. 10C) were highly melanotic and could be microscopically detected via bright-field imaging. GFP expression patterns indicating virus infection were found to be exclusively limited to melanin granule-containing cells (Fig. 10B and ?andC).C). Of note, even cell clusters composed of few cells distant from the main tumor were successfully targeted by VSV. Importantly, no signs of infection were seen outside the tumor in the surrounding brain parenchyma at the times examined. DAPI (4\u00a1\u00c7,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) nuclear stain was used to assess cells in the tumor and surrounding normal brain tissue (Fig. 10E). YUSIT tumor xenografts were found to grow amelanotic without melanin granules. As with YUSIK xenografts, the whitish YUSIT tumor mass showed complete infection by VSV without GFP-reported signs of infection outside the tumor mass (data not shown). Two mice intracranially injected with rYUMAC melanoma cells were used in an alternate setting with a shortened time between tumor inoculation and virus injection. Five days after tumor inoculation, mice received the same intravenous dose as above. The rYUMAC short-term tumor xenografts featured cell dispersion that was easily traceable due to the red fluorescence of rYUMAC cells and reduced tumor organization with few signs of tumor vascularization. Three days after systemic VSV-rp30 application, brains were harvested, and fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed successful targeting of rYUMAC short-term grafts by VSV-rp30 (Fig. 10F to ?toJ).J). This is particularly noteworthy because the tumors at this stage are considerably smaller and lack the tumor organization shown in tumors grown for weeks. Two additional mice carrying intracranial rYUMAC tumors were left untreated; the mice were sacrificed after 3 weeks, and brains were analyzed for tumor expansion. Tumors remained strongly positive for RFP expression; no green fluorescence was detected in the absence of virus (Fig. 10K to ?toNN). DISCUSSION. In light of the genetic heterogeneity of advanced-stage melanoma, we tested a large panel of 19 human melanoma samples in which some of the driver mutations had been identified. As listed in Table 1, they comprise a wide selection of phenotypes of primary and metastatic tumors. The majority of the human melanoma samples tested were highly susceptible to VSV oncolysis; in contrast, normal melanocytes were resistant to infection.  Human melanoma samples.. Most previous reports on VSV and melanoma focused on mouse melanoma tumors in syngeneic models (25, 26, 51, 52). The most commonly used B16 mouse melanoma model has been referred to in some studies as VSV resistant or partially resistant (24), whereas in others it was shown to be VSV susceptible (53). VSV activates an immune response against mouse melanoma that can reduce tumor mass (54, 55). Our data showed that VSV is very efficient at infecting and killing the majority of melanomas tested but was less efficient in targeting a minority of melanomas. Our samples were directly derived from excised human melanoma samples with minimal cell passaging. Recent work on melanoma cell lines that have been long established shows a similar refractoriness to virus infection in a minority of lines (56). Established cancer cell lines often accumulate additional mutations that promote long-term propagation in vitro. The human melanoma cells used here were taken directly from patients' tissue with minimal passaging and present a closer approximation of the endogenous genetic and pathological situation. Thus, our data based on freshly prepared melanoma are consistent with findings based on the long-term cultures of established cell lines. In our work with primary human melanoma in vitro, only 5 of the 19 melanoma samples showed a low rate of infection after low-titer virus application; the remaining 14 melanoma cultures were very susceptible to VSV. This ratio (26% resistance) is consistent with a previous report of VSV infection resistance rates (22) of established cancer lines from the NCI 60 panel, which included some melanomas, and with a recent report on 6 established melanoma lines (56). In our hands, the observed cytopathic effect (CPE) rates and EthD-1-staining of dead cells across the panel correlated very highly with infection rates (R = 0.94 and R = 0.87, respectively), consistent with the rapid cell death-inducing consequences of VSV infection (57) and supportive of the potential efficacy of VSV as an oncolytic agent in melanoma. Importantly, normal human melanocytes showed a remarkable inherent resistance to infection. To our knowledge, a direct comparison of VSV susceptibility of human melanoma and normal human melanocytes has not been described before, nor has there been an analysis of VSV infection in a broad panel of partially genotyped melanomas.  Melanoma infection and interferon.. One mechanism of VSV oncoselection is based on defects of the interferon pathway (47, 58). Here, in the context of VSV oncolysis of advanced melanoma, the role of the interferon response is fundamental in two aspects: (i) IFN is an approved drug for melanoma therapy, and (ii) IFN is a key element underlying VSV oncoselectivity. IFN has been FDA approved for adjuvant advanced-stage melanoma therapy (2). IFN shows a direct growth-arresting effect on a subset of malignancies (59, 60). On the other hand, resistance to the antitumor action of IFN is common (30, 61). Melanomas less responsive to IFN might be expected to be impaired in their antiviral responses. When melanoma cultures were preincubated with IFN, we found VSV infection to be greatly attenuated in 5 samples, whereas infection was not or only mildly affected in 12 other samples. Type I IFN receptor activation is followed by an upregulation of several hundred IFN-stimulated genes (62). The ISG (OAS and Mx1) response of normal human melanocytes exposed to IFN was orders of magnitude greater than that of the 11 melanoma cultures tested. Although YUSIT and YUMAC had the strongest Mx1 response among tumors, and despite the known association of Mx1 expression with VSV resistance, YUSIT and YUMAC were among the melanoma samples that appeared to be unprotected by IFN. Conversely, several melanomas that showed protection from VSV infection by IFN (YUAME, YUDOSO, and YURIF) did not demonstrate a strong ISG response for Mx1 or OAS. That the Mx1 and OAS response to IFN does not correlate with the ability of IFN to protect melanoma from VSV suggests that other ISGs might underlie IFN-mediated protection. Although many ISGs are upregulated by IFN, in tumor cells with multiple mutations this may not be the case, and expression of the ISG(s) most responsible for inhibiting VSV growth (whose identity is an open question) may not correlate with expression of the two ISGs measured here (Mx1 and OAS).  VSVs effectively infect melanoma cells.. All recombinant VSVs tested were effective in killing multiple melanoma cultures with somewhat different rates of infection. VSV-G/GFP and VSV-rp30 displayed a faster course of melanoma infection and cell killing, but over time, the more attenuated variants VSV-M51 and VSV-CT9-M51 also killed melanoma cells. Building upon our previous report of the effectiveness of VSV-rp30 on human sarcoma tumors (36), the current data support the view that although VSV-rp30 was originally adapted to human glioblastoma cells, its enhanced oncolytic profile is not restricted to glioblastoma cells (35). Our viral replication studies revealed that VSV-rp30 propagated faster than VSV-G/GFP in the majority of melanomas, particularly at early collecting points. Some studies have suggested that replication speed is crucial for the success of oncolytic virus treatment because fast-replicating viruses would spread further through tumor tissue before the antiviral immune response reaches its full potential (63). Furthermore, faster oncolytic action consequently leads to larger amounts of tumor cell debris and tumor cell antigens being exposed in the initial round of infection, which can enhance an antitumor immune response. In contrast, others have argued that the therapeutic effect of oncolytic viruses might in large part depend on virus-induced stimulation of antitumor immune response and that rapidly replicating viruses impair the overall effect by diverting immune response elements from the tumor to the virus (54). Of note, the latter studies focused on multiple virus injections into single tumors; in contrast, systemic application of oncolytic VSV in a setting in which tumor metastases have spread throughout the body may confer some advantage in attenuating melanoma. In this setting, fast viral replication would be desirable to ensure widespread early tumor infection before the systemic immune system is upregulated to control further virus spread. Sequencing and comparing the genome of VSV-rp30 revealed the presence of four mutations in VSV-rp30: C1772T (S126L) in the viral P protein and G7693T (D223Y), A11712G, and C11736T in the viral L protein, with the last two being silent mutations. Because the P and L proteins of VSV form an RNA polymerase complex that is responsible for both viral mRNA transcription and genome replication, mutations in these proteins can affect viral propagation. Whereas the P protein itself may not display enzymatic activity, it may modulate L protein activity, with phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues on P being important for this function (64). Interestingly, the mutation at position P126 falls within the active domain 1 of the P protein, which has been suggested to function as a binding domain for the L protein (65), potentially underlying a synergistic action between the two mutations in VSV-rp30. The hypothesis about the two mutations affecting the direct interplay between the P and L proteins is supported by our findings that single mutant recombinant VSVs expressing either P126 or L223 do not fully recapitulate the enhanced phenotype of VSV-rp30; this suggests either an additive or synergistic effect of the two active mutations.  In vivo systemic virus application to tumor xenografts.. A key challenge of our study was to address not only the multisite tumor location of metastatic melanoma but also the common CNS involvement of this disease. Advanced melanoma has a high propensity to spread to the CNS. Systemic application of VSV as a cotreatment modality for melanoma was described recently (23, 66) in studies that centered on VSV as an adjuvant immunotherapeutic agent in a murine B16 melanoma model. To our knowledge, systemic application of VSV against human melanoma has not been previously shown. We demonstrate that a single intravenous application of VSV is sufficient for targeting and productive spread throughout multiple tumors; this stands in contrast to findings with in vivo applications in mouse B16 melanoma models (23, 54), although part of the difference may relate to the status of the systemic immune system. Importantly, single cells that had spread from the site of tumor placement in the brain were still targeted by intravenous VSV, indicating that the virus can find single tumor cells. VSV was able to infect large portions of the tumor within a few days. A sterile needle stab wound or xenotransplantation of nontumor control cells into the brain did not lead to CNS entry and infection after systemic injection of VSV (27). This supports the notion that VSV-rp30 targets both established and developing tumors. VSV-M51 mutants have been described as safe in mice after intratumoral injection (56). Although VSV-rp30 infected melanoma tumors faster than the two M51 mutants (VSV-M51 and VSV-CT9/M51) that we tested, control immunocompetent mice given a high intravenous dose of VSV-rp30 showed no adverse health consequences. At the time of tumor analysis, no viral infection was observed beyond the tumor border or in any control tissue samples (liver, spleen, or lung), supporting a tumor-selective targeting of infection. However, since we examined human melanomas in SCID mice, in the long term such immunocompromised mice may not fully clear virus infections (27). On the other hand, attenuation of VSV variants and systemic immune targeting of VSV enhance the safety profile of VSV application in the brain (34, 67, 68). Future work will need to address the balance between high replication speed and strategies to limit the potential for neurotoxicity.  Melanoma mutations and VSV susceptibility.. Analysis of a large panel of human melanoma provided the opportunity to compare melanoma driver mutation patterns with susceptibility for viral infection and oncolytic control by VSV. One of the most frequent driver mutations in melanoma formation is BRAF V600E, found in approximately 50% of cases, and associated with a higher risk for developing brain metastases (3). Other common mutations include NRAS mutations, found in 15 to 20% of melanomas (9). We generated a cumulative scoring system for VSV oncolytic susceptibility (OS score), which combined infection rates, replication potency, and IFN insensitivity for each melanoma type. Table 1 lists all melanoma cells used in this study ranked by OS score from high to low (OS score 9 being the highest). Cells with BRAF mutation showed a significantly higher OS score than cells with wild-type BRAF or cells with RAS mutation. When dissecting individual susceptibility parameters, all human melanomas with BRAF mutations showed complete infection, in contrast to cells with normal BRAF, which displayed various degrees of infection. This suggests that BRAF mutations might be predictive for successful VSV targeting. Nonetheless, about one-half of the non-BRAF-mutated cells also show significant VSV susceptibility, suggesting that BRAF mutation alone is not a prerequisite for VSV infection. Corroborating the notion that BRAF-mutated cells are likely to be successfully targeted by VSV oncolysis are the results from our viral replication analysis, in which all tested BRAF-mutated cells produced substantial amounts of viral progeny. In contrast, we did not find strong evidence for a clear correlation between RAS mutations and VSV infection. Importantly, the absence of either the BRAF or the RAS mutation did not exclude enhanced VSV infection. If confirmed with larger samples, this might lead to the possibility that unlike novel specifically targeted therapeutic agents like the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032), which shows activity in patients with the corresponding mutation, oncolytic VSV might potentially serve as a potential therapy option for a broader range of patients. Although the status of selected melanoma-associated mutations was determined for all our tested human melanoma cells, the global genetic alteration status was not. We therefore employed a mouse melanoma model in which tumors from transgenic mice expressing combinations of oncogenic mutations in Braf, Pten, Cdkn2a, and beta catenin were used to study VSV infection rates. In human melanoma, we found that BRAF-mutated cells were highly susceptible to VSV oncolysis. In mouse melanoma, BRAF-mutated cells 2901 and 0888 showed complete infection, compared to partial infection in other BRAF-mutated cells, i.e., 0753 and 2697. Therefore, unlike human melanoma, BRAF status alone does not appear to be predictive for VSV oncolysis in mouse melanoma. Similarly, neither inactivation of Cdkn2a nor beta catenin activation determined VSV susceptibility in mouse melanoma. However, despite the lack of single gene association, cells with a greater number of mutations appeared to show greater infection than cells with fewer mutations, suggesting a trend for an association between the number of genetic defects and VSV infection. In summary, we show that human melanomas are an attractive selective target for VSV-mediated direct oncolysis. The high degree of direct oncolysis in human primary melanoma complements previous work showing that the VSV can initiate or enhance an immune attack on mouse melanoma (26, 51, 54, 55, 66).

Although SkE has previously been shown to have cytostatic and/or cytotoxic activities in some tumor cell lines, its mechanism of action has not yet been characterized. We show here that SkE in the high nanomolar range inhibited the growth of various leukemic and solid tumor cell lines. Importantly, SkE was highly efficient at inhibiting chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells that exhibit constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway and, accordingly, it impaired the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. SkE also abrogated MEK1/2 and B-Raf phosphorylation but had no effect on Ras activity. Moreover, SkE was particularly effective against melanoma cell lines carrying the B-Raf-V600E mutation. Importantly, SkE resensitized the PLX-4032-resistant 451Lu melanoma cell line (451Lu-R) and was more efficient than U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and PLX-4032 (PLX) at inducing the apoptosis of two Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) patient samples carrying the B-Raf-V600E mutation. Finally, SkE was as efficient as imatinib at inhibiting tumor formation in a xenograft model of CML cells in athymic mice. In conclusion, we show that SkE, a very potent inhibitor of B-Raf-V600E, is highly effective against cancer cell lines that exhibit constitutive activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. INTRODUCTION. Simalikalactone E (SkE) is a new quassinoid extracted from a widely used Amazonian antimalarial remedy derived from Quassia amara L. (Simaroubaceae) leaves. In the mid-nanomolar concentration range, this new molecule inhibits the growth of Plasmodium falciparum cultured in vitro by 50%, independent of the strain sensitivity to chloroquine. SkE can also decrease gametocytemia when present at a 50% inhibitory concentration seven fold lower than that of primaquine, a leading compound for treating malaria. SkE is less toxic than simalikalactone D (SkD), another antimalarial related quassinoid from Quassia amara, and its cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells is dependent on the cell line; it displays a good selectivity index when tested on non-tumorigenic cells. In vivo, SkE inhibits murine malarial growth of Plasmodium vinckei petteri by 50% at doses of 1 and 0.5 mg/kg body weight/day when administered by the oral and intraperitoneal route, respectively [1]. Furthermore, unpublished data from our laboratories have established that SkE may have potent antileukemic activity on several hematological malignancies. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is frequently altered in cancer cells, and mutations in this pathway are recurrent in several hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic malignancies [2, 3]. It is also worth mentioning that mutation of an upstream protein in the MAP kinase pathway excludes the possibility of mutation of another protein in the pathway [4, 5]. For instance, N-Ras, one of the upstream regulators of the pathway, is mutated in 20% of melanoma, whereas K-Ras is mutated in 80% of pancreatic carcinoma. B-Raf, an effector of Ras and the upstream kinase in the ERK cascade, is frequently mutated in melanoma (50-70%) [6], Langerhans cell histiocytosis (57%) [7], thyroid carcinoma (40%) [8] and colorectal cancer (8%) [9]. The frequency of B-Raf mutation is generally very low in leukemia; however, it was recently reported that B-Raf is mutated in most cases of HCL [10-12]. Finally, mutations in MEK1 are also detected at a low frequency in melanoma [13]. In all cases, the mutated protein seems to be endowed with constitutive activity. Inhibitors of B-Raf such as PLX have been introduced recently with success as new anti-melanoma agents that can induce complete remission in patients [14]. Unfortunately, resistance to PLX has been found to occur rapidly after the onset of treatment, mainly through reactivation of the MAP kinase pathway [15]. Therefore, it is essential to develop new therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting the MAPK pathway in these resistant patients. Importantly, HCL is another disease characterized by the B-Raf mutation [10]. HCL is a rare leukemia affecting B cells. This hematopoietic malignancy is associated with the B-Raf V600E mutation in most of patients. This hallmark of the disease has provided the rationale for the use of vemurafenib (PLX-4032) in two patients suffering from HCL who had no other therapeutic options [16]; Peyrade et al. 2012 (in press). In both cases, a two-month treatment with the drug led to elimination of the leukemic clone as well as restoration of normal erythrocyte, platelet and leukocyte counts, which were accompanied by a considerable improvement in the patient status. In the present study, we describe the activity and mechanism of action of SkE, a new natural compound extracted from Quassia Amara that exhibits both potent anti-leukemic and anti-melanoma effects in vitro and in vivo because of its ability to interfere with the ERK cascade. Therefore, SkE should be tested as a new therapeutic option in cancers that exhibit constitutive activation of the ERK pathway. RESULTS. SkE exerts potent antileukemic activity in vitro. We have reported previously that SkE is both cytostatic and cytotoxic for some tumor cell lines [1]. The present study was conducted to address the mechanism of action of SkE in different cancer cell lines. We first used the well-characterized human K562 cell line to determine whether SkE affects the proliferation of leukemic cells. To this end, we performed colony formation assays in soft-agar using increasing doses of SkE or a maximal dose of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets BCR-ABL, the fusion oncoprotein responsible for this disease. As expected, imatinib (1\u00a5\u00ecM) inhibited the clonogenic potential of K562 cells in soft-agar by more than 90% (Figure ?(Figure1A).1A). Importantly, SkE was a highly potent inhibitor of K562 cell colony formation in identical conditions, with a maximal effect at 500 nM (Figure ?(Figure1A).1A). At this dose, SkE was even more potent than imatinib, the leading therapy for CML. The IC50 value for the SkE effect was found to be 250 nM. SkE was also a very potent inhibitor of CD34+ cell growth for cells isolated from two CML patients at diagnosis (Figure ?(Figure1B).1B). Finally, SkE also exerted potent antileukemic effects on several imatinib-resistant CML cell lines (not shown). SkE inhibits the MAP kinase pathway. In an attempt to identify the potential targets of SkE, we used the PathScan\u00a2\u00e7 RTK signaling antibody array kit from Cell Signaling, which allows the simultaneous quantification of the activity of approximately 50 kinases. Among these kinases, two were significantly affected by SkE. Indeed, SkE inhibited the activity of ERK by 70% and c-Abl by 15% (Figure 2 A and B). To confirm the effect of SkE on BCR-ABL activity, we next incubated K562 cells for 2 h with 250 nM of SkE and analyzed the phosphorylation status of both BCR-ABL and known BCR-ABL substrates. In accordance with the results obtained with the RTK signaling array kit, we confirmed the inhibition of c-Abl by SkE as judged by the decreased phosphorylation of c-Abl as soon as 3 hrs after the addition of SkE to the culture medium. We also noted a decrease in the phosphorylation status of STAT5 (Figure ?(Figure2C).2C). Moreover, dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 was clearly detected as soon as 30 min after the addition of SkE and was maximal at 15 h. Collectively, our results confirm that SkE is a very potent inhibitor of the ERK pathway in K562 cells. Furthermore, it appears that c-Abl dephosphorylation did not precede ERK dephosphorylation but rather followed ERK inhibition. Figure ?Figure2C2C also shows that SkE failed to affect autophagy in K562 CML cells, as assessed by the absence of delipidation of LC3-b in cells treated with this drug. SkE is a B-Raf inhibitor. We next used the \u00a5\u00c4Raf-1:ER (HEK-ER) cells, which express an inducible form of the kinase Raf-1, to assess the effects of SkE in comparison with U0126, a well-known inhibitor of MEK1, in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Tamoxifen induced the activation of the ERK pathway, as assessed by the increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Figure ?(Figure3A).3A). Importantly, SkE (500 nM) was as efficient as U0126 (2.5 \u00a5\u00ecM) at abolishing tamoxifen-induced ERK1/2 activation (Figure ?(Figure3B).3B). To precisely identify the target of SkE, we analyzed the entire ERK pathway. SkE efficiently inhibited the phosphorylation status of both MEK1/2 and B-Raf (Figure ?(Figure3C).3C). However, SkE failed to affect the activity of Ras in a GST-RAS pull-down assay (Figure ?(Figure3D).3D). Collectively, our data clearly demonstrate that SkE acts as an inhibitor of B-Raf. Finally, the effect of SkE on the ERK cascade was rapidly reversible upon withdrawal of the drug (Figure ?(Figure3E3E). SkE inhibits the growth of PLX resistant-cell lines in vitro. PLX, also known as vemurafenib, has been shown to be highly effective in both B-Raf V600E melanoma cell lines and in patients with metastatic melanoma. However, in patients, the rapid reactivation of the ERK cascade is responsible for relapses. We investigated whether SkE was capable of resensitizing PLX-resistant cell lines.To this end, we used dabrafenib (GSK2118436) sensitive and resistant melanoma cell lines which also exhibits cross resistance to vemurafenib (PLX-4720). This PLX-sensitive 451 melanoma cell line and its PLX-resistant counterpart were incubated for 24 h with PLX (1 \u00a5\u00ecM) or two concentrations of SkE and the cell viability was assessed using the XTT assay. As expected, the 451Lu-R melanoma cell lines [22] were fully resistant to PLX, whereas both the 451Lu-R cell lines were highly sensitive to the effect of SkE (Figure ?(Figure4A).4A). Importantly, PLX-resistant cells appeared to be even more sensitive to SkE. We next analyzed the efficiency of U0126, PLX and SkE on blood cells from two HCL patients carrying the B-Raf V600E mutation. SkE, at a concentration of 500 nM, induced cell death in more than 70% of the blood cells, as assessed by propidium iodide staining (Figure ?(Figure4B),4B), whereas PLX and U0126 were less efficient, triggering 55% and 44% cell death, respectively. As a whole, these findings show that SkE also exhibited high activity against the B-Raf V600E mutation. SkE inhibits the growth of CML cells in athymic mice. To address the efficacy of SkE in vivo, we investigated the ability of the drug to inhibit the growth of the K562 CML cell line implanted in athymic mice. To this end, K562 cells carrying the luciferase gene were injected in the flanks of athymic mice. Mice were randomized and separated into three groups. When tumors reached 100 mm 3 in size (after 5 days), each subgroup of mice was treated daily with an intraperitoneal injection of vehicle, 60 mg/kg imatinib or 1 mg/kg of SkE. At day 18, imatinib and SkE had induced tumor regression to a similar extent (Figure ?(Figure5A).5A). The tumor size was evaluated by photon imaging at days 3, 9, 14, 16 and 18 following the injection of 30 mg/kg of luciferin (Figure ?(Figure5B).5B). The inhibitory effect of SkE on K562 cell growth in vivo was detected as early as 14 days after the onset of injection. By days 16 and 18, there was almost complete regression of tumors in the imatinib and SkE-treated mice. Finally, histological slides of tumors clearly showed dephosphorylation of ERK in tumors collected from SkE-treated mice at day 18 (Figure ?(Figure5C).5C). Clearly, there was also a visible decrease in the number of K562 cells present in the tumors of SkE-treated animals. Taken collectively, these data demonstrate that SkE (1 mg/kg) is as effective as imatinib (60 mg/kg), the leading compound for treating CML patients, which is used to inhibit CML cell growth in vivo. Moreover, the effect of SkE in vivo relied on ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. DISCUSSION. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is a very attractive target in cancer therapy. Indeed, numerous solid and hematopoietic tumors exhibit activation of this pathway following genetic alterations either in upstream signaling molecules, such as receptor tyrosine kinases and oncogenic fusion proteins, or in overexpression of one of the elements of this pathway [2, 3]. The upstream regulator of the cascade, Ras, is mutated in 20 to 30% of human cancers. Of note, the frequency of K-Ras mutations is very high in advanced pancreatic cancers [23]. Mutations in the downstream kinase B-Raf are also frequently found in cancers. This is well exemplified in melanoma, in which B-Raf mutations are present in 50-70% of patients, and in HCL, in which the frequency of B-Raf mutations is close to 100%. In both cases, the B-Raf-V600E mutation is consistently detected. The downstream kinase MEK1/2 is mutated at a low frequency in some cancers, and, to date, there is no evidence of mutation in the downstream kinase ERK1/2. In addition to mutations in various elements of the cascade, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is found to be activated in a very large number of hematopoietic and solid tumors [2, 24, 25]. For instance, constitutive activation of the pathway is also observed independent of activating mutations in solid and hematopoietic malignancies, including CML, in which the BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein (which drives the pathology) is responsible for ERK1/2 activation. Importantly, our group and others have also reported a high constitutive activation of ERK1/2 in several tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant CML cell lines [26-28]. Of note, SkE was also found to be highly effective at killing these tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant CML cell lines (data not shown). The present study was conducted to determine whether SkE could be used as an antitumoral agent. We show here that very low doses of SkE efficiently inhibited the growth of several solid and hematopoietic cancer cell lines, including melanoma and CML cell lines. Of note, SkE was highly efficient in cells exhibiting constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. For instance, SkE was found to be ten-fold more effective in melanoma cell lines carrying the V600E B-Raf mutation than in melanoma cell lines that did not carry a mutation (Supplementary Figure 1). In addition, SkE was also very potent in CML cell lines exhibiting constitutive activation of the MAP kinase pathway following the expression of the BCR ABL fusion protein. To decipher the mechanism of action of SkE, we used both melanoma and CML cell lines and primary cells from patients diagnosed with melanoma and HCL and demonstrated that low concentrations of SkE interfere with the activation of ERK, as shown by the clear inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We next sought to identify the specific point in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway affected by SkE in different cellular models with either constitutive or inducible MAPK kinase activation. Importantly, SkE impaired the activities of both MEK and B-Raf. By contrast, SkE failed to affect Ras activity, strongly suggesting that the drug acts at the level of B-Raf to inhibit the ERK pathway. At present, it is not known whether SkE also affects the activity of other Raf isoforms, including A-Raf and C-Raf. Importantly, chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug with a chemical structure different from SkE, has previously been reported to inhibit ERK activation [29]. However, the chloroquine dose necessary to achieve complete inhibition of ERK in human peripheral blood monocytes in this study was 1000 times higher than the one used in the present study for SkE in melanoma and CML cell lines. This very high potency of SkE in inhibiting B-Raf prompted us to assess its activity in melanoma cell lines carrying B-Raf-V600E mutations and in primary cells from HCL patients who consistently carried this mutation. SkE potently inhibited the growth and clonogenic potential of both cell lines, confirming the very potent anti-tumoral effect of this drug, particularly in cells exhibiting constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Owing to its ability to inhibit lysosomal protease, chloroquine is often used as an inhibitor of autophagy, a catabolic process that can favor cell survival in adverse conditions, such as cellular stress and nutrient deprivation [30]. In this line, the inhibition of autophagy can sensitize cancer cell lines to chemotherapy, and several clinical trials have been initiated that include chloroquine as a second-line therapeutic agent in different forms of cancers [31, 32]. However, the findings presented herein clearly establish that an optimal concentration of SkE failed to affect the lipidation of LC3, arguing against an effect of SkE on autophagy induction when used as a single drug. In the present study, we also demonstrated that SkE drastically reduced the growth of CML cells in athymic mice. A dose as low as 1 mg/kg of SkE was sufficient to inhibit the growth of K562 cells, whereas 60 mg/kg of imatinib mesylate, the leading treatment for CML, was required to obtain a similar effect. These results clearly show that SkE has an excellent in vivo bioavailability in mice. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of SkE are intimately linked to its ability to interfere with the MAP kinase cascade. This was confirmed by our analysis of tumor histological slides from athymic mice grafted with K562 CML cell lines, which clearly showed a complete inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in SkE-treated mice. Finally, we also present evidence that SkE is highly effective at circumventing dabrafenib (GSK2118436) resistance in melanoma cell lines. Dabrafenib is a potent B-Raf inhibitor currently used in phase III studies for metastatic melanoma. It has been reported that dabrafenib initially induced complete remission in patients with metastatic melanoma [14]. However, following this initial beneficial response, all of the patients relapsed. Relapses are likely due to the reactivation of the MAPK pathway and, accordingly, MEK inhibitors such as U0126 can efficiently resensitize dabrafenib-resistant cell lines in vitro. Our group and others have recently reported that the B-Raf inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX-4720) is very effective in HCL patients who carry the B-Raf V600E mutation, inducing complete remission and the restoration of normal blood cell counts and hemoglobin concentration in patients with refractory HCL [11]. Another important finding of the present study is that low concentrations of SkE can inhibit the growth of primary cells from HCL patients more efficiently than vemurafenib (i.e., inhibition occurs in the high nanomolar range versus the micromolar range). In conclusion, we describe here for the first time the unusual ability of the new compound SkE to inhibit B-Raf activation not only in melanoma and HCL but also in CML cell lines exhibiting constitutive activation of the ERK pathway. In addition, we show that this drug is highly effective at inhibiting HCL-patient-derived primary blood cells carrying this mutation and at inhibiting melanoma melanoma cell line with acquired resistance to the B-Raf inhibitors PLX-4720 and GSK2118436. Finally, we also show evidence that SkE at very low doses is highly effective in a preclinical murine model of CML. Collectively, our findings show that SkE could be a new weapon in the armamentarium of drugs targeting cancers that exhibit constitutive activation of the ERK pathway and that SkE warrants testing in humans.

The human CML K562 cell line was provided by ATCC and was grown at 37\u00a1\u00c6C under 10% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FCS (Gibco BRL, Paisley, UK) and 50 units/ml of penicillin, 50 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml streptomycin and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. 293 RAF/ER cells are a derivative of HEK-293 (ATCC: CRL1573) cells that stably express a fusion protein comprising the catalytic domain of Raf-1 and the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor. 293 RAF/ER cells were cultured in DMEM without phenol red, supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS, as described previously [17]. The 451Lu melanoma cells, which are sensitive or resistant to PLX-4720, were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Measurement of cell metabolism (XTT). Cells (15\u00a1\u00bf10 3 cells/100 \u00a5\u00ecl) were incubated with the different effectors for the times indicated. A total of 50 \u00a5\u00ecl of XTT reagent (sodium 3\u00a1\u00c7-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid hydrate) was added to each well. Absorbance of the formazan dye produced by metabolically active cells was measured at 490 nm as described previously [18]. Each assay was performed in quadruplicate. Western Blot. Western blot analyses have been previously described in detail [19]. Phosphoprotein array analysis. K562 cells were treated (or not treated) with 250 nM SkE for 2 hours. Cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed as described for Western blot analysis. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 g for 5 minutes at 4\u00a1\u00c6C), and the protein levels were normalized using the Bradford assay. Then, 150 \u00a5\u00ecg of cell extracts was left on the chip as described in the RTK Pathscan array kit from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). After incubation and successive steps of washing, the arrays were dried and imaged using a Fujifilm LAS-3000 Imaging System. Duplicate spot intensities were quantified from each array image using the Image J quantification software (U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Primary cell isolation. Blood samples were collected from patients newly diagnosed with CML or HCL as part of an institutionally approved cellular sample collection protocol. Informed consent was obtained according to institutional guidelines. Mononuclear cells were isolated from blood samples by density centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque\u00a2\u00e2 Plus), washed with PBS, 5% SVF, and 2 mM EDTA, and then resuspended in cell culture medium (IMDM, 10% fetal bovine serum) and incubated overnight at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in a 5% CO2 incubator. CML cells were labeled with CD34 microbeads isolated by magnetic positive selection (StemSep\u00a2\u00e2 Human CD34 Selection Kit; StemCell, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Purity was estimated to be at least 90% by FACS analysis. Experiments were performed using an IMDM (10% fetal bovine serum) for CML and HCL cells. Colony formation assay. SkE was added to the K562 CML cell lines (10 3 cells/ml) growing in semi-solid methylcellulose medium. MethoCult H4100 was used for cell lines (StemCell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada). Colonies were detected after 10 days of culture by adding 1 mg/ml of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) reagent and were scored by Image J quantification software (U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Microscopic analysis of tumors. Tumors from control or SkE-treated mice were removed, frozen and cut in preparation for immunostaining. Slides containing a representative section of each tumor were fixed, permeabilized and incubated with anti-phospho-ERK 1/2 or anti-ERK antibodies diluted in PBS and 1% BSA at RT for 1 h. Then, cells were washed and incubated with a secondary anti-Rabbit antibody. Finally, DAPI was used to label the nuclei, and the slides were mounted and then analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (LEICA TCR5500, Leica, Somls, Germany). Tumor regression experiments in athymic Mice. Female athymic NMRI Mice (Janvier, Le Genest Saint Ile, France) were randomized into 3 experimental groups, each containing 7 animals. Two sets of animals received a 200 \u00a5\u00ecl injection of 5.10 6 K562-Luc leukemia cells in both flanks. When tumors reached 100 mm 3, the animals were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle (PBS), Imatinib or SkE at dose levels of 60 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg body weight, respectively. The growth of the leukemic cells comprising the tumor was visualized in the animal at different days after intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences) by bioluminescence imaging with a Photon Imager (Biospace Lab), as described elsewhere [20]. The in vivo study was conducted according to French legislation on laboratory animal use and care (N\u00a1\u00c62001-464). Measurement of cell death. Following U0126, PLX-4720 or SkE treatment, HCL cells were stained with propidium iodide, and the stained cells were analyzed with a cytometer. Extraction and purification of simalikalactone E. SkE was extracted and purified from Quassia amara as previously described [1]. Pull-down of the activated form of Rho GTPase. K562 cells were incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C with 250 nM SkE for the indicated times. Ras activity was determined after GST-pull-down. Ras-GTP levels were determined using GST-c-Raf RBD to pull down active GTP-bound Ras from cell extracts by glutathione beads. The beads were washed 4 times and subjected to SDS/PAGE (12% polyacrylamide). Ras and Phospho-ERK1/2 proteins were detected by Western blot analysis as described previously [21]. Statistical analysis. All data are presented as the mean \u00a1\u00be SD of at least three independent determinations. P-values were determined using the Prism V5.0b software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). Unless stated otherwise in the figure legend, comparisons of the different groups were made with the one-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction. P-values of 0.05 (*), 0.01 (**) and 0.001 (***) were considered statistically significant. Supplementary Figures. Acknowledgments. We are indebted to Drs. M. Herlyn and J.

                "text": "Selecting Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor with Secondary KIT Activation-Loop Domain Mutations\tAdvanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), a KIT oncogene-driven tumor, on imatinib mesylate (IM) treatment may develop secondary KIT mutations to confer IM-resistant phenotype. Second-line sunitinib malate (SU) therapy is largely ineffective for IM-resistant GISTs with secondary exon 17 (activation-loop domain) mutations. We established an in vitro cell-based platform consisting of a series of COS-1 cells expressing KIT cDNA constructs encoding common primary\u00a1\u00besecondary mutations observed in GISTs, to compare the activity of several commercially available tyrosine kinase inhibitors on inhibiting the phosphorylation of mutant KIT proteins at their clinically achievable plasma steady-state concentration (Css). The inhibitory efficacies on KIT exon 11/17 mutants were further validated by growth inhibition assay on GIST48 cells, and underlying molecular-structure mechanisms were investigated by molecular modeling. Our results showed that SU more effectively inhibited mutant KIT with secondary exon 13 or 14 mutations than those with secondary exon 17 mutations, as clinically indicated. On contrary, at individual Css, nilotinib and sorafenib more profoundly inhibited the phosphorylation of KIT with secondary exon 17 mutations and the growth of GIST48 cells than IM, SU, and dasatinib. Molecular modeling analysis showed fragment deletion of exon 11 and point mutation on exon 17 would lead to a shift of KIT conformational equilibrium toward active form, for which nilotinib and sorafenib bound more stably than IM and SU. In current preclinical study, nilotinib and sorafenib are more active in IM-resistant GISTs with secondary exon 17 mutation than SU that deserve further clinical investigation. Introduction. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common type of mesenchymal tumors in the gastrointestinal tract and usually refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Recently, 85?90% of GISTs are found to harbor gain-of-function mutations of KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), which leads to promoting cell proliferation and escaping from apoptosis [1]. Over 90% of primary KIT mutations in GIST occur in either juxtamembrane domain (exon 11) or extracellular domain (exon 9), and rarely in the cytoplasmic ATP-binding domain (exon 13/14) or activation-loop domain (exon 17) [2]. Imatinib mesylate (IM; Gleevec\u00a2\u00e7, Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) and sunitinib malate (SU; Sutent\u00a2\u00e7, Pfizer Inc., USA) are oral multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) competing with ATP for the ATP-binding site of several receptor tyrosine kinase. Both of them selectively block the activation of KIT and PDGFR [3]. Currently, IM 400 mg/day is the standard first-line treatment for unresectable or metastatic, non-exon 9 KIT mutated GISTs and 800 mg/day for exon 9 mutated ones, with a clinical benefit response rate and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 85% and 2.3 to 4.0 years, respectively [4]. The well recognized mechanisms of IM resistance include acquired an add-on secondary mutation on the ATP binding domain or the activation-loop domain of KIT, overexpression of KIT, loss of KIT expression accompanied with activation of alternative pathways, TKI-induced quiescence, or potential role of cancer stem-cells [5]. Among them, acquired secondary KIT mutation is the most commonly observed etiology [5], [6]. Based on the results of two clinical trials, the current standard of care for IM-refractory GISTs is SU [7], [8]. However, genotype analysis showed that patients with secondary KIT mutation involving activation-loop domain have poor PFS and overall survival (OS) [7], [9]. In nowadays, SU remains the standard of care for IM-refractory GISTs regardless the status of their secondary KIT mutation. Clinically, some patients with secondary KIT mutation involving activation-loop domain experienced rapid disease after switch their treatment from IM to SU, as shown in Fig. 1. In the past few years, several commercially available TKIs, for example, nilotinib, dasatinib and sorafenib, are under clinical investigation for IM/SU-resistant GISTs. Nilotinib is designed based on the structure of IM and shows higher affinity to the ATP-binding site of ABL kinase to overcome IM-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and also selectively inhibits KIT and PDGFR [10]. Dasatinib, an oral TKI for both BCR-ABL and Src family, is also a second-line drug for patients with IM-resistant CML and able to inhibit the activation of exon 11 Val560Asp or exon 17 Asp816Val KIT mutants [11]. Sorafenib is a multi-target inhibitor actively against BRAF, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2/3, PDGFR, and KIT Trp557_Lys558del/Thr670Ile mutant expressed in Ba/F3 system and also has the activity to suppress the growth of GIST with KIT exon 11 fragment deletion in xenograft mouse model [12]?[14]. Besides, recent data suggested that all three agents exhibit varied degree of activity against IM/SU-resistant GISTs with a disease-control rate (DCR, complete or partial response plus stable disease for 6 months or more) ranging from 25 to 70%. Unfortunately, genotype study has rarely been reported in these clinical studies. Whether individual KIT TKI preferntially against certain genotype of IM/SU-resistant GISTs remain largely unknown. This issue is clinically important because it may not only be useful in selecting optimal treatment for IM/SU-resistant GISTs but also help to identify potentially more active second-line treatment for IM-resistant GISTs with secondary activation-loop mutation, for which SU showed little activity. In this study, we used an in vitro cell-based drug screening platform, which consists of a series of COS-1 cells expressing KIT cDNA constructs encoding mutant exon 9 Ala502_Tyr503insAlaTyr, 11 Val555_Leu576del, 11 Val560Asp, 13 Val654Ala, 14 Thr670Ile, 17 Asp820Gly, and 17 Asn822Lys either alone or in combination to mimicking the common KIT mutations observed in GISTs, to study the potential activity of several commercially available KIT TKIs at their achievable serum steady-state concentration. The results were further validated by their growth inhibition activities on human GIST48 cells with exon 11/17 double mutations. In addition, we applied molecular modeling/docking analysis to delineate the underlying molecular structure mechanisms of interaction between TKIs to mutant KIT proteins. Materials and Methods. Construction of KIT Mutants. A 2.9 kB full length complimentary DNA (cDNA) of wild-type KIT was obtained by reverse transcription PCR from the messenger RNA (mRNA) isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a volunteered study initiator, cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and confirmed by sequencing. KIT mutants with single and/or double mutations were constructed using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), while one mutant with long segment deletion of exon 11 from 555 to 576 (exon 11 Val555_Leu576del) was attained using slicing overlap extension PCR [15]. The primers were listed in Table S1. The signed informed consent was obtained from the blood donor and the recombinant DNA experiment was approved by Human Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board, National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan. Cell Lines and Reagents. COS-1 cells were obtained from Dr. Shih (Neng-Yao laboratory, National Health Research Institute, Taiwan) where they acquired from The NHRI Cell Bank and maintained in 10% FBS/DMEM (Hyclone, Waltham, MA). GIST48 cells, with a homozygous exon 11 Val560Asp and a heterozygous exon 17 Asp820Ala mutation, were a gift from Fletcher (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and maintained in 15% FBS/F10 (Invitrogen) plus 1% bovine pituitary extract and 0.5% Mito+\u00a2\u00e2 serum extender (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) as previous reports [5], [9]. IM and nilotinib, and sorafenib were kindly supplied by Novartis and Bayer, respectively; while SU and dasatinib were purchased commercially. Primary antibodies for total KIT and KIT Y703 were purchased from DAKO (Dusseldorf, Germany) and Invitrogen, respectively. Other primary antibodies included ACTIN (Millipore, Billerica, MA), AKT, AKT S473 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Transient Transfection and TKI Treatment. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000\u00a2\u00e7 according to manufacture\u00a1\u00afs protocol (Invitrogen). In brief, COS-1 cells at about 90% confluence in 6-well dishes were admixed with 2 \u00a5\u00ecg of plasmid KIT/pcDNA3.1 and 2 \u00a5\u00ecL of Lipofectamine 2000\u00a2\u00e7 for 6 hours. Transfected cells were recovered by incubation in growth media for 18 hours. After another 2-hour starvation in FBS-free DMEM, the transfected cells were treated with TKIs for 30 minutes before harvested. GIST48 cells were treated with TKIs for 30 minutes after starved 2 hours in F10 medium without serum. Immunoblotting Studies. Cells were lysed in CelLytic\u00a2\u00e2 M reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equal protein of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. After blocking and incubating with primary antibody and then with HRP labeled secondary antibody, immunostains were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), developed by autoradiography and quantified using the 1Dscan Ex gel analysis software (Scanalytics, Rockville, MD). The activation ratio of KIT after TKI treatment was estimated by comparing the densitometry ratio of phospho-KIT/total KIT bands and plotting the percentage of activation relative to untreated control. Considering the diversification of TKIs\u00a1\u00af achievable concentrations in clinical, we compared the inhibitory effects of TKIs on KIT phosphorylation at individual steady-state concentration (Css), and expressed as inhibitory ratio (1 - activation ratio) at Css (IR Css). The Css of IM, SU, nilotinib, dasatinib, and sorafenib at their regular clinical dosing are determined as 1000 (at 400 mg/day), 200 (at 50 mg/day), 1000 (at 400 mg/day), 40 (at 200 mg/day), or 4750 (at 800 mg/day) nM, respectively following the literatures [16]?[20]. Data was expressed as mean \u00a1\u00be S.E. Growth Inhibition Assay. 1\u00a1\u00bf10 4 GIST48 cells were seeded in each well of 24-well plates and then exposed to TKIs for 72 h. The methylene blue dye assay was used to evaluate the relative number of viable cells after TKIs treatment, measured at O.D. 595, and normalized to the DMSO-only control group. The cell viabilities were determined after plotting the percentage of growth relative to untreated control. The survival ratio at the clinically achievable Css of each TKI was estimated from plotted relative cell viabilities. Data was expressed as mean \u00a1\u00be S.E. Molecular Modeling and Docking. Biopolymer module of SYBYL-X (Tripos, St. Louis, MO) was used to introduce single and double mutations into the wild-type structure. Five known KIT crystal structures from Protein Data Bank library were selected as templates (PDB id: 1PKG, 1T45, 1T46, 3G0E, and 3G0F). 1PKG was used as the template for fully active KIT and others as templates for inactive KIT to build the corresponding models for individual TKIs. The mutant models were charged with Gasteiger-Huckel method and minimized using the Amber force field (version 7.0 or FF99) with a steepest descent gradient by a conjugate gradient of 0.025 kcal/mol or a maximum of 50000 iterations as termination criteria [21], [22]. Docking TKIs to the binding site of simulation model was performed by program module Glide in Schrodinger Suite 2011 (Schrodinger, LLC). The GlideScore function in SP mode was used in all docking stages, and the binding energy was deduced from the GlideScore function. Results. Effects of TKIs on KIT with Single Mutation Expressed in COS-1 Cells. We constructed series KIT mutants containing single or double mutations. Single mutations were those commonly observed in clinical samples, including exon 9 Ala502_Tyr503insAlaTyr, exon 11 Val560Asp, 13 Val654Ala, 14 Thr670Ile, and 17 Asp820Gly and Asn822Lys. In addition, one mutant containing frequent deletion region, exon 11 Val555_Leu576del, was also constructed to investigate whether mutants with a substitution or a long segment deletion of exon 11 would respond differently to TKIs. Double mutations were generated a secondary mutant (exon 13 Val654Ala, 14 Thr670Ile, 17 Asp820Gly, and 17 Asn822Lys) on primary mutant (exon 9 Ala502_Tyr503insAlaTyr, 11 Val555_Leu576del, exon 11 Val560Asp), respectively. COS-1 cells expressed these constructs were incubated with each TKI and then analyzed KIT phosphorylation by immunoblotting or luminex assay. IM and SU were firstly used to validate the correlation between the findings from our screening platform and currently clinical data. Other commercially available TKIs, including nilotinib, dasatinib, and sorafenib, were evaluated their inhibitory effects on IM- and/or SU-resistant mutants. IM, SU, and nilotinib could inhibit the phosphorylation of mutant KIT proteins with single exon 9 Ala502_Tyr503insAlaTyr, exon 11 Val555_Leu576del, and exon 11 Val560Asp mutation in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2a-d). IM also inhibited KIT phosphorylation of exon 17 Asp820Gly and exon 17 Asn822Lys mutants, but totally ineffective for exon 13 Val654Ala and exon 14 Thr670Ile mutants. SU, as IM, could inhibit the phosphorylation of exon 17 Asp820Gly and exon 17 Asn822Lys mutants, but only partially effective and totally ineffective for exon 13 Val654Ala and exon 14 Thr670Ile mutants, respectively. On the other hand, nilotinib effectively inhibited all four mutants. Moreover, the effects of imatinib on KIT mutants of exon 9 Ala502_Tyr503insAlaTyr, exon 11 Val555_Leu576del, and exon 11 Val560Asp from luminex assay and immunoblotting were markedly compatible, as Figure S1 shown. Beyond these validations, these results strengthen the reliability of our in vitro cell-based platform. Effects of TKIs on KIT Mutants with Secondary ATP-binding Domain Mutations. We further examined the inhibitory efficacies of TKIs against KIT phosphorylation harboring secondary ATP-binding domain (exon 13 or 14) mutations. Compatible to previous reports, IM was not effective for mutants with secondary exon 13 or 14 mutations (Fig. 3a and 3b). In contrast, SU and sorafenib effectively inhibited KIT phosphorylation of these mutants (Fig. 3a, 3c, and 3f). Nilotinib worked on mutants of exon 11 Val560Asp/13 Val654Ala but totally failed on other secondary exon 13/14 mutants (Fig. 3d). Dasatinib was largely ineffective to inhibit the phosphorylation of KIT with secondary exon 13 or 14 mutations (Fig. 3e). Based on our data, SU had better inhibitory effect on KIT mutants with exon 9 or 11/13 or 14 double mutations than IM, nilotinib, and dasatinib that is consistent with the observation in SU phase III trial and demonstrates that our in vitro cell-based platform is reliable. Moreover, sorafenib showed similar inhibitory effect on these double mutants as SU, even could have better effects on exon 11 Val555_Leu576del/13 Val654Ala and exon 11 Val555_Leu576del/14 Thr670Ile mutants. Effects of TKIs on KIT Mutants with Secondary Activation-loop Domain Mutations. On secondary activation-loop domain (exon 17) mutants, nilotinib had superior inhibitory activity on all 9 or 11/17 mutants than SU (Figs. 4a and 4d). Dasatinib had minor or no inhibitory effect against all exon 9 or 11/17 mutants (Figs. 4a and 4e). Interestingly, sorafenib was actively against the phosphorylation of KIT mutants with secondary exon 17 mutations (Figs. 4a and 4f). Furthermore, GIST48 cells were used to validate the inhibitory efficacies of TKIs whether led to KIT signal cascades downregulation and cell death. Consistent with mutant KIT expressing COS-1 model, at the concentration of their Css, nilotinib and sorafenib showed more potent inhibitory efficacies toward KIT phosphorylation, AKT activation, and cell growth on GIST48 cells than IM, SU, and dasatinib (Figs. 5a?d). Virtual Molecular Modeling/docking Analysis. Based on our in vitro studies, we found that the differential response of doubly mutated KIT to various TKIs. Therefore, molecular modeling of mutated KIT and TKIs docking were used to elucidate the interactions between KIT mutant proteins and TKIs. Previous molecular modeling indicated that single mutations on exon 9, 11, and 13 would cause instability of auto-inhibited KIT conformation and shift the equilibrium toward active conformation. However, a comprehensive molecular modeling for TKIs specificities toward IM-resistant double mutated KIT is rarely described. So we established the molecular model of KIT exon 11 Val555_Leu576del/17 Asp820Gly mutant protein as previous described and trained it using 100 kinase inhibitors. The simulation model showed that combination of a segmental deletion of exon 11 and point mutation on exon 17 resulted in a shift of KIT kinase from inactive form close to fully active form. The dockings of five TKIs onto the ATP-binding site of KIT mutant protein were showed as Fig. 6a and Fig. S2. The binding energies of TKIs to exon 11 Val555_Leu576del/17 Asp820Gly indicated that nilotinib was the most potent inhibitors for exon 11/17 double mutants (Fig. 6b). Discussion. In current study, we used an in vitro KIT expressing COS-1 cell-based system to evaluate the inhibitory efficacy of several commercial available TKIs on phosphorylation of KIT with secondary mutation involving exon 17, and validated the findings on their growth inhibition activity on GIST 48 cells harboring exon 11/17 KIT mutant. In contrast to other in vitro studies, we included a long-segmental exon 11 deletion mutation, exon 11 Val555_Leu576del, in our KIT mutant profile because segmental deletion is a more frequently detected KIT exon 11 mutation and associated with a worse clinical outcome after surgical resection than point mutation detected in advanced GIST [23]. In addition, we evaluated the inhibitory efficacy of TKIs at their clinically achievable Css, IR Css, which made the results can more readily be translated into clinical use. In current study, the IC 50 of TKIs on the phosphorylation of exon 9 or 11/17 mutated KIT proteins was lowest for nilotinib followed by dasatinib, IM, SU, and sorafenib, which were largely comparable with the results in the study of Guo et al. [24]. However, considering the clinically achievable Css of each TKI, we found that nilotinib and sorafenib are more potent TKIs for IM/SU-resistant GISTs with secondary exon 17 mutation. In several recent prospective and retrospective clinical studies as show in Table 1, nilotinib and sorafenib could achieve an overall DCR of 29?47% and 32%-42%, respectively, and a median PFS of 2.0?5.9 months and 4.9?5.2 months, respectively, as compared with that of 11% and 2.1 months in patients receiving best supportive care [25]?[32]. Moreover, a sorafenib analogue, regorafenib, has a broad spectrum of antitumor activity in preclinical and clinical benefit in IM/SU failure GISTs and recently been approved by the FDA as 3 rd-line treatment for IM/SU-refractory GISTs [33]. Unfortunately, little information regarding the KIT genotype of IM/SU-resistant GIST was provided by these studies. As an example, in the series of Sawaki et al., KIT genotyping of post-SU tumor tissue from two patients who achieved either partial response or disease control longer than 24 weeks after nilotinib, showed both tumors carried exon 11/17 double mutation [25]. In addition, the DCR at 24 weeks after nilotinib in patients receiving <6 weeks and >6 weeks of prior SU treatment was 33% and 18%, respectively. Considering the median PFS of IM-resistant GISTs harboring acquired secondary exon 17 mutation was noticeably shorter than that of patients with secondary exon 13/14 mutation, 2.3 months versus 7.8 months. Furthermore, Cauchi et al. found that the IM/SU-resistant GISTs of the only patient with prolonged disease stabilization (>12 moths) after 3 rd-line nilotinib also harbored exon 11/17 double mutation [31]. In a phase II trial of 3 rd-line dasatinib in IM/SU-resistant GISTs, Trent et al. found that patients with PDGFRA Asp842Val mutated GISTs could achieve a better PFS than those with primary KIT mutated tumors [32]. Unfortunately, the genotyping of GIST resistant to IM and SU was not available in the report of 3 rd-line sorafenib trials [26]?[28]. Taken together, these evidences support our findings that nilotinib may be a better agent for IM-resistant GIST with secondary exon 17 mutation than SU. Furthermore, we also introduced molecular modeling to elucidate the interaction between TKIs and mutant KIT proteins. Previous study of Mol et al. first resolved the crystal structure of KIT and its phosphorylation status [34]. The molecular modeling of Mahadevan et al. showed that IM could not bind to Val654Ala mutant and explained the impact of KIT mutations on IM resistance [35]. In this study, we found that nilotinib had the best binding affinity for exon 11/17 (Fig. 6b), which is in consistent with our in vitro inhibitory efficacy study on KIT mutants. On the other hand, although the affinity of sorafenib to exon 11 Val555_Leu576del/17 Asp820Gly mutant was intermediate in the molecular modeling study, the extremely high Css of sorafenib compared to other TKIs also contributes to effective inhibition on KIT exon 11/17 mutant. These findings pinpoint the importance of evaluating TKIs\u00a1\u00af inhibitory efficacy on KIT at their Css rather than at equal concentration. In conclusion, based on the clinical observation of potential risk of rapid progression in IM-refractory GISTs with secondary KIT exon 17 mutation receiving SU, we established a screening platform to evaluate and to compare the inhibitory activity of several commercially available TKIs on KIT activation at their clinically achievable Css for selecting optimal treatment for such patient population. The results indicate that nilotinib and sorafenib could more effectively inhibit the phosphorylation of KIT mutant with secondary exon 17 mutations in COS-1 model and the growth of GIST48 cells than IM and SU, which were supported by a molecular modeling study. An investigator-initiated, explorative randomization trials comparing either nilotinib or sorafenib against SU in IM-refractory, secondary KIT exon 17 mutation-enriched patient population is currently under discussion.

                "text": "Inhibition of FLT3 Expression by Green Tea Catechins in FLT3 Mutated-AML Cells\tAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by a block in differentiation and uncontrolled proliferation. FLT3 is a commonly mutated gene found in AML patients. In clinical trials, the presence of a FLT3-ITD mutation significantly correlates with an increased risk of relapse and dismal overall survival. Therefore, activated FLT3 is a promising molecular target for AML therapies. In this study, we have shown that green tea polyphenols including (?)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), (?)-epigallocatechin (EGC), and (?)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) suppress the proliferation of AML cells. Interestingly, EGCG, EGC and ECG showed the inhibition of FLT3 expression in cell lines harboring FLT3 mutations. In the THP-1 cells harboring FLT3 wild-type, EGCG showed the suppression of cell proliferation but did not suppress the expression of FLT3 even at the concentration that suppress 100% cell proliferation. Moreover, EGCG-, EGC-and ECG-treated cells showed the suppression of MAPK, AKT and STAT5 phosphorylation. Altogether, we suggest that green tea polyphenols could serve as reagents for treatment or prevention of leukemia harboring FLT3 mutations. Introduction. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of adult leukemia, affecting mostly elder people and its incidence increases with the age. It is an aggressive disease that involves rapid growth of abnormal leukemic cells in the bone marrow, resulting in failure of production of normal blood cells [1]. FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) is a commonly mutated gene found in AML patients with the approximately 5?30% of the cases of AML [2]. FLT3 is one of the members of the subclass III of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) family and is normally expressed on the cell surface of hematopoietic progenitor cells but expression is lost upon cell maturation [3]. A very high expression of FLT3 has been found in around 70?100% AML patients that usually associate with a worse prognosis [4], [5]. FLT3 mutations are predominantly detected in juxtamembrane domain (JMD) [6] and in tyrosine kinase domains (TKD) including the in-frame internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITDs) [6], the point mutation [2], [7] and the insertion of six bases [8]. FLT3-ITDs have been found mostly in JMD [6] and few cases in TKD [9] with the approximation of 15?35% of AML [2], [10], [11], [12], whereas FLT3 point mutations was predominantly found in activation loop of TKD (at D835 [7] and I836 position [2]) but rare in JMD [13] with approximately 5?10% of AML patients [2], [10], [11], [12]. The last mutation form was the insertion of a glycine and a serine between amino acids 840 and 841 of FLT3 [8]. FLT3 mutations result in a ligand-independent receptor dimerization, phosphorylation and constitutive activation of downstream signaling molecules including the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK kinases, PI3-kinase and STAT5 kinases [14], [15], [16], [17]. In clinical, the presence of a FLT3-ITD mutation significantly correlates with an increased risk of relapse and dismal overall survival with the median survival after the first relapse has been reported to be \u00a1\u00c25 months [18], [19]. Therefore, activated FLT3 is a promising molecular target for AML therapies. Currently, several small molecule FLT3-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FLT3-TKIs) have been developed and examined in AML patients as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy. Up to now, six oral FLT3 inhibitors, including CEP-701, PKC412, BAY 43-9006, SU11248, MLN-518 and KW-2449, the i.v. compound SU5416 and AC220 have been investigated as monotherapy in clinical trials. In addition, FLT3-directed antibody therapy (IMC-EB10) is currently being investigated in a phase 1 clinical trial. FLT3-TKI monotherapy has been proven to efficiently target FLT3-mutated AML blasts [20]. However, approval of these agents for FLT3-associated diseases is still challenging, which was suspected to be due to the failure to fully inhibit FLT3 in tumors and undesirable drug properties [21]. In this study, we evaluated the anti-cancer effect of green tea polyphenols including (?)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), (?)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (?)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), and (+)-Catechin (C) in a group of AML cell lines harboring FLT3 mutation. It is well documented that polyphenols of green tea show anti-cancer effects on many types of human malignancies, but not to their normal counterpart [22]. Currently, green tea is now developing as a cancer preventive drug in the USA and Europe [23], [24]. Our results show that EGCG, EGC and ECG treatment disrupts the association of Hsp90 with FLT3-ITD and results in reduced levels of FLT3 expression in AML harboring mutated FLT3. Materials and Methods. 2.1. Cell Lines, Culture Conditions. Experiments were conducted using four human leukemia cell lines: two sister cell lines MOLM-13 and MOLM-14 that were established from a patient with acute monocytic leukemia (M5a) harboring t(9;11) [25]; MV4-11 from a patient with AML carrying t(4;11) [26] and KOCL-48 from an infant leukemic patient carrying t(4;11) [27]. In MOLM-13 and MOLM-14 cells, two mutations within FLT3 exon 14 were detected: ITD of 21 bps corresponding to codons Phe594-Asp600 and a novel missense nucleotide substitution at the codon 599 (Tyr599Phe) [28], [29]. Two kinds of mutations were located on the same allele [29]. In MV4-11 cells, there are an ITDs of 30 bps within FLT3 exon 14 corresponding to codons Tyr591-Asp600, and a Tyr591His mutation [28], [29]. In KOCL-48 cell line, only FLT3-Asp835Glu mutation was detected [28]. The cell line THP-1 came from the peripheral blood of a one-year old infant male with monocytic AML [30]. They do not contain a known FLT3 mutation and have high endogenous wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) expression. THP-1 cells will be used as a negative control in this study. The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Japan K.K., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS, USA), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) in a humidified incubator of 5% CO 2 at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. 2.2. Reagents. Reagents were obtained as follows: EGCG, EGC, ECG, and C (purified powder) were generously gifted by one of us Dr. Yukihiko Hara (Japan), PKC412 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Japan K.K. (Tokyo, Japan) and 17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) was purchased from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). All reagents were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Wako Pure. Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Controlled cells were cultured with the same concentration of carrier DMSO as used in the highest dose of reagents. The concentration of DMSO was kept under 0.1% throughout all the experiments to avoid its cytotoxicity. 2.3. Cell Proliferation Assays. Cell proliferation was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion test as described previously [31]. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1\u00a1\u00bf10 5 cells/ml in the presence of different concentrations of EGCG, EGC, ECG and C for 72 hours. After the treatment, 10 \u00a5\u00ecl of the cell suspension was mixed with 10 \u00a5\u00ecl of 0.4% trypan blue, and alive cells were counted manually using a hemacytometer. Results were calculated as the percentage of the values measured when cells were grown in the absence of reagents. 2.4. Western Blot Analysis. Cells were plated onto 10 cm dishes at a density of 1\u00a1\u00bf10 5 cells/ml in the presence of various concentrations of reagents. After incubation for indicated durations, cells were collected and washed twice with PBS (?). Cells were then dissolved in a protein lysis buffer containing 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Na 2H 2P 2O 7, 0.01% Triton X-100, 5 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na 3VO 4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 75 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL aprotinin on ice for 30 min with brief vortex of 4 times with every 10 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4\u00a1\u00c6C for 10 min, total cell lysates were collected. Protein samples were electrophoresed through a polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Hypond-P membrane (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) by electro-blotting. After washing, the membrane was probed with antibodies and antibody-binding was detected using BCIP/NBT substrate (Promega). The following antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA): FLT-3/FLK-2 (S-18) (sc-480), STAT5 (C-17) (sc-835) and survivin (sc-17779). Anti-actin (A2066) was from Sigma-Aldrich. p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), AKT, phospho-AKT (Ser473), phospho-STAT5 (Tyr694), caspase-3, caspase-9 (C9) and XIAP antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Anti-PARP antibody was from WAKO Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). 2.5. Co-immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation (IP), MOLM-13 cells were treated with EGCG, EGC or ECG for 8 hours and then harvested. Cells were lysed as indicated above. Then, 500 \u00a5\u00ecg of protein total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Hsp90 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan) was then added for 2 hours. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Tris buffered saline-Tween. The bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. 2.6. Determination of Apoptosis. MOLM-14 cells were treated with EGCG, EGC or ECG for 16 hours. The apoptotic cell was evaluated by PE Annexin V (BD PharMingen) and analyzed by FACS Calibur (Becton, Dickinson). Collected data were analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star). 2.7. Isobologram. The dose-response interactions between EGCG and PKC412 on the MOLM-13, MOLM-14, MV4-11 and KOCL-48 cells were evaluated at the IC 50 level by the isobologram of Steel and Peckham [32]. The IC 50 was defined as the concentration of the reagent that produced 50% cell growth inhibition. The concept of the isobologram has been described in detail elsewhere [32]. We used this isobologram because this method can cope with any agents with unclear cytotoxic mechanisms and a variety of dose-response curves of anticancer agents [32]. 2.8. Statistical Analysis. Data for isobologram were analyzed as described elsewhere [33]. When the observed data points of the combinations mainly fell in the area of supraadditivity or in the areas of subadditivity and protection, i.e., the mean value of the observed data was smaller than that of the predicted minimum values or larger than that of the predicted maximum values, the combinations were considered to have a synergistic or antagonistic effect, respectively. To determine whether the condition of synergism (or antagonism) truly existed, a statistical analysis was performed. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used for comparing the observed data with the predicted minimum (or maximum) values for additive effects, which were closest to the observed data. Probability (P) values <0.05 were considered significant. Combinations with P\u00a1\u00c30.05 were regarded as indicating additive to synergistic (or additive to antagonistic) effects. The other data were analyzed by Student\u00a1\u00afs t test. Results. 3.1. Growth-inhibitory Effect of EGCG, EGC, ECG and C on FLT3 Mutated-AML Cells. To test the inhibitory effect of EGCG, EGC, ECG and C on the growth of AML cell lines, MOLM13, MOLM14, MV4-11 and KOCL-48 cells were incubated either with the carrier DMSO alone (control) or with different concentrations of reagents for 72 hours. Cell proliferations were evaluated using the trypan blue exclusion test. The result showed that EGCG, EGC and ECG significantly inhibited the cell proliferation of MOLM-13, MOLM-14, MV4-11 and KOCL-48 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A, B and C). Whereas, the growth-inhibition effect of (+)-Catechin on these cells was less sensitive than others (Figure 1D). Altogether, green tea polyphenols showed the anti-proliferation effects on AML cells. 3.2. Down-regulation of FLT3 Expression and its Downstream Molecules in EGCG-Treated AML Cells. To address the mechanism of the EGCG-mediated growth inhibition in FLT3 mutated-AML cells, we analyzed the expression of FLT3 protein in these cells treated with or without EGCG by western blotting. Interestingly, the expression level of FLT3 protein was significantly decreased after 8 hours exposure of MOLM-13, MOLM-14, MV4-11 and KOCL-48 cells (FLT3 mutated cells) to different concentrations of EGCG (Fig. 2, the first row). However, In THP-1 cells (FLT3-WT cells), the level of FLT3 expression did not change even at high EGCG concentration treatment (180 \u00a5\u00ecM) (Fig. 2, the first row). The data suggested that EGCG specifically targets mutant FLT3 rather than wild-type FLT3. We reasoned that the down-regulation of FLT3 expression would lead to inhibition of its activity, subsequently suppress the activity of its down-stream molecules. To make it clear, we measured the activity of MAPK, AKT and STAT5 in MOLM-13, MOLM-14, MV4-11, KOCL-48 and THP-1 cells treated with or without EGCG. The inhibitions of MAPK, AKT and STAT5 activity (p-MARK, p-AKT and p-STAT5) were observed in MOLM-13, MOLM-14, MV4-11 and KOCL-48 cells after 8 hours incubation with EGCG (Fig. 2). Although EGCG caused the suppression of cell growth in THP-1 cells (IC 50 ? 60 \u00a5\u00ecM EGCG, Fig. 1A), only activity of MAPK but not AKT and STAT5 was decreased at very high concentration of EGCG (180 \u00a5\u00ecM) (Fig. 2). 3.3. Down-regulation of FLT3 Expression and its Downstream Molecules in EGC- and ECG-treated AML Cells. To check whether EGC and ECG suppress the expression of FLT3, MOLM-13, MOLM-14, MV4-11 and KOCL-48 cells were treated with 100 \u00a5\u00ecM EGC or 100 or 200 \u00a5\u00ecM ECG for 8 hours. Western blot was performed to analyze the expression of FLT3. EGC-treated cells showed not only the suppression of FLT3, but also the suppression of phosphorylation of MAPK, AKT and STAT5 (Fig. 3). Similarly, the suppression of FLT3 expression and phosphorylation of its downstream molecules were also observed in ECG-treated cells (Fig. 4). 3.4. EGCG, EGC and ECG Suppressed FLT3 Expression through Hsp90. EGCG has been demonstrated to be an inhibitor of Hsp-90 [34]. Moreover, recently FLT3-ITD but not FLT3-WT has been shown as a client protein of Hsp-90 [35], [36]. Thus it could be assumed that mutant FLT3 expression is suppressed by EGCG treatment might through inhibition of Hsp-90. To confirm this hypothesis, total cell lysates of MOLM-13 and THP-1 cells after EGCG treatment were collected and immunoprecipitated with indicated anti-body as shown in Figure 5A. The results of immunoprecipitation showed that only FLT3-ITD could physically interact with Hsp-90 but not FLT-WT (Fig. 5A lane 3 and 5). In addition, EGCG treatment disrupts the association of Hsp90 with FLT3-ITD and results in reduced levels of FLT3 expression (Fig. 5A lane 4). Similar results are observed in EGC-, and ECG-treated MOLM-13 cells (Fig. 5B) suggesting that mechanism of EGC and ECG on suppression of FLT3 expression might through inhibit the activity of Hsp-90. 3.5. EGCG, EGC and ECG Induced Apoptosis in FLT3 Mutated-AML Cells. Next, we demonstrated that EGCG, EGC and ECG induced apoptosis in FLT3 mutated cell lines. We have checked the appearance of some apoptotic markers in MOLM-14 cells after EGCG, EGC or ECG treatment by western blot. The bands of cleaved-caspase-9, cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-PARP were observed after 8 hours incubated with EGCG, EGC or ECG (Fig. 6A). Moreover, EGCG, EGC or ECG treatment showed the inhibition of the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules such as survivin and XIAP in MOLM-14 cells (Fig. 6A). The results from PE-Annexin V staining that shown in figure 6B indicated that EGCG, EGC and ECG induce apoptosis in MOLM-14 cells treated with EGCG, EGC or ECG. Overall, the EGCG-, EGC- or ECG- induced cell death in MOLM-14 is apoptosis. 3.6. Cytotoxic Effects of EGCG in Combination with PKC412. EGCG is one of the most studied polyphenol of green tea and shows the strongest anti-cancer effect compared to other polyphenols of green tea (Fig. 1). In this study, we evaluated the combination effect of EGCG and PKC412. Interestingly, the results showed that the combination of EGCG and PKC412 treatment strongly suppressed cell growth in MOLM-13, KOCL-48, MV4-11 and MOLM-14 cells compared to EGCG or PKC412 treatment (Fig. 7). However, the combined effects of simultaneous exposure to these drugs differed among MOLM-13, MOLM-14 and KOCL-48, MV4-11 cell lines. In MOLM-13 and MOLM-14 cells, the combined data points fell within the envelope of additivity. The mean value of the data (0.423 and 0.414 respectively) was larger than that of the predicted minimum data (0.379 and 0.121 respectively) and smaller than that of the predicted maximum data for an additive effect (0.766 and 0.549 respectively; Table 1), indicating that simultaneous exposure to EGCG and PKC412 produced an additive effect. In KOCL-48 and MV4-11 cells, the combined data points fell mainly in the area of subadditivity, and the mean values of the observed data (0.887 and 0.803 respectively) were larger than those of the predicted maximum additive data (0.410 and 0.579 respectively; Table 1) which were regarded as antagonism effect. Discussion. It is well documented that polyphenols of green tea, used as a beverage for over 5,000 years, have anti-cancer effects on many types of human malignancies, but not to their normal counterpart [22]. So far, we have demonstrated that EGCG suppressed the cell proliferation and caused apoptotic cell death in GIST cells by inhibition of KIT activity [31]. In this work, we have reported that polyphenols of green tea caused apoptotic cell death in FLT3-mutated cell lines (Fig. 6) by suppressing the expression of FLT3 and ultimately suppressing the activity of AKT, MAPK and STAT5 (Fig. 2, ?,33 and ?and44). Recent studies indicated that RTKs are one of the critical targets of EGCG to inhibit cancer cell growth. The previous studies provided evidences that EGCG inhibited the activation or expression of some RTKs including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [37], human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), HER3 [38], [39], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) [40], platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) [41], fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) [37], insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) [42], [43] and KIT [31]. In this report, we showed that EGCG, EGC and ECG suppressed the FLT3 expression (Fig. 2, ?,33 and ?and4)4) in cell lines harboring FLT3 mutation but not in THP-1 cells that carrying FLT3 wild-type. One of the hypothesizes that can be explains for the difference effect of EGCG on FLT3 WT and FLT3 mutant expression would be through the mediator heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Hsp90, a highly abundant molecular chaperone in the stress response, assists maturation of more than 200 proteins, which include transmembrane tyrosine kinases (Her-2, EGFR), metastable signaling proteins (Akt, K-ras, Raf-1), mutated signaling proteins (p53, v-Src), chimeric signaling proteins (Bcr-Abl), cell cycle regulators (Cdk4, Cdk6), and steroid receptors (androgen, estrogen, and progesterone receptors) [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]. Both the N- and C-terminal domain of Hsp90 contains specific ATP binding pockets [49], [50]. Hsp90 dimerizes through its C-terminal end. Upon ATP binding, the two N-termini of the dimer associate to form a molecular \u00a1\u00b0clamp\u00a1\u00b1 with a client protein to exert its chaperone function [51], [52]. Previous studies show that FLT3-ITD but not FLT3-WT is a client protein of Hsp90 in murine tranfected 32D cell lines [35] and primary AML cells [36]. Recently, EGCG has been demonstrated as inhibitor of Hsp90. EGCG acts by binding at or near a C-terminal ATP binding site to inhibit dimerization and promote an Hsp90 conformation that interferes with its chaperone activity for a client protein [34]. In the same year, another group also reported that EGCG inhibits Hsp90 function by impairing Hsp90 association with cochaperones including Hsc70 and p23 in pancreatic cancer cell line Mia Paca-2 [53]. In 2010, Tran et al. reported that in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, EGCG specifically inhibited the expression of Hsp90 by inhibiting the promoter activity of Hsp90. However, in this study, we did not observed the decrease of Hsp90 expression after 8 hours treated MOLM-13, MOLM-14, MV4-11, KOCL-48 and THP-1 cells with 60 \u00a5\u00ecM EGCG (data not shown). We hypothesized that the suppression of mutant-FLT3 expression by EGCG could be mediated through Hsp90, we confirmed this hypothesis in figure 5A. Base on these confirming data, we explained why EGCG just exerted its inhibition effect on FLT3-ITD but not FLT3-WT. Moreover, we at the first time suggest that others polyphenols including EGC and ECG might also suppressed FLT3 expression through inhibition of Hsp90 function by the same way as EGCG did (Fig. 5B). One of the effective strategies for treating AML patients with FLT3 mutations is combination of drugs that have different mechanism of pharmaceutical action. In this study, we combined EGCG with PKC412 to check their combination effect on FLT3 mutated cell lines. The concentration of both two drugs are significantly reduced (Fig. 7) compared with EGCG alone or PKC412 alone. For examples, the IC 50 of EGCG alone for MOLM-13 cells was 15 \u00a5\u00ecM, however, when combined with PKC412, the concentration of EGCG will reduce to 10 \u00a5\u00ecM (with 5nM PKC412) and even 5 \u00a5\u00ecM (with 7nM PKC412). Similarly, the IC 50 of PKC412 alone for MOLM-13 cells was 20nM, however, when combined with EGCG, the concentration of PKC412 will remarkably reduce to 5nM (with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM EGCG). It is important to note that green tea is now developing as a cancer preventive drug in the USA and Europe [23], [24]. It suggests that polyphenols of green tea could be promising candidates for treatment of AML or for combination with other drugs such as FLT3 inhibitors to improve the treatment efficacy.

                "text": "DOG1 regulates growth and IGFBP-5 in gastrointestinal stromal tumors\tGastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are characterized by activating mutations of KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) which can be therapeutically targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib. Despite long lasting responses most patients eventually progress after TKI therapy. The calcium-dependent chloride channel DOG1 (ANO1/TMEM16A), which is strongly and specifically expressed in GIST, is used as a diagnostic marker to differentiate GIST from other sarcomas. Here we report that loss of DOG1 expression occurs together with loss of KIT expression in a subset of GIST resistant to KIT inhibitors, and we illustrate the functional role of DOG1 in tumor growth, KIT expression and imatinib response. While DOG1 is a crucial regulator of chloride balance in GIST cells, we found that RNAi-mediated silencing or pharmacological inhibition of DOG1 did not alter cell growth or KIT signaling in vitro. In contrast, DOG1 silencing delayed the growth of GIST xenografts in vivo. Expression profiling of explanted tumors after DOG1 blockade revealed a strong upregulation in the expression of IGFBP5, a potent antiangiogenic factor implicated in tumor suppression. Similar results were obtained after selection of imatinib-resistant DOG1- and KIT-negative cells derived from parental DOG1 and KIT-positive GIST cells, where a 5000-fold increase in IGFBP5 mRNA transcripts were documented. In summary, our findings establish the oncogenic activity of DOG1 in GIST involving modulation of IGF/IGFR signaling in the tumor microenvironment through the antiangiogenic factor IGFBP5. Introduction. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and are characterized by activating mutations in the KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) genes (1?3). Imatinib (IM) is a small molecule inhibitor of several oncogenic tyrosine kinases, including KIT and PDGFRA. About 85% of patients with metastatic GIST derive substantial clinical benefit from IM treatment, however, imatinib does not cure metastatic GIST and the majority of patients eventually progress. Secondary, imatinib-resistant KIT mutations within the ATP-binding and activation loop domain are commonly found in IM-resistant GIST and are believed to be the major mechanism of resistance (4?7). The protein DOG1 (Discovered on GIST-1) encoded by ANO1 (also known as TMEM16A) is a calcium-dependent chloride channel (CaCC) (8?10). Calcium-dependent chloride channels are involved in diverse physiological processes including gastrointestinal rhythmic contractions [11, 12]. Notably, DOG1 was found to be highly expressed both in GIST (13) and in ICC (interstitial cells of Cajal), the putative cell-of-origin of GIST [14, 15]. In clinical practice, DOG1 is a sensitive immunohistochemical marker for GIST and is preserved in 36% of GIST that lack KIT expression or activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA (16?18). However, DOG1 biologic functions have not been characterized in GIST. In order to shed light on the relevance of DOG1 for GIST tumorigenesis, we evaluated the impact of DOG1 expression and activity in various GIST models, both in vitro and in vivo. Material and Methods. Cell lines. GIST-T1 and GIST882 were established from human, untreated, metastatic GISTs. GIST-T1 contains a 57bp deletion in c-KIT exon 11 (19). GIST882 harbors a homozygous exon 13 missense mutation, resulting in a single amino acid substitution, K642E (20). GIST48 and GIST430 were established from GIST that had progressed, after initial clinical response, during IM therapy. GIST48 has a primary, homozygous exon 11 missense mutation (V560D) and a heterozygous secondary exon 17 (kinase activation loop) mutation (D820A). GIST430 has a primary heterozygous exon 11 in-frame deletion and a heterozygous secondary exon 13 missense mutation. GIST882B, GIST48B and GIST430B are sublines which, despite retaining the activating KIT mutation in all cells, expresses KIT transcript and protein at essentially undetectable levels. GIST62 was derived from an untreated KIT-positive GIST with KIT exon 11 in-frame mutation, but the cell line, despite retaining the activating KIT mutation in all cells, expresses KIT transcript and protein at essentially undetectable levels (21). GIST5 and GIST474 were established from imatinib-treated GISTs, and lacked KIT expression in the primary and subsequent cultures, although they retain the KIT exon 11 mutations of the parental GIST population. Stable shRNA transfection. shRNA lentivirus for human DOG1 ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NM_018043\",\"term_id\":\"194306538\",\"term_text\":\"NM_018043\"}}NM_018043) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (MISSION\u00a2\u00e7 shRNA Lentiviral Transduction Particles TRCN0000040263). GIST cells were grown to 80% confluence and then infected with 1 MOI (multiplicity of infection) of either non-targeting scrambled shRNA (SHC002V) control particles or DOG1 shRNA lentiviral particles in medium containing 8\u00a5\u00ecg/ml polybrene. Fresh medium containing 4\u00a5\u00ecg/ml puromycin was added after 48h to select for puromycin-resistant cells. Reagents and Antibodies. Imatinib mesylate (IM) was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX USA). 17-N-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) was purchased from Calbiochem (Merck, Darmstadt Germany). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against KIT was from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA USA) and a monoclonal rabbit antibody against DOG1 was from Diagnostic BioSystems (Pleasanton, CA USA). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies for phospho-KIT Y703 were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA USA). B-Actin Antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO USA). In vitro assays.  BrdU incorporation assay. Cells were incubated with 1 mM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 2,5h (GIST-T1) or 24h (GIST882) at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and processed using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) BrdU Flow Kit (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1,5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 trypsinized cells were fixed, permeabilized, and digested with DNAse. Cells were then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU and 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) followed immediately by flow cytometric analysis. Ten thousand events of each sample were acquired on a Beckman Coulter FC500 Flow Cytometer. SRB. The sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay was used according to the method of Skehan (22). Cells were plated in 96-well flat-bottomed plates. After 24h culture medium was replaced with fresh medium (with or without respective drugs) in triplicate or quadruplicate cultures. At the end of drug exposure (72h), cells were fixed for 1h and stained with 0.4% SRB (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO USA) and the optical density was detected at 560nm. Each experiment was repeated three times and Figures depict a representative result. The specific DOG1 inhibitor A01 was kindly provided by Prof. Alan Verkman (University of California, San Francisco). Whole cell patch-clamp. Whole-cell membrane currents were recorded in GIST-T1 and GIST882 cell lines. The extracellular (bath) solution had the following composition: 150mM NaCl, 1mM CaCl2, 1mM MgCl2, 10mM glucose, 10mM mannitol, 10mM Na-HEPES (pH = 7.4). The pipette (intracellular) solution contained 130mM CsCl, 10mM EGTA, 1mM MgCl2, 10mM HEPES, 1mM ATP (pH 7.4) plus CaCl2 to obtain the desired free Ca2 + concentration: 8mM for 305nM (calculated with Patcher\u00a1\u00afs Power Tool developed by Dr. Francisco Mendes and Franz Wurriehausen, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany). During experiments, the membrane capacitance and series resistance were analogically compensated using the circuitry provided by the EPC7 patch-clamp amplifier. The usual protocol for stimulation consisted of 600ms-long voltage steps from ?100 to 100mV in 20mV increments starting from a holding potential of ?60mV. The waiting time between steps was 4s. Membrane currents were filtered at 1kHz and digitized at 5kHz with an ITC-16 (Instrutech) AD/DA converter. Data were analyzed using the Igor software (Wavemetrics) supplemented by custom software kindly provided by Dr. Oscar Moran. Western blotting. Whole cell protein lysates were prepared from cell line monolayers according to standard protocols (23). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA USA). Proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE as described by Laemmli (24) and transferred to Hybond P membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala Sweden). Changes in protein expression and phosphorylation as visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL chemiluminescent reagent, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala Sweden) were captured and quantified using a FUJI LAS3000 system with Science Lab 2001 ImageGauge 4.0 software (Fujifilm Medial Systems, Stamford CT, USA). In vivo studies. Tumor growth in vivo was evaluated by subcutaneously injecting the rear flanks of 6- to 8-wk old female adult athymic nude mice (NMRI nu/nu) with 10 million cells/per flank transfected with scrambled or DOG1 shRNA. Tumor growth was monitored biweekly with a caliper and tumor volumes were calculated by [(length \u00a1\u00bf width 2) / 2]. The experiment was stopped, mice were sacrificed and tumors were harvested when controls reached app. 1 cm 3. Statistical analysis of the mean tumor volumes was done by pairwise comparison using one-tailed homoscedastic t-test analysis. Immunhistochemical staining. Four micrometer sections of paraffin-embedded tissues of xenograft samples were cut and mounted onto SuperFrost \u00a2\u00e7 Plus coated slides (Langenbrinck, Emmerdingen, Germany) for immunohistochemical staining. Heat-induced antigen retrieval (waterbath) was carried out with Target Retrieval Solution Citrate buffer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at pH 6.0 or HIER T-EDTA buffer (Zytomed Systems, Berlin, Germany) at pH 9.0. Specimens were stained with a monoclonal rabbit anti-DOG1 (IgG; clone, SP31; dilution,1:100; 20 min, pH 6.0, Zytomed Systems, No. 504-3315), a monoclonal anti-Ki-67 (IgG1; clone, K-2; dilution,1:2000; 30 min, pH 6.0, Zytomed Systems, No. MSK018) and a polyclonal anti-KIT antibody (dilution 1:200; 20 min, pH 9.0, Zytomed Systems, No. RP063) together with a highly sensitive and specific polymer detection system utilizing horseradish peroxidase (ZytoChem-Plus HRP Polymer Kit, Zytomed Systems). The process for development was performed using a permanent brown chromogenic substrate system (Permanent AEC Kit, Zytomed Systems). Finally, nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin for 5min. RNA isolation and Microarray Gene Expression Profiling. Total RNA of cell line monolayers and tumor samples were isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Residual traces of genomic DNA were removed with DNase I (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA concentration and purity were determined photometrically (NanoDrop, Thermo scientific, Waltham, MA USA). Preparation of cRNA targets (5 \u00a5\u00ecg total RNA), fragmentation, hybridization of HG-U133 plus 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), washing, staining, and scanning were performed according to manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) by the BioChip-Labor (Dr. Klein-Hitpass, Institute for Cell Biology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany). Signal intensities and detection calls were determined using Affymetrix microarray suite, version 5.0. Comparison files were further filtered to detect differentially expressed genes. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RNA extraction was performed as described above and cDNA synthesis was performed using the RevertAid\u00a2\u00e2 H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA USA). qRT?PCR was carried out using TaqMan \u00a2\u00e7 chemistry on the Roche LightCycler\u00a2\u00e7 480 (Roche, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany) using the standard curve method in triplicate, as previously described (25). Probes for DOG1 (Hs00216121_m1), LTN1 (listerin E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, ID: Hs00391630_m1), MNK1 (MAP kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase 1, ID: Hs00374376_m1), CDC14A (CDC14 cell division cycle 14 homolog A, ID: Hs00186432_m1), DDX17 (DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 17, ID: Hs00428757_m1), IGFBP5 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5, ID: Hs00181213_m1), EPHA4 (EPH receptor A4, ID: Hs00177874) and CDKN1C (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C, ID: Hs00175938_m1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems (all FAM-labelled). Expression levels of the housekeeping gene beta-Actin (hs99999903_m1, FAM labelled) were assessed for normalization. Whole transcriptome sequencing. rRNA was depleted from 5\u00a5\u00ecg of total RNA using biotinylated oligonucleotides (Ribominus, Invitrogen), and libraries were constructed from the rRNA-depleted RNA according to the SOLiD Total RNA-seq Kit Protocol (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, library construction involved fragmentation of the RNA by RNAse III to an average size of 150 bases, ligation of the fragmented RNA to adaptors in a directed orientation, then cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification of the resulting library. Approximately 50 bases were sequenced from one end of each fragment using either the SOLiD 3+ or SOLiD 4 instrument and reagents (Applied Biosystems). The resulting sequence data was mapped to the human reference genome, hg18, using Bioscope v1.2 (Applied Biosystems). Sequences that mapped to unique locations were quantified per transcriptional unit, defined as \"reads per kilobase of transcript per megabase of total sequence (RPKM).\u00a1\u00b1 A weighted score, described by the following expression: was used to rank the difference in reads for each transcript between samples. Results. KIT and DOG1 are coexpressed in KIT-positive versus KIT-negative GIST cell lines. Whole transcriptome sequencing analyses of KIT-positive parental KIT cell lines and KIT-negative sublines showed a 47 to 157-fold reduction of KIT and a 7 to 77-fold reduction of DOG1 sequencing counts, suggestive of a coregulation (Figure 1A). Immunoblot studies confirm this observation with an 83 to 99-fold reduction of DOG1 protein levels in KIT-negative GISTs (Figure 1B). Direct (IM) or indirect (17-AAG) pharmacologic inhibition of KIT did not abolish DOG1 expression (Figure 1C). DOG1 knockdown does not affect KIT expression, cell proliferation or IM sensitivity of GIST cells in vitro. To investigate the biological role of DOG1 in GIST, GIST-T1 and GIST882 cells were transduced with lentiviral particles carrying shRNAs against DOG1 (Sequence: CCGGCGTCGAGTTCAACGACAGAAACTCGAGTTTCTGTCGTTGAACTCGACGTTTTTG). This resulted in a 91% reduction of DOG1 protein levels while nonsense shRNA (scrambled) treatment did not alter DOG1 expression. Expression and activation of KIT and KIT-dependent signaling pathways was not altered by DOG1 knockdown (Figure 2A). Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were carried out in order to confirm the functional effect of DOG1 reduction on chloride currents. Notably, DOG1 knockdown resulted in a 96% inhibition of chloride efflux in GIST-T1 and 90% in GIST882 compared to the controls, underscoring that DOG1 is a crucial regulator of GIST cell chlorine balance (Figure 2B). To assess the impact of DOG1 knockdown on cell proliferation we performed Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays. Suppression of DOG1 did not significantly alter the proliferation of GIST-T1 and GIST882 cells in vitro (Figure 2C). Moreover, IM sensitivity was maintained in both cell lines despite DOG1 knockdown, with IC50 values of 20nM and 50nM for GIST-T1 and GIST882 (Figure 2D). Biochemical inhibitors of CaCCs do not affect GIST cell growth in vitro. To further explore the functional impact of the DOG1 CaCC on GIST survival, GIST-T1 and GIST882 cells were treated for three days with three biochemical inhibitors of CaCCs, niflumic acid (NAC), 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) and A01 (being most specific for DOG1). At active concentrations (26) none of these CaCC inhibitors significantly reduced cell viability. The inhibition of GIST-T1 by A01 at 10\u00a5\u00ecM (34%) was seen in both DOG1 knockdown and control cells and is therefore not a DOG1-specific effect (Figure 3). Taken together, these findings argue against a cell-autonomous activity of DOG1 in GIST biology. DOG1 knockdown inhibits growth of GIST xenografts in nude mice. As DOG1 might be involved tumor-host interactions in GIST, we next investigated the effect of DOG1 knockdown on tumor growth of GIST-T1, GIST882 and GIST430 in vivo. As shown in Figure 4, DOG1 knockdown effectively suppressed DOG1 in all xenograft models (exemplified for GIST-T1 and GIST882) while xenografts from parental cells (no lentiviral transduction) and control cells (expressing scrambled shRNA) retained DOG1 expression as measured by immunoblot (Figure 4A) and immunohistochemistry (Figure 4B). Interestingly, GIST-T1 tumors with DOG1 knockdown had lower proliferative activity (Ki-67: 60% positive cells in knockdown tumors versus 90% in control tumors) resulting in a significant reduction (mean 43%) of tumor size after 19 days (n=8; p=0.003) compared to controls (Figure 4C). A substantial growth delay (mean 31%) was also observed in GIST430, which exhibits an intrinsically slower tumor growth compared to GIST-T1. Notably, DOG1 knockdown did not alter the growth of GIST882 xenografts. Analysis of gene expression data suggests IGFBP5 regulation by DOG1. In order to better understand the molecular consequences of DOG1 knockdown we performed expression arrays using Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 arrays containing 54,675 probe sets representing more than 24,568 human genes. Changes in expression were found in more than 1,500 genes after DOG1 knockdown in cell lines and in more than >3,500 genes after DOG1 knockdown in xenografts when compared with controls. As expected, DOG1 (ANO1) was among the top ranking differentially expressed genes. Other genes with strong differential expression are shown in Figure 5 and suppl. table 1 and 2. Comprehensive pathway analyses were performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). For those, a fold-change cutoff was set at \u00a1\u00c31 to identify genes whose expression was significantly differentially up- or downregulated. Comparison of microarray data and qRT-PCR data. We performed a literature search on the 40 top ranking, differentially expressed genes. Genes that might have an impact on proliferation or apoptosis were selected for qRT-PCR validation. Among these candidates a substantial (> 3-fold) difference in expression levels was found for DOG1 and IGFBP5 (Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5), while levels of other candidates were only marginally changed (Figure 6A). IGFBP5 levels decreased in GIST882 upon DOG1 knockdown (Figure 6B). In DOG1 negative GIST882B IGFBP5 transcript counts were unchanged compared to the parental DOG1-positive GIST882 cell line. Notably, DOG1-negative GIST430B cell line showed IGFBP5 transcriptome sequencing counts that were 5,000-fold higher than in the parental DOG1-positive GIST430 cell line (Figure 6C). The Ingenuity pathway analysis suggested the IGF-pathway together with paxillin-signaling as the top-ranking pathways affected by the DOG1 knockdown. Discussion. With the introduction of imatinib, a potent KIT-inhibitor, the treatment of GIST as a mainly KIT/PDGFRA-driven sarcoma has been revolutionized. Most patients whose tumors harbor activating KIT-mutations benefit from IM-treatment with a median progression-free survival of 12 to 24 months (27). While a subset of patients remains free of progression the majority eventually progress, at which point their therapeutic options are limited. Novel treatment strategies to prevent or overcome resistance are therefore urgently needed. DOG1 (Ano1 / TMEM16A), a calcium-dependent chloride channel, was identified in microarray studies among a number of genes whose expression was significantly higher in GIST than in other soft tissue sarcomas [13, 26]. It has since then proven to be a reliable immunohistochemical marker in pathological practice (17). Mutations of DOG1 have not been found in GIST (29) but expression levels are also high in ICC (interstitial cells of Cajal), the cells thought to share a common progenitor with GIST [14, 15]. Whether DOG1 is a lineage-specific marker that plays a role in differentiation or also might play a transforming role in GIST is yet unclear. To our knowledge we are the first to investigate DOG1 biologic roles and to assess DOG1 relevance as therapeutic target in GIST. Pathological and genetic analyses from resected metastases progressing on imatinib have revealed secondary KIT-mutations as a common mechanism of resistance. In a subset of patients, GIST metastases have lost KIT expression, indicating that KIT oncogenic programs have been supplanted by yet unidentified alternative oncogenic drivers (30). We observed a similar phenomenon in sublines of several GIST cell lines, which lost KIT expression during cultivation ex vivo. Interestingly, these cell lines also lost DOG1 expression suggesting interdependence of expression. Notably, the majority of KIT-negative GIST tumors (64%) in clinical practice also do not express DOG1 (17). In the studies reported herein, DOG1 knockdown resulted in strong functional inhibition of chloride currents but did not affect expression or activation of KIT and KIT-dependent signaling pathways (Figure 2A, data not shown). In our models, DOG1 therefore does not act as key regulator of KIT, and our studies suggest that DOG1 inhibition will not synergize with KIT kinase-inhibitor drugs in inactivating KIT. Whether DOG1 expression is directly coregulated with KIT is yet unknown, however, biochemical inhibition of KIT does not affect DOG1 expression (Figure 1C) in vitro. We further showed that neither DOG1 knockdown nor biochemical inhibitors of DOG1 alter the growth modulating effect of imatinib in vitro. However, we observed a substantial growth delay when GIST-T1 and GIST430 were grown as xenografts compared to scrambled controls in nude mice. This effect was not seen in GIST882. DOG1 is expressed in many organs (e.g. salivary glands) and DOG1 knock-out mice die soon after birth [10, 25, 26]. Little is known about DOG1 expression in human tissues but the UniGene database suggests an expression pattern similar to that in mice (33). Nonetheless, DOG1 expression is still remarkably high in both GIST and ICCs compared to non-GIST sarcomas (13) (16). Notably, Stanich et al. showed growth inhibitory effects after DOG1 knockdown and DOG1 biochemical inhibition in ICC short term cultures (34). They concluded that regulation of proliferation by DOG1 is related to its function as a Cl ? entry pathway by reducing the Cl ? concentration in the culture media. In contrast to Stanich and colleagues we did not observe a reduction of phosphorylated retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) (data not shown), as a possible explanation for a cell cycle arrest (35). DOG1 has also been linked to other types of cancers. Amplification of the chromosomal band 11q13, the genomic region containing DOG1, is frequently seen in breast, bladder, head and neck and esophageal cancer (36). Patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN) harbouring 11q13 amplifications were associated with a poor prognosis. These findings were recently confirmed by functional studies in SCCHN cell lines that showed that DOG1 amplification was associated with increased spreading, detachment and invasion of tumor cells (37). Similar to our findings Duvvuri et al. observed inhibition of tumor growth in SCCHN xenografts after knockdown of DOG1 (44). Notably, this effect was also seen in vitro. We did not find published evidence that provides simple answers as to why a DOG1 knockdown would affect cell growth in vivo but not in vitro, as seen in our models. We speculate that the more complex cell-cell interaction in 3-dimensional tumors compared to mono-layers as well as a tumor/host-interaction (e.g. vasculature) may be responsible for this effect. Using gene expression analyses we investigated differentially expressed genes that are directly associated with proliferation or survival. Pathway analyses using Ingenuity software suggested IGF- and paxillin signaling as the most relevant pathways affected by DOG1 knockdown. While the change of expression levels of genes involved in the paxillin-pathway were subtle, IGFBP5 was the strongest differentially expressed gene besides DOG1 as confirmed by qRT-PCR. In line with these findings the GIST cell line GIST430B, a KIT-negative and DOG1-negative subline of imatinib-resistant GIST430, showed a 5000-fold increase of IGFBP5 transcripts compared to its parental DOG1-positive GIST430 cell line. IGFBP5 was not upregulated in GIST882 following DOG1 knockdown and no growth delay was observed in vivo suggesting that IGFBP5 may not be relevant to all GIST. IGFBP5 is one of the six IGFBP family members and is dysregulated in diverse types of cancer including breast cancer (38), ovarian cancer (39) and retinoblastoma (40). IGFBP5 overexpression results in \u00a1\u00b0trapping\u00a1\u00b1 of IGF1 and IGF2 with subsequent inhibition of the IGF axis pathway (41). Of note, IGFBP5 has recently been shown to suppress tumor growth and metastasis of human osteosarcomas (42). In another model, IGFBP5 overexpression prevented tumor growth by inhibition of tumor vascularity which might explain the different biologic outcomes we found between our in vivo and in vitro experiments. Interestingly, IGF2 expression has recently been shown to predict a high mitotic index correlating with outcome in GIST underlining the relevance of the IGF-axis in GIST (43). DOG1 expression was also reported to promote tumor growth through activation of the MAPK pathway (44), which we did not observe in our models (data not shown). Of note, MAPK activation in imatinib-sensitive GIST models is usually strongly dependent on KIT activation (45). Given its high levels of expression, DOG1 could represent a tumor specific target in GIST. Tumor growth in our models was not dependent on DOG1 in vitro and only partially dependent in vivo. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role only in combination with other drugs. In addition, further efforts are needed to identify biochemical inhibitors with improved selectivity for DOG1 which recapitulate the effects seen upon DOG1 knockdown in vivo. At present, clinical evaluation of DOG1 inhibitors may be constrained by their concomitant inhibition of other chloride channels. Our results highlight the functional relevance of DOG1 in a subset of GIST and suggest that further studies are warranted to better understand DOG1 and IGF1-axis growth-regulation roles in GIST.

                "text": "Selective RAF inhibitor impairs ERK1/2 phosphorylation and growth in mutant NRAS, vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells\tThe RAF inhibitor vemurafenib achieves remarkable clinical responses in mutant BRAF melanoma patients. However, vemurafenib is burdened by acquired drug resistance and by the side effects associated with its paradoxical activation of the ERK1/2 pathway in wild-type BRAF cells. This paradoxical effect has driven the development of a new class of RAF inhibitors. Here, we tested one of these selective, non-paradox-inducing RAF inhibitors termed paradox-breaker-04 (PB04) or PLX7904. Consistent with its design, PB04 is able to efficiently inhibit activation of ERK1/2 in mutant BRAF melanoma cells but does not hyperactivate ERK1/2 in mutant RAS-expressing cells. Importantly, PB04 inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in mutant BRAF melanoma cells with acquired resistance to vemurafenib/PLX4720 that is mediated by a secondary mutation in NRAS. Consistent with ERK1/2 re-activation driving the re-acquisition of malignant properties, PB04 promoted apoptosis and inhibited entry into S phase and anchorage-independent growth in mutant N-RAS mediated vemurafenib-resistant cells. These data indicate that paradox-breaker RAF inhibitors may be clinically effective as a second line option in a cohort of acquired vemurafenib-resistant patients. INTRODUCTION. Advances in the treatment options for metastatic melanoma led to the FDA-approval in 2011 of two targeted therapies: ipilimumab and vemurafenib. The latter of these agents is a RAF inhibitor that selectively inhibits mutant BRAF signaling in V600 mutant BRAF-harboring cells. BRAF is a serine-threonine kinase that is mutated in 40?50% of melanomas; the most frequent alteration is a valine to glutamic acid substitution within the activation loop, V600E (Wellbrock et al., 2004). The V600E form of BRAF constitutively signals through the MAPK/ERK kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2) to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (Conner et al., 2003; Wan et al., 2004). V600E BRAF is a driver mutation in melanoma (Bollag et al., 2010; Tuveson et al., 2003) and targeting it with vemurafenib leads to tumor shrinkage in the majority of mutant BRAF melanomas and increases patient progression-free survival and overall survival (Bollag et al., 2010; Flaherty et al., 2010; Sosman et al., 2012). Despite this success, there are two main limitations of vemurafenib. Firstly, RAF inhibitors exhibit paradoxical effects on the ERK1/2 pathway; thus, in cells with high RAS activity vemurafenib activates MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling (Halaban et al., 2010; Heidorn et al., 2010; Kaplan et al., 2011; Poulikakos et al., 2010). Paradoxical activation of MEK-ERK1/2 is mediated by activation of CRAF, and likely underlies the high frequency (25%) of keratoacanthoma (KA), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) of the KA type, or well-differentiated cuSCC lesions that develop in vemurafenib-treated patients (Su et al., 2012). It has also been linked to the formation of adenomas and in at least one patient to leukemia (Callahan et al., 2012; Chapman et al., 2012). The second limitation is drug resistance. Approximately 10?15% of patients are intrinsically resistant and no tumor shrinkage is achieved with vemurafenib. Other patients (~50%) show tumor shrinkage greater than 30% but ultimately the disease progresses with a median of 6.3 months for progression-free survival. The mechanisms underlying this acquired resistance to vemurafenib have been actively studied and an overarching mode is reactivation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway (Aplin et al., 2011). Reactivation may be initiated through a secondary mutation in NRAS, expression of splice variant of V600E BRAF, enhanced expression of the alternative MAP3K, COT1/Tpl2, or downstream through secondary mutation in MEK1/2 (Johannessen et al., 2010; Nazarian et al., 2010; Poulikakos et al., 2011). Of these mechanisms, secondary mutations in NRAS are frequent and have been reported independently by multiple groups. Lo et al., described one melanoma patient with disease progression while on vemurafenib treatment at multiple sites, two of which harbored activating mutations in NRAS (Nazarian et al., 2010). Additionally, Poulikakos and colleagues identified NRAS mutations in 4 of 19 samples following progression on vemurafenib (Poulikakos et al., 2011). A new class of RAF inhibitors is being developed to potently inhibit mutant BRAF unencumbered by the effects of paradoxical activation. These paradox breaker (PB) inhibitors are expected to elicit a narrower spectrum of side effects; thus, permitting higher dosing. Here, we investigated the PB inhibitor PB04/PLX7904 in melanoma cells harboring either BRAF or NRAS mutations. Given the similarities in the mechanisms of RAF inhibitor paradoxical effects and mutant NRAS-mediated by-pass of RAF inhibitor blockade of the ERK1/2 pathway during acquired resistance, we also tested PB04 in vemurafenib-resistant cells harboring both BRAF and NRAS mutations. RESULTS. PB04 potently blocks ERK1/2 activation in mutant BRAF melanoma cells but does not induce hyperactivation of ERK1/2 in mutant NRAS cells. The selective RAF inhibitor PB04 (also known as PLX7904) is designed to avoid the paradoxical effects of RAF inhibitors. Initially, we compared the dose response of PB04 with that of PLX4720 (the tool compound for vemurafenib) in mutant BRAF WM793 melanoma cells. Similar to PLX4720, PB04 potently blocked phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 at high nmol to low \u00a5\u00ecmol doses (Fig. 1A). We expanded our analysis of PB04 to an additional 5 mutant BRAF harboring melanoma cells. This panel includes mutant BRAF cells that are PTEN deficient (WM115 and WM9) or PTEN and Rb deficient (SK-MEL207). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was rapidly inhibited by PB04 in all cell lines (Fig. 1B) and the inhibition was durable as indicated by the 16 h treatment (Fig. 1C). RAF inhibitors hyperactivate the ERK1/2 pathway in wild-type BRAF cells harboring RAS mutations (Halaban et al., 2010; Heidorn et al., 2010; Kaplan et al., 2011; Poulikakos et al., 2010). We have previously reported paradoxical activation of MEK and ERK1/2 by PLX4032/PLX4720 in the mutant NRAS melanoma lines: SbCl2, WM1346, WM1366 and WM1361A (Kaplan et al., 2011). Similar effects were observed in SK-MEL 2 cells (Fig. 1D). Next, we analyzed the effects of PB04 in these melanoma cells harboring NRAS mutations. Consistent with paradox breaker design, PB04 did not enhance or only modestly enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 after either 1 h (Fig. 1E) or 16 h (Fig. 1F) of treatment in the panel of 5 mutant NRAS cells lines. Together, these data show that PB04 potently inhibits phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in mutant BRAF melanoma cells without eliciting paradoxical activation in wild-type BRAF, mutant NRAS melanoma cells. PB04 does not paradoxically activate MEK-ERK1/2 signaling in mutant HRAS-expressing immortalized keratinocytes or squamous carcinoma cells. Paradoxical activation of the ERK1/2 pathway by vemurafenib in keratinocyte cells has been linked to the formation of cuSCC/KA lesions (Arnault et al., 2011; Su et al., 2012). Since this effect was associated with mutations in HRAS in 46% of cases, we tested the effects of PB04 in keratinocyte lineage cell lines that harbor HRAS mutations. We utilized two cells lines: human immortalized keratinocytes HaCaTs that ectopically express HRAS G12V and mouse squamous cell carcinoma cells PAM 212 that endogenously express HRAS G12V (Yuspa et al., 1980). In both HaCaT-HRAS G12V and PAM 212 cells, PLX4720 treatment enhanced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2 (Fig. 2A & B). By contrast, PB04 treatment led to a slight reduction in the levels of phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK1/2. These data indicate that PB04 does not elicit paradoxical activation in keratinocyte cells harboring mutant HRAS. PB04 elicits similar short-term responses compared to vemurafenib. Vemurafenib/PLX4720 treatment induces short-term responses that may modulate the initial apoptotic and proliferative response to mutant BRAF inhibition. For example, the stemness transcription factor FOXD3 is up-regulated following inhibition of the BRAF-MEK signaling in mutant BRAF melanoma cells (Abel and Aplin, 2010) and provides adaptive resistance to vemurafenib/PLX4720 (Basile et al., 2012). Other examples of resistance mechanisms to vemurafenib include up-regulation of PDGFR-\u00a5\u00e2 or IGF-1R genomic amplification/enhanced expression of mutant BRAF, up-regulation of COT1 and activation of AKT signaling (Das Thakur et al., 2013; Johannessen et al., 2010; Nazarian et al., 2010; Paraiso et al., 2011; Shao and Aplin, 2010; Shi et al., 2012; Villanueva et al., 2010). We determined the effect of PB RAF inhibitors on the aforementioned mechanisms in three mutant BRAF melanoma lines: 1205Lu, WM115 and A375 cells. No up-regulation of FOXD3 was observed after 1 h treatment with PB04 (data not shown); however, FOXD3 was detected in all 3 lines after 16 h of PB04 treatment (Fig. 3). PDGFR-\u00a5\u00e2 expression was up-regulated in all three melanoma cell lines following PB04 treatment (Fig. 3), similar to findings with PLX4720 in these cell lines (data not shown). However, no changes in the levels of BRAF and phospho-AKT were detected and IGF-1R expression decreased with PB04 treatment (Fig. 3). COT1 expression was not detected in these cells lines (data not shown). Overall, these data show that PB04 acts similarly to other RAF inhibitors in terms of leading to up-regulation of FOXD3 and PDGFR-\u00a5\u00e2. PB04 inhibits ERK1/2 activation on mutant BRAF/NRAS co-expressing melanoma cells. Next, we analyzed PB04 in the context of acquired resistance to vemurafenib that was recently FDA approved for the treatment of mutant BRAF melanoma patients. Re-activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway is a major mode of acquired resistance to vemurafenib and is frequently mediated by acquired mutations in NRAS and/or selection of a small population of cells co-expressing mutant BRAF and mutant NRAS (Nazarian et al., 2010; Poulikakos et al., 2011). In other studies, we generated a subset of BRAF V600E WM793 melanoma cells with acquired resistance to PLX4720 (the tool compound for vemurafenib) that co-expressed NRAS Q61K and BRAF V600E (Kaplan et al., 2012). In these cells (hereafter termed WM793-Res NRAS Q61K), ERK1/2 reactivation is dependent on NRAS and is regulated by both BRAF and CRAF in manner similar to the mechanism of paradoxical activation of the pathway by vemurafenib in cells with high RAS activity (Kaplan et al., 2012). We tested the effect of PB04 in two sub-lines of WM793-Res NRAS Q61K (#5 and #12). Both sub-lines exhibited a high degree of resistance to PLX4720-mediated inhibition of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig. 4A). By contrast, 1 h treatment with PB04 effectively blocked activation of ERK1/2 at doses equal to/above 1 \u00a5\u00ecM. Similar effects of PB04 were observed after 6 and 24 h of drug treatment in both sub-lines (Fig. 4B). To further test the effects of PB04 in PLX4720-resistant cells, we utilized WM793 cells that were engineered to ectopically express NRAS Q61K. In contrast to parental WM793 cells, PLX4720 does not inhibit phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in WM793 cells expressing exogenous NRAS Q61K cells (Fig. 4C). PB04, however, more effectively inhibited activation of ERK1/2 in NRAS Q61K-expressing WM793 cells compared to PLX4720 (Fig. 4D). We note that the level of resistance to PLX4720 appeared to decrease with continued passaging of these cells probably due to reduced expression of ectopic mutant NRAS. Nevertheless, these overall data show that PB04 inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation in mutant NRAS-mediated PLX4720-resistant cells. Enhanced apoptosis and inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in PB04 treated vemurafenib-resistant cells. To examine the effect of PB04-mediated ERK1/2 pathway inhibition in PLX4720-resistant cell lines, we analyzed apoptosis by annexin V staining. We have previously shown that WM793-Res NRAS Q61K cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by PLX4720 (Kaplan et al., 2012). PB04 effectively enhanced annexin V staining in parental WM793 cells as well as in the resistant sub-lines in 2D conditions (Fig. 5A). Cutaneous metastases reside in type I collagen-rich dermal microenvironment. To assay the effects of PB04 in dermal mimetic conditions, we performed apoptosis assays in 3D collagen. Parental WM793 cells are more susceptible to BRAF inhibition in 3D collagen compared to 2D cell culture conditions (Boisvert-Adamo and Aplin, 2006). Surprisingly, WM793-Res NRAS Q61K cells showed high levels of annexin V staining in the absence of any inhibitors (Fig. 5B). This effect may be related to loss of fitness in the absence of RAF inhibitor (Fig. 5B). Notably, PB04 treatment further enhanced levels of apoptosis in both WM793-Res NRAS Q61K cell lines compared to DMSO controls (Fig. 5B). Anchorage-independent growth in soft agar is often used as an in vitro measure of tumorigenicity. A375 cells readily form colonies in soft agar and we have shown that that A375-NRAS Q61K cells are resistant to PLX4720, whereas A375-NRAS WT cells are sensitive in colony formation assays (Kaplan et al., 2012). Notably, both A375-NRAS Q61K and A375-NRAS WT cells were sensitive to PB04 treatment, as measured by decreased colony number (Fig. 5C). PB04 treatment increased levels of annexin V staining in both A375-NRAS WT and A375-NRAS Q61K cells (Fig. 5D). Since the level of apoptosis induced by PB04 was noticeably lower in A375 cells compared to WM793 cells, we analyzed effects on entry into S phase. PB04 significantly inhibited the incorporation of the thymidine analog EdU in both A375 NRAS WT and A375 NRAS Q61K, although expression of NRAS Q61K provided a partial degree of resistance to PB04 in these assays (Fig. 5E). Together, these data show that PB04 is effective at inhibiting the growth of vemurafenib/PLX4720-resistant cells. DISCUSSION. RAF inhibitors are the new first-line therapy for V600 BRAF melanoma and form the building blocks for further improvements to achieve more durable responses with reduced side effects. One approach is to develop a new generation of RAF inhibitors that do not elicit the paradoxical activation of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling in wild-type BRAF cells (Halaban et al., 2010; Heidorn et al., 2010; Kaplan et al., 2011; Poulikakos et al., 2010). Theoretically, this would enable enhanced tolerability and, in turn, increased drug dosage. This approach has led to the generation of a series of drugs known as paradox breakers. In this study, we analyzed the ability of one of these inhibitors, PB04. Initially, we show that PB04 is an efficient inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation in a panel of mutant BRAF melanoma cells but does not hyperactivate ERK1/2 in the mutant NRAS melanoma cells. These data are consistent with the paradox breaker design of this RAF inhibitor. The development of PB inhibitors represents a major advance in the field given that most of clinical grade RAF inhibitors to date elicit ERK1/2 hyperactivation in vitro and the formation of cuSCC/KA in vivo. Indeed, a second clinical grade RAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, effectively inhibits mutant BRAF signaling, elicits strong clinical responses in patients but also induces the formation of cuSCC/KA (Falchook et al., 2012). In mutant NRAS cells, which utilize CRAF to activate ERK1/2 (Dumaz et al., 2006), PB04 did not effectively inhibit pathway activation. This is likely due to the 21-fold higher IC 50 of PB04 towards CRAF compared to BRAF V600E, as measured by in vitro kinase assays. Similar to vemurafenib/PLX4720, PB04 led to an up-regulation of FOXD3. Since FOXD3 may be associated with an adaptive response to RAF inhibitors (Abel and Aplin, 2010; Basile et al., 2012), a similar primary/intrinsic resistance profile may be associated with paradox breakers as with vemurafenib. In the phase 2 and 3 trials with vemurafenib, approximately 50% of V600 BRAF melanoma patients responded with at least 30% tumor shrinkage (Chapman et al., 2011; Sosman et al., 2012). As with targeted therapies in other tumor types, the benefit provided by vemurafenib was limited in time and many of initial responders ultimately developed progressive disease. This acquired resistance to vemurafenib is frequently associated with re-activation of the ERK1/2 pathway that is mediated by secondary mutations in NRAS or MEK1 and the expression of BRAF slice variants (Nazarian et al., 2010; Poulikakos et al., 2011; Wagle et al., 2011). We studied whether PB04 could inhibit activation of ERK1/2 in the setting of mutant NRAS-mediated resistance to vemurafenib. Vemurafenib and PLX4720 are not able to efficiently inhibit phospho-ERK1/2 in BRAF V600E melanoma cells with an acquired endogenous NRAS Q61K allele or co-expressing ectopic NRAS Q61K (data within and (Kaplan et al., 2012)). However in these systems, PB04 was able to efficiently inhibit phosphorylation of ERK1/2, induce apoptosis and inhibit anchorage-independent growth. Activation of ERK1/2 in the NRAS Q61K/BRAF V600E melanoma cells is dependent upon both BRAF and CRAF (Kaplan et al., 2012); thus, the inhibitory effect of PB04 in this system is likely due to inhibition of BRAF V600E activity and the lack of transactivation of CRAF. While secondary mutations in NRAS are frequent in acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors in melanoma, multiple other mechanisms of resistance exist. Further studies will determine the effect of PB inhibitors on other resistance mechanisms especially those that involve altered dimerization properties of RAFs. The main potential use of selective, paradox breaker RAF inhibitors in BRAF V600 melanoma patients is as a first line therapy. Theoretically, increased dosing of PB drugs should lead to effective inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway with a decreased incidence of associated cuSCC/KA. In this setting, it is likely that the frequency of secondary mutations in NRAS leading to acquired resistance will be reduced. Our studies indicate a second potential use is in vemurafenib-treated patients who show disease progression that is associated with a secondary mutation in NRAS. Such patients may benefit from a switch in their RAF inhibitor treatment from vemurafenib to a paradox breaker. While ongoing trials are testing the combinatorial approaches such as RAF inhibitors (dabrafenib, GSK2118436) plus MEK inhibitors (trametinib, GSK1120212) [Clinical Trials.gov ID: NCT01072175 and NCT01619774 and (Flaherty et al., 2012)], it is likely that the numbers of drugs being combined will increase. For example, there is already considerable interest in combining RAF or MEK inhibitors with drugs targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Since combining drugs often produces new, unanticipated toxicities and side effects, the use of a single drug to effectively inhibit the ERK1/2 pathway without eliciting paradoxical effects may be more tolerable in these combinatorial regimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Inhibitors. PB04 and PLX4720 were kindly provided by Dr. Gideon Bollag (Plexxikon Inc., Berkeley, CA). AZD6244 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals LLC (Houston, TX). Cell lines. Melanoma cells were cultured, as previously described (Hu and Aplin, 2010). WM793, WM115, WM9, WM278, WM1346, WM1366, WM1361A, Sbcl2 and 1205Lu were cultured in MCDB 153 containing 20% Leibovitz L-15 medium, 2% FBS, 5 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml insulin and penicillin/streptomycin. SK-MEL 24, SKMEL-2, and SK-MEL 207 cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS. A375 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. The BRAF and NRAS genotypes were verified by Sanger sequencing. A375-NRAS WT, and the PLX4720-resistant cell lines, A375-NRAS Q61K and 1205TR-NRAS Q61K have been previously described (Kaplan et al., 2012). HaCaT and PAM212 cells were grown in DMEM with 10%FBS and in in RPMI 1640 and 10%FBS, respectively. Generation of resistant cell lines. WM793 cells were cultured in the aforementioned MCDB 153 medium in the presence of 5 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 for four weeks. Medium containing PLX4720 was replenished every two d. Resistant sublines were generated by seeding cells at low density and allowing isolated colonies to form. These colonies were picked and cells expanded in the continued presence of PLX4720 (Kaplan et al., 2012). Western blotting. Western blotting was performed, as previously described (Hu and Aplin, 2010), and quantitated using a Versadoc Imaging system (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Primary antibodies utilized were: phospho-MEK (S217/S221), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204, #4377), and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 (#3169) from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverley, MA., MEK (sc-219), ERK1/2 (sc-094), BRAF (sc-5284), IGF-1R\u00a5\u00e2 (sc-713), HRAS (sc-520) and NRAS (sc-519) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, FOXD3 (Poly6317) from BioLegend, San Diego, CA, and \u00a5\u00e2-actin (A5316) from Sigma Aldrich, Inc., St Louis MO. Three-dimensional (3-D) collagen gels. Collagen gels were cast by mixing the following on ice: MEM (Lonza, Inc. Walkersville, MD), 2 mM L-glutamine, 2 % FBS, 0.15 % sodium bicarbonate and 0.8 mg/ml bovine type-I collagen (Organogenesis Inc., Canton, MA). Cells were seeded in 2 ml collagen gels and incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 min. After polymerization, the collagen gel lattice was overlaid with 1.5 ml medium and inhibitor at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 48 hrs. 3-D collagen gels were dissolved in 1 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) solution to release cells. Apoptosis assays. Apoptosis assay was done as previously described (Shao and Aplin, 2010). Cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in 100 \u00a5\u00ecl binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, 0.14 M sodium chloride, 2.5 mM calcium chloride), stained with 5 \u00a5\u00ecl Annexin V-APC (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) for 15 min and finally an additional 400 \u00a5\u00ecl binding buffer was added. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry on the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using Flowjo software (Three Star, Inc. Ashland, OR). EdU (5-ethynyl-2\u00a1\u00c7-deoxyuridine) incorporation assays. A375 NRAS WT and A375 NRAS Q61K cells were treated with PB04 for 48 h before the addition of 10 \u00a5\u00ecM EdU for another 16 hrs. Cells were then processed using the Click-iT \u00a2\u00e2 EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Flow Cytometry Assay kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for flow cytometry analysis. Soft agar assays. Cells (3 \u00a1\u00bf 10 3 cells/mL) were grown in 0.2% soft agar, as previously described (Abel and Aplin, 2010). Cells were grown for 7 d, replacing the medium every 3 d. Three random fields per chamber were acquired using Nikon \u00a2\u00e2 Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with NIS-Elements AR 3.00 software (Nikon). Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using an unpaired student t-test assuming unequal variance. SIGNIFICANCE. We provide studies on a new class of RAF inhibitors to inhibit the ERK1/2 pathway in mutant BRAF melanoma cells. RAF inhibitors that do not elicit the paradoxical activation of the ERK1/2 pathway in wild-type BRAF cells have clear utility as a first-line therapy that permits increased dosing with a decreased incidence of associated cutaneous squamous cell lesions. Furthermore, our studies indicate that they may be useful as a second-line option in vemurafenib-treated patients who show disease progression that is associated with a secondary mutation in NRAS.

                "text": "Dabrafenib; Preclinical Characterization, Increased Efficacy when Combined with Trametinib, while BRAF/MEK Tool Combination Reduced Skin Lesions\tMitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway activation has been implicated in many types of human cancer. BRAF mutations that constitutively activate MAPK signalling and bypass the need for upstream stimuli occur with high prevalence in melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, ovarian cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. In this report we characterize the novel, potent, and selective BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib (GSK2118436). Cellular inhibition of BRAF V600E kinase activity by dabrafenib resulted in decreased MEK and ERK phosphorylation and inhibition of cell proliferation through an initial G 1 cell cycle arrest, followed by cell death. In a BRAF V600E-containing xenograft model of human melanoma, orally administered dabrafenib inhibited ERK activation, downregulated Ki67, and upregulated p27, leading to tumor growth inhibition. However, as reported for other BRAF inhibitors, dabrafenib also induced MAPK pathway activation in wild-type BRAF cells through CRAF (RAF1) signalling, potentially explaining the squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas arising in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. In addressing this issue, we showed that concomitant administration of BRAF and MEK inhibitors abrogated paradoxical BRAF inhibitor-induced MAPK signalling in cells, reduced the occurrence of skin lesions in rats, and enhanced the inhibition of human tumor xenograft growth in mouse models. Taken together, our findings offer preclinical proof of concept for dabrafenib as a specific and highly efficacious BRAF inhibitor and provide evidence for its potential clinical benefits when used in combination with a MEK inhibitor. Introduction. The MAPK signal transduction pathway plays a central role in cellular growth, differentiation, and stress response [1]?[5]. This pathway is normally activated by the binding of extracellular growth factors to membrane-bound receptors, which then recruit intracellular proteins to the cell membrane, leading to the activation of the small guanosine triphosphate-binding protein, RAS. Consequently, RAS adopts an activated conformation that stimulates downstream signalling, resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of ERK, which regulates a wide range of cellular processes. However, this pathway can be constitutively activated by mutation of specific proteins, including BRAF. Such activating mutations appear to mimic regulatory phosphorylation of BRAF and increase its kinase activity compared with the wild-type protein [6]. Over 45 cancer-associated BRAF mutations have been identified [7] with a high frequency in specific cancers, including 40?60% of melanoma [6], 30?50% of papillary thyroid, 5?20% of colorectal, and \u00a1\u00ad30% of ovarian cancer [7]. Approximately 90% of all BRAF mutations identified in human cancers are a T1799A transversion in exon 15, which results in a V600E amino acid substitution and BRAF kinase activation [7], [8]. The high frequency of activating mutations in tumors and ensuing MAPK pathway addiction make BRAF an attractive therapeutic target, where inhibition of the kinase activity of BRAF V600E and other activated BRAF mutants could provide an effective therapy. BRAF inhibitors with diverse levels of selectivity have been identified and clinically tested [9]?[13]. Despite demonstrating therapeutic activity, a clinical increase in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) incidence has been associated with treatment using sorafenib [14]?[17], PLX4032 [18], and GSK2118436 (dabrafenib) [11]. Increased ERK phosphorylation in wild-type cells exposed to these inhibitors, caused by feedback upregulation of the MAPK pathway, was proposed to be responsible for increased cell proliferation that may lead to SCC growth [19]?[22]. We have identified a BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib [23], and here characterize its preclinical activity with high potency, selectivity, and inhibition of human tumor xenograft growth. We also demonstrate that increased phospho-ERK in wild-type BRAF cells, as a result of exposure to dabrafenib, is CRAF-dependent and can be abrogated by MEK inhibition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that co-administration of BRAF and MEK inhibitors improves both the safety, by reducing the occurrence of skin lesions, and the in vivo activity profile, by reducing tumor regrowth, over that of a BRAF inhibitor alone in rodents. Materials and Methods. Proteins. Various BRAF orthologs (human, cynomolgus monkey, dog, rat) were cloned in-house. Human BRAF V600E was cloned from the A375P cell line. All BRAF orthologs were sub-cloned into the Gateway\u00a2\u00e7 vector system, and wild-type human BRAF (residues 1?766) subsequently underwent site-directed mutagenesis to generate the V600D and V600K mutants. Full-length BRAF genes were tagged with 6\u00a1\u00bfHis-SBP and transiently transfected in a HEK293F expression system (Invitrogen K9000-01 protocol). Transfected cells were incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, 5% CO 2 on a shaker at 80 r.p.m. for 48 h and harvested by centrifugation. BRAF proteins were purified by UltraLink\u00a2\u00e7-immobilized Streptavidin affinity and Superdex\u00a2\u00e2 200 size exclusion chromatography. Baculovirus-expressed GST-tagged CRAF truncate (residues 306?648), containing Y340D/Y341D mutations for constitutive kinase activity, was obtained from Upstate/Millipore. N-terminal GST-tagged MEK1 was expressed in BL21[DE3]/pRR692 cells and purified by Glutathione Sepharose\u00a2\u00e2 4FF and Q-Sepharose\u00a2\u00e2 chromatography. The GST tag was cleaved with TEV protease and MEK1 was purified on a Superdex\u00a2\u00e2 200 column. Enzymology. The activity of dabrafenib against RAF kinases was evaluated using BRAF/CRAF-activated MEK ATPase coupled assays [24]. Inhibitor mode of action was demonstrated in a fluorescence polarization competition binding assay using an in-house TAMRA-labelled, ATP-competitive small molecule ligand, the K d of which was determined as 0.9 nM and 3.6 nM for human wild-type and BRAF V600E, respectively. Incubations were carried out over a range of dabrafenib concentrations for 120 min at room temperature in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.3, 1 mM CHAPS, 10 mM MgCl 2, and 1 mM DTT, containing 1 nM ligand and 2 nM wild-type or 4 nM V600E BRAF, after which fluorescence anisotropy was measured using a PerkinElmer EnVision\u00a2\u00e7 reader. Cell Lines. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) except YUMAC cells, which were purchased from the Yale Dermatology Cell Culture Facility. All cells were grown at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, 5% CO 2 in the recommended media, supplemented with 10% FBS (SAFC Biosciences) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). BRAF and RAS mutation status were verified for all cell lines by in-house sequencing. Antibodies. Antibodies towards the indicated proteins were purchased from the following sources: ERK1/2, pERK (pY204), MEK1/2, pMEK (pS218, pS222) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ppERK (pT202, pY204) (Cell Signaling Technology & mouse clone MAPK-YT from Sigma-Aldrich), Ki67 (mouse clone MIB-1), p27 Kip1 (mouse clone Kip-1) (DakoCytomation), goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, donkey anti-rabbit, donkey anti-goat secondaries (LI-COR Biosciences), donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen), and sheep anti-rabbit (Rockland). Mouse control IgG for immunohistochemistry was from DakoCytomation. Western Blot Analysis. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 150 000 to 300 000 per well, grown overnight at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, 5% CO 2, and treated with 0.2% DMSO or dabrafenib in 0.2% DMSO for the indicated time, or 1 h if not specified. Cells were lysed in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM sodium-\u00a5\u00e2-glycerophosphate, 2 mM Na 3VO 4, 12.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2\u00a1\u00bf Complete EDTA-free mini protease inhibitor tablets (Roche), 2\u00a1\u00bf phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad DC\u00a2\u00e2 or dye-based protein assays and lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen NuPAGE\u00a2\u00e7) and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with Odyssey\u00a2\u00e7 (LI-COR Biosciences) blocking buffer and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. Blots were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, incubated with secondary antibodies, and washed again prior to signal detection on a LI-COR Odyssey\u00a2\u00e7 reader. In-cell Western Analysis. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 20 000 to 30 000 per well, grown overnight at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, 5% CO 2, and treated with 0.2% D DDMSO or dabrafenib in 0.2% DMSO for 1 h, fixed with 3.7% formalin in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with Odyssey\u00a2\u00e7 (LI-COR Biosciences) blocking buffer, and probed for ERK and pERK. They were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, incubated with secondary antibodies, washed again, and fluorescence was detected on a LI-COR Aerius\u00a2\u00e2 reader. siRNA Studies. siRNA complexes were prepared per the manufacturer's instructions using Dharmacon RNAi duplex (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Lipofectamine\u00a2\u00e2 RNAiMAX\u00a2\u00e2 (Invitrogen), and Opti-MEM\u00a2\u00e7 (Gibco) and allowed to form at room temperature for at least 40 min. Volumes of 1 mL of RNAi complex were added to each well of a plate with 150 000 cells in complete medium (no antibiotic) and incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, 5% CO 2 for the indicated times. Data shown are representative of two different studies using pooled siRNA and a third study using a shRNA against a different sequence for each targeted transcript. Cell Growth Assay. Cells were seeded at 500 to 2 000 per well in black 384-well plates (Greiner), incubated overnight at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, 5% CO 2, and treated with 0.2% D DDMSO or dabrafenib in 0.2% DMSO for 72 h. Growth was measured with CellTiter-Glo\u00a2\u00e7 (Promega) reagent per the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol, using a PerkinElmer EnVision\u00a2\u00e2 reader at t=0 and 72 h. IC 50 values for cell growth inhibition (gIC 50) were determined. Cell Cycle Analysis. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 3 000 per well, incubated overnight at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, 5% CO 2, and treated with 0.2% D MSO or dabrafenib in 0.2% DMSO for 24, 48, or 72 h. Cells were permeabilized, DNA was stained with propidium iodide [25], and samples were read on a BD LSRII flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using the cell cycle platform of FlowJo v6.1.1 software. Caspase Activation. Cells were seeded in white 96-well plates (NUNC) at 2 500 per well, incubated overnight at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, 5% CO 2, and treated with 0.2% D MSO or dabrafenib in 0.2% DMSO. At selected times, caspase-3/7 activity and cell density were determined using Caspase-Glo\u00a2\u00e7 (Promega) and CellTiter-Glo\u00a2\u00e7 reagents, respectively, using a PerkinElmer EnVision\u00a2\u00e2 reader. Caspase activity was normalized to cell density and percent induction over the DMSO control was determined. Tumor Xenograft Studies. Cells were implanted subcutaneously in female CD1 nu/nu mice and grown to form tumors. When tumors reached 150 mm 3 to 200 mm 3, animals were treated with dabrafenib, trametinib (GSK1120212), both agents, or vehicle alone by daily oral gavage of 0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2% Tween 80 in pH 8.0 distilled water at 0.2 mL per 20 g of body weight for the duration stipulated. Tumor volumes were estimated twice weekly from two-dimensional caliper measurements using the prolate ellipsoid equation , where v=volume (mm 3), l=length (mm), and w=width (mm), and reported as means for n of 7 or 8 mice per group. Tumor growth inhibition represents the percentage volume differential between treated and control tumors at the time when vehicle-treated tumors exceeded a volume of 1 000 mm 3. Partial regression is defined as a 50% decrease from an individual tumor's starting volume for at least 1 week (three consecutive measurements). Complete regression is defined as a >93% decrease in individual tumor volume for at least 1 week. All animal procedures were conducted in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited facility at GlaxoSmithKline in accordance with the GlaxoSmithKline Policy on the Care, Welfare, and Treatment of Laboratory Animals and were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at GlaxoSmithKline. All efforts were made to minimize suffering and mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation if at least one death occurred per treatment group, if an animal appeared moribund or in distress, or if the tumor became ulcerated. Pharmacokinetic Analysis. Compound concentrations were determined from flash-frozen hemolyzed blood samples (blood:water ratio of 11) or tumor homogenates (tumor:water ratio of 14) by HPLC/MS-MS analysis. Pharmacodynamic Measurement of Phospho-ERK. Tumors were harvested, homogenized (BD Bioscience Medimachine) in 1 mL each of ice-cold Western Blot Analysis buffer containing 4 mM sodium pyrophosphate, then centrifuged (18 000\u00a1\u00bfg, 15 min, 4\u00a1\u00c6C), and flash-frozen. Samples were analyzed by duplex ELISA (MesoScale Discovery) for total and phospho ERK1/2 per the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions using an MSD SI6000 reader. Immunohistochemistry. A375P tumors were harvested at 6 h after the sixth daily dose with compound or vehicle, cut into samples of \u00a1\u00ad100 mm 3 in volume, fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF, VWR) for 24 h, and transferred into 70% ethanol prior to paraffin embedding. Paraffin-embedded blocks were sectioned (4 \u00a5\u00ecm to 5 \u00a5\u00ecm) and immunostained for ppERK, Ki67, and p27 Kip1 by Mosaic Laboratories (Lake Forest, CA). Investigative Rat Study to Address BRAF Inhibitor-Induced Skin Lesion Formation by Co-administration of BRAF and MEK Tool Inhibitors. Following acclimation, 24 male Crl:(CD)SD rats (\u00a1\u00ad9 weeks of age, Charles River Laboratories) were randomized by body weight into four groups of n=6 per group. Animals were dosed for 12 consecutive days by oral gavage with vehicle or 150 mg/kg/d GSK2366297 (a tool BRAF inhibitor) in combination with 0, 0.75, or 1.5 mg/kg/d GSK2091976 (a tool MEK inhibitor) at dose volumes of 10 mL/kg/d (GSK2366297) or 5 mL/kg/d (GSK2091976). Blood samples were collected for toxicokinetic evaluation on day 12 (\u00a1\u00ad2 h and \u00a1\u00ad14 h post-last dose). All efforts were made to minimize suffering. At \u00a1\u00ad24 h post-final dose, rats were euthanized by isoflurane anesthesia/exsanguination and necropsied. Skin (left forepaw and hindpaw) was collected into 10% NBF, trimmed, decalcified in Immunocal\u00a2\u00e2 decalcifier until judged complete by palpation, and processed. Stomachs from all study animals and tissues with macroscopic observations were also collected into 10% NBF. All samples were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned (5 \u00a5\u00ecm), and stained with hematoxylin/eosin for microscopic examination. All animal procedures were conducted in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited facility at GlaxoSmithKline in accordance with the GlaxoSmithKline Policy on the Care, Welfare, and Treatment of Laboratory Animals and were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at GlaxoSmithKline. Results. Dabrafenib is a Potent and Selective BRAF Inhibitor. Dabrafenib (Figure 1A) was identified through a structure-activity-relationship effort described separately [23]. In the current study, dabrafenib displayed similar inhibition of human BRAF, CRAF, and several BRAF orthologs, with slightly higher activity against human BRAF V600E/K (Figure 1B). Binding to BRAF V600E and wild-type BRAF was shown to be ATP-competitive by virtue of its ability to displace a known ATP-competitive ligand (Figure S1). When tested against a panel of 270 kinases, dabrafenib demonstrated selectivity towards RAF kinases, with only 6 additional kinases having an IC 50<100 nM (Table S1). In cell lines encoding BRAF V600E, dabrafenib inhibited pERK and pMEK in a concentration-dependent manner with IC 50 values of 3 nM and 6 nM, respectively, while total ERK and MEK levels were unchanged (Figure S2). In order to dissect the cellular mechanism of dabrafenib, siRNA studies targeting ARAF, BRAF, or CRAF, alone or in the presence of dabrafenib, were performed in the BRAF V600E cell line, A375P (Figure 2). A dabrafenib concentration of 8 nM, selected to allow detection of subtle inhibitory effects from pathway protein level changes, inhibited pERK and pMEK by >90% (lane 2) while ARAF, BRAF, CRAF, ERK, and MEK levels remained unchanged. By way of comparison, ARAF (lane 3) and CRAF (lane 5) siRNA did not alter pERK or pMEK, while BRAF siRNA (lane 4) inhibited pERK and pMEK, as expected and as demonstrated elsewhere [26], [27], confirming that MEK and ERK activation is exclusively BRAF V600E-dependent in a BRAF V600E cell line. Moreover, and in answer to the question posed by the current study, inhibition of MEK and ERK activation by dabrafenib (lane 2) was comparable with that of BRAF siRNA, further demonstrating this compound's ability to inhibit BRAF V600E signalling in cells. Interestingly, ARAF (lane 6) or CRAF (lane 8) knockdown lowered sensitivity to dabrafenib, as judged by increased pERK and pMEK when compared with compound alone (lane 2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that in BRAF V600E cells, MAPK activation is solely driven by BRAF V600E and can be effectively inhibited by dabrafenib. Dabrafenib Inhibits Mutant BRAF Cell Line and Tumor Xenograft Growth. Dabrafenib was tested for its ability to inhibit the growth of 195 tumor cell lines in a 3-day proliferation assay (Figure 3 and Table S2). Sixteen (80%) of the 20 cell lines encoding BRAF V600E were sensitive to dabrafenib (gIC 50<200 nM). Furthermore, three of the other 5 mutant BRAF cell lines were sensitive to dabrafenib (gIC 50<30 nM), including WM-115 (BRAF V600D) and YUMAC (BRAF V600K). However, 133 (88%) of the 152 RAS/RAF wild-type and all 18 mutant RAS cell lines were insensitive to dabrafenib (gIC 50>10 \u00a5\u00ecM), demonstrating high selectivity for inhibition of the growth of activated mutant BRAF cell lines. The effect of dabrafenib on cell cycle and induction of apoptosis was analyzed in cell lines encoding BRAF V600E (A375P, SK-MEL-28) or wild-type BRAF (HFF). Dabrafenib arrested the BRAF V600E cells at the G 1 (2n DNA) phase of the cell cycle, with increased DNA fragmentation (<2n DNA) at higher concentrations, whereas wild-type BRAF cells were unaffected at dabrafenib concentrations up to 10 \u00a5\u00ecM (Figure S3A). While the level of apoptosis can vary between cell lines [28], dabrafenib consistently induced caspase-3/7 activation and apoptosis in these BRAF V600E cells (Figure S3B). The in vivo activity of dabrafenib was tested in a BRAF V600E (A375P) human tumor xenograft model in mice. Mice were dosed orally once daily at 30 mg/kg for 14 days and tumors were measured both during and following cessation of treatment. Tumors and blood were harvested for pERK inhibition and dabrafenib concentration measurement, respectively, at days 1, 7, and 14. Dabrafenib is orally bioavailable, doesn\u00a1\u00aft significantly accumulate after multiple dosing, and causes a reduction of pERK that is sustained for up to 18 h post-dosing after 7 and 14 days of dosing (Figure 4A). Tumors from 6 h post-final dose were stained by immunohistochemistry (Figure 4B) for markers of cell proliferation (Ki67), growth inhibition (p27), and MAPK signalling (pERK). Results support an on-target mechanism for cell growth inhibition by dabrafenib, which elicited a downregulation of pERK and Ki67 by 89% and 28%, respectively, as well as upregulation of p27 by 54%. These changes in tumor growth marker levels translated into efficacy, where dabrafenib showed dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in a BRAF V600E (Colo 205) human tumor xenograft model (Figure 5) after a 14-day treatment, with 4 of 8 mice showing partial regressions at 100 mg/kg. Inhibition of tumor growth was significant when compared with the vehicle-treated control at the end of the 14-day dosing period, with p-values of 0.007, 0.00009, and 0.000005 for dabrafenib doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, respectively. Use of the Colo 205 model demonstrated activity in yet another BRAF V600E cell/tumor type (colorectal cancer), while similar results were also seen in an A375P tumor xenograft model [23] with 4 complete and 2 partial regressions at 100 mg/kg, along with 1 complete and 2 partial regressions at 10 mg/kg from groups of 8 mice. In both cases, drug treatment cessation after 14 days resulted in tumor outgrowth, suggesting a need for chronic therapy for maximum clinical benefit. Dabrafenib Induces MAPK Activation in Wild-type RAF Cells. While dabrafenib can inhibit proliferation via a G 1 cell cycle arrest, induce apoptosis, and cause tumor regression in BRAF V600E cells, wild-type BRAF tumor cell lines were not responsive to dabrafenib, despite MEK inhibitor sensitivity [29]. Indeed, HCT-116 cells, which encode mutant KRAS and wild-type RAF proteins, are insensitive to dabrafenib (Figure 3 and Table S2) but sensitive to a MEK1/2 inhibitor (GSK1120212, trametinib) with a gIC 50 of 21 nM [29]. Additionally, HCT-116 cells showed increased pMEK and pERK following dabrafenib treatment at 100 nM or 300 nM (Figure 6A, lanes 11 and 10, respectively) when compared with the DMSO control (lane 12). In order to demonstrate through which RAF protein dabrafenib elicits this elevated MAPK signalling, we depleted individual RAF proteins using siRNA (Figure 6A). Following dabrafenib treatment, MAPK upregulation was not sensitive to ARAF or BRAF knockdown (lanes 1/2 and 4/5, respectively), but was reduced to baseline upon CRAF depletion (lanes 7/8). Consequently, these data suggest that paradoxical MAPK pathway activation by dabrafenib in wild-type RAF and mutant RAS cell lines is CRAF-dependent and that dabrafenib is only active against activated BRAF in cells. BRAF/MEK Tool Inhibitor Combination Decreases the Occurrence of Skin Lesions and Dabrafenib/Trametinib Combination Enhances Tumor Growth Inhibition in Rodent Models. It has been proposed that hyperproliferative skin lesions (keratoacanthomas) and in some cases SCC in BRAF inhibitor-treated patients were caused by pERK upregulation in wild-type BRAF cells [20]?[22], with a high RAS mutation frequency [30]. This upregulation is CRAF-dependent, so we hypothesized that combined BRAF/CRAF inhibition might reduce the incidence of hyperproliferative skin lesions. Since no selective, efficacious CRAF inhibitor is available, we tested this hypothesis by combining BRAF (dabrafenib) and MEK (trametinib) inhibitors. First, we demonstrated that dabrafenib-induced pERK upregulation in HCT-116 cells could be abrogated by simultaneous treatment with both inhibitors (Figure 6B). Indeed, pERK upregulation following treatment with 100 or 300 nM dabrafenib alone (lanes 2/3) was abolished by co-treatment with 50 nM or 5 nM trametinib (lanes 7/10 and 8/11, respectively). This concurs with data in Figure 6A, showing that dabrafenib-induced pERK upregulation in HCT-116 cells is MAPK pathway-dependent. To test if concomitant treatment with our BRAF and MEK inhibitors would ameliorate BRAF inhibitor-induced skin hyperplasia, as demonstrated previously with PLX4720 and PD184352 [30], we performed a rat 12-day repeat dose investigative study with BRAF (GSK2366297) and MEK (GSK2091976 [31]) tool inhibitors. GSK2366297 is of similar structure and activity profile to dabrafenib and was selected due to a faster onset of skin lesions, likely related to its higher potency (Table S3). Macroscopic and light microscopic photographs (Figure 7A, panels a-c and d-f, respectively) of ventral forepaw skin were taken following treatment. Rats treated with GSK2366297 alone showed a generalized skin crusting with epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis (Figure 7A, b). Microscopically, these areas correlated with minimal to moderately increased epidermal thickening (hyperplasia), primarily affecting the stratum spinosum and to a lesser extent the stratum granulosum, with epithelial invagination into the dermis (rete ridge formation), and increased thickening of the overlaying keratinized stratum corneum (Figure 7A, e). The accompanying hyperkeratosis, primarily orthokeratotic, was characterized by increased stratum corneum thickening. Epithelial hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis was not observed in the control rats (Figure 7A, a/d), those given GSK2091976 alone (data not shown), or the combination of GSK2366297 with GSK2091976 (Figure 7A, c/f). Similar results were also seen in scrotal skin and forestomach, and pharmacokinetic data confirmed similar systemic exposure to GSK2366297 when delivered alone or in combination with GSK2091976 (data not shown). Phospho-ERK immunoreactivity within the epidermis was inconclusive due to staining variability, but Ki67 within the basal epithelial layer (paws and forestomach) was increased in rats given GSK2366297 alone, consistent with the observed epithelial hyperplasia (data not shown). Development of these hyperproliferative lesions is likely pharmacologically mediated by paradoxical RAF inhibitor-dependent MAPK upregulation in wild-type RAF cells, which can enhance growth via ARAF or CRAF [20], [32]. This mechanism may support the development of SCC in humans treated with RAF inhibitors [33]. From data in Figure 6 we hypothesized that BRAF/MEK inhibitor co-administration would prevent MAPK upregulation and skin lesion development in rats. Indeed, in vivo data in Figure 7A confirmed that BRAF inhibitor-induced skin lesions in rats could be prevented by concomitant treatment with a MEK inhibitor. Together with our in vitro cellular data, these results are consistent with pharmacologically-mediated mechanisms suggestive of paradoxical MAPK pathway activation by dabrafenib in wild-type BRAF cells. Finally, we investigated whether BRAF and MEK inhibitor co-administration would also be advantageous in reducing BRAF V600E tumor growth. Figure 7B demonstrates that combined oral treatment for 90 consecutive days with dabrafenib and trametinib shows superior inhibition of tumor growth over either drug alone, including a 10-fold higher, single agent dose (300 mg/kg) providing the maximum bioavailable blood level of dabrafenib. At termination (day 43) of the vehicle-treated group, the beneficial effect of the combination on inhibition of tumor growth was significantly superior to 30 mg/kg dabrafenib alone (p=0.01) and 0.3 mg/kg trametinib alone (p=0.0001). Circulating blood levels for single and combined agents at day 1 and 58 showed similar concentrations, suggesting steady state. Discussion. BRAF-activating mutations have been identified in many cancers [6] as a causative determinant of hyperproliferation [8], [19]. RNA knockout [34] and compound inhibition of BRAF [35]?[37] causes cell cycle arrest and death of mutant BRAF tumor cells, mitigating the clinical use of BRAF inhibitors for treatment of activated BRAF-driven cancers. We have characterized dabrafenib as a selective RAF kinase inhibitor with activity against full-length BRAF from multiple species. While dabrafenib inhibits a truncated CRAF kinase in vitro, this does not translate into cell culture, as cell lines with CRAF-dependent MEK activation (MEK inhibitor-sensitive) are insensitive to dabrafenib. The reason for this discrepancy between enzymatic and cellular data is unknown, but could be attributed to higher inhibitor sensitivity of truncated (enzyme assay) versus full-length (cellular) CRAF. Alternatively, cellular factors may exist that modify CRAF conformation, preventing its binding to dabrafenib. We also cannot exclude the possibility of a cellular compensatory mechanism, or a combination of all factors described above. We demonstrated high selectivity of dabrafenib for 80% of the BRAF V600E cell lines tested and hypothesize that the relative lack of activity (gIC 50>2 \u00a5\u00ecM) against 3 of the BRAF V600E cell lines may be due to the presence of additional mutations (PTEN in GCT cells, PI3K in RKO cells, and p53 in A673 cells) that were confirmed by in-house sequencing. Full sequencing data for these and other cell lines used in this study can be found at the Cancer Genome Workbench (CGWB) portal of the NCI (https://cgwb.nci.nih.gov/). Overexpression of proteins capable of driving cell growth/survival, or upregulation of efflux pump(s) could also serve to rescue cell growth from dabrafenib inhibition. While dabrafenib-sensitive BRAF V600E cell lines also occasionally encode other mutations, we maintain that BRAF V600E is the key oncogenic driver in these cells. We demonstrated that dabrafenib is also active against the activated BRAF V600K and BRAF V600D mutants at both the enzyme and cellular level. This is supported by recent clinical observations where patients with BRAF V600D/E/K tumors responded to GSK2118436 (dabrafenib) treatment [38]. We also observed slight dabrafenib sensitivity (gIC 50 from 263 nM to 6.9 \u00a5\u00ecM) of 18 cell lines lacking a BRAF-activating mutation and containing wild-type RAS. While no common mutations were identified between these cell lines, we speculate that activating mutation or overexpression of upstream BRAF drivers could result in BRAF-dependent cell proliferation. Additionally, while dabrafenib is very selective, we can\u00a1\u00aft exclude off-target effects that may result in sensitivity to dabrafenib. Dabrafenib shows specific activity for cells containing activated mutant BRAF. In BRAF V600E cells, dabrafenib inhibits MEK and ERK activation in a concentration-dependent manner, with similar, low nM activity (Figure S2). We confirmed that in a BRAF V600E cell line (A375P), ARAF or CRAF knockdown had no effect on MAPK activation. However, dabrafenib inhibited pMEK and pERK in a manner similar to that caused by BRAF depletion, confirming an on-target mechanism for dabrafenib as MAPK activation is BRAF-dependent in BRAF V600E cells. Surprisingly, ARAF or CRAF depletion diminished MAPK inhibition by dabrafenib, suggesting that ARAF or CRAF absence may allow increased formation of highly active BRAF V600E homodimers, and fewer ARAF/BRAF V600E or CRAF/BRAF V600E heterodimers. Alternatively, ARAF or CRAF depletion might induce a relaxation of negative feedback loops. Slightly lower levels of MEK and ERK were observed with BRAF siRNA in lanes 4 and 7, but not with dabrafenib alone in lane 2, despite its ability to induce cell death. However, cells were only exposed to dabrafenib for 1 h, which is not sufficient to reduce intact protein content through apoptosis, while siRNA treatment was for 72 h. In summary, these data clearly support the specific cellular selectivity of dabrafenib for activated mutant BRAF in cancer cells. In vivo pharmacodynamic marker modulation and tumor growth inhibition by dabrafenib were demonstrated in human BRAF V600E tumor xenograft models. ERK inhibition was rapid (2 h post-dosing) and surprisingly sustained at times (18 h post-dosing on days 7 and 14) when the circulating dabrafenib concentration was below that required for inhibition in cell culture. This could not be explained by tumor accumulation of the drug (data not shown), but might be attributed to the presence of circulating active dabrafenib metabolites. In vivo inhibition of MAPK signalling correlated with decreased tumor cell growth and dose-dependent tumor regression was observed with continuous drug exposure, supporting an on-target mechanism for dabrafenib. We demonstrated that dabrafenib could elevate pMEK and pERK in a CRAF-dependent manner in cells encoding mutant RAS, but wild-type RAF, and which are also dependent on the MAPK pathway for growth (sensitive to MEK inhibition). Paradoxical activation of MAPK signalling by BRAF inhibitors has been shown to be dependent upon RAS activity [22], where only one member of the RAF dimer is inhibited. It is therefore likely that dabrafenib-inhibited wild-type BRAF or CRAF in HCT-116 cells is binding to an uninhibited wild-type CRAF protomer in a RAS-dependent manner, resulting in elevated MAPK signalling. Since our data in HCT-116 cells (Figure 6) showed no effect with BRAF siRNA but abolition of dabrafenib-induced MAPK signalling by CRAF siRNA, this further supports the notion of CRAF dependence for paradoxical MAPK activation upon BRAF inhibitor treatment in an activated (mutant) RAS cell type. Since dabrafenib could elevate MAPK signalling in wild-type BRAF cells, we hypothesized that this could cause uncontrolled skin cell growth, leading to abnormalities such as the SCC as observed in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors [39]. We demonstrated BRAF inhibitor-induced occurrence of skin lesions in a rat model using a structurally similar tool compound to dabrafenib and showed that co-treatment with a MEK inhibitor could prevent occurrence of this pathology. In addition to a reduced potential for BRAF inhibitor-activated growth of wild-type RAF cells, the combination of dabrafenib with a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) showed enhanced efficacy in a BRAF V600E tumor xenograft model. Although dabrafenib administration was sustained (33 days at 30 mg/kg and 43 days at 300 mg/kg), tumor growth inhibition was observed only for a short period (14 and 20 days, respectively), followed by tumor re-growth, albeit at a slower rate than in untreated animals (Figure 7B), suggesting that a resistance mechanism develops upon constant drug exposure. Circulating drug in animals treated with 300 mg/kg dabrafenib was similar in concentration and profile at days 1, 70, and 84 (data not shown), suggesting that tumor re-growth did not result from time-dependent activation of dabrafenib metabolism. In a separate study (not shown), tumors growing upon extended dabrafenib treatment subsequently responded to a MEK inhibitor (trametinib), suggesting that the in vivo dabrafenib resistance mechanism in this experiment was ERK-dependent. Similar resistance mechanisms have been observed by others [40]?[43], including the recently identified involvement of a BRAF V600E p61 splice variant [44]. The possibility of an off-target mechanism, such as primary immune dysregulation, causing the observed BRAF inhibitor-induced skin hyperplasia also must not be ignored. However, the role of paradoxically activated MAPK signalling seems very likely given similar results with other RAF inhibitors of different chemical series [14]?[18]. Furthermore, recent studies have also shown an association between RAS mutation and SCC/keratoacanthoma formation in patients treated with RAF inhibitors [30], [45]. Consequently, we hypothesize that in clinical trials the MEK inhibitor concentration needed to inhibit undesired BRAF inhibitor-induced wild-type BRAF cell growth may also be lower than that required for single agent activity, reducing the potential for undesirable toxicity from either inhibitor, including a reduction in SCC incidence. To this end, clinical trials to test the combination of both agents dabrafenib (GSK2118436) and trametinib (GSK1120212) are currently ongoing in patients with melanoma. Recent data from a phase 1/2 trial have indeed shown that the combination of dabrafenib with trametinib at full monotherapy doses significantly improved progression-free survival (p<0.001) and the rate of complete or partial responses observed (p=0.03) [46]. Furthermore, the occurrence of skin lesions was also reduced, as hypothesized, albeit nonsignificantly (p=0.09) and with increased pyrexia. However, taken together this combination provides tremendous promise for patients with tumors expressing oncogenic mutant BRAF. Supporting Information. Figure S1.

                "text": "Complementary Genomic Screens Identify SERCA as a Therapeutic Target in NOTCH1 Mutated Cancer\tNotch1 is a rational therapeutic target in several human cancers, but as a transcriptional regulator, it poses a drug discovery challenge. To identify Notch1 modulators, we performed two cell-based, high-throughput screens for small-molecule inhibitors and cDNA enhancers of a NOTCH1 allele bearing a leukemia-associated mutation. SERCA calcium channels emerged at the intersection of these complementary screens. SERCA inhibition preferentially impairs the maturation and activity of mutated Notch1 receptors and induces a G 0/G 1 arrest in NOTCH1-mutated human leukemia cells. A small-molecule SERCA inhibitor has on-target activity in two mouse models of human leukemia and interferes with Notch signaling in Drosophila. These studies \u00a1\u00b0credential\u00a1\u00b1 SERCA as a therapeutic target in cancers associated with NOTCH1 mutations. INTRODUCTION. Selective expression of transcription factors directs the hierarchical specification of the hematopoietic lineage, and acquired mutations that perturb the function of these factors have a central role in leukemia pathogenesis. A prime example involves Notch1, a surface receptor that is essential for T cell progenitor specification and maturation. Acquired mutations that activate Notch1 are found in 40% to 70% of childhood and adult T-ALL (Lee et al., 2005; Mansour et al., 2006; Weng et al., 2004). Moreover, recent reports identified NOTCH1 activating mutations in 10?15% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (Di Ianni et al., 2009; Puente et al., 2011) and mantle cell lymphoma (Kridel et al., 2012). Notch receptors regulate many aspects of normal development and tissue homeostasis (reviewed in (Kopan and Ilagan, 2009)). Mammalian Notch receptors are processed during maturation by a furin-like protease, leading to the formation of two, non-covalently associated subunits. Signaling is normally initiated by binding of the Notch ectodomain to a ligand of the DSL family expressed on a neighboring cell. This interaction triggers two additional, successive proteolytic cleavages in the Notch transmembrane subunit. The first, mediated by ADAM-10 or ADAM-17 (Brou et al., 2000), occurs within a juxtamembrane negative regulatory region (NRR) at a site that is protected in the Notch off state (Gordon et al., 2009; Gordon et al., 2007). This cleavage within the Notch transmembrane domain creates a short-lived intermediate that is primed for secondary cleavage by the \u00a5\u00e3-secretase complex, an event that liberates the intracellular domain of Notch1 (ICN). ICN translocates to the nucleus, associates with the DNA-binding factor RBPJ, and recruits coactivators of the Mastermind-like (MAML) family to activate expression of target genes. Each of the proteolytic steps involved in the activation of Notch receptors is a potential therapeutic target. Indeed, \u00a5\u00e3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have anti-TALL activity in vitro (Weng et al., 2004) and in vivo (Cullion et al., 2009; Real et al., 2009). The GSI MK-0752 was tested in a phase I clinical trial in patients with relapsed acute leukemia (DeAngelo et al., 2006). This trial was halted, however, due to gastrointestinal toxicity thought to be related to chronic pan-Notch receptor inhibition in gut progenitor cells (Wong et al., 2004). Thus, other approaches to Notch1 inhibition are desirable. Historically, it has been difficult to develop high-throughput assays for small molecules that disrupt protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions (Darnell, 2002). Recently, there has been renewed interest in cell-based screening to address the problem of \u00a1\u00b0undruggable\u00a1\u00b1 targets using various approaches (Carpenter, 2007; Inglese et al., 2007; Stegmaier et al., 2004). Gene Expression-based High-Throughput Screening (GE-HTS) is a chemical genomic approach in which gene expression signatures serve as surrogates for cellular states (Hahn et al., 2008; Stegmaier et al., 2004). One application of GE-HTS is for the identification of small molecules that modulate transcriptional signatures produced by aberrantly activated transcription factors (Corsello et al., 2009). A limitation of cell-based assays is that identifying the biologically relevant target of the small molecule can be a daunting task. One way to overcome this challenge is to design multiple, integrated cell-based screens and then to focus on common emerging hits. With the availability of genome-scale cDNA collections, over-expression screens have also proven to be powerful tools to probe biological pathways and to identify the protein targets of small molecules. Here, we used complementary GE-HTS and cDNA overexpression screens to search for small- molecule modulators of Notch1 signaling in T-ALL. RESULTS. Development of a GE-HTS Assay for Notch1 Inhibitors. Figure 1A outlines our approach. We first defined a robust Notch1 transcriptional signature for the GE-HTS assay. We selected a set of genes that defined the Notch1 activation state from genome-wide expression profiling of 7 NOTCH1-mutated T-ALL cell lines treated with the GSI compound E (Cpd E) (Palomero et al., 2006b). From a set of approximately 500 genes with differences of p<0.01 by two-sided Student\u00a1\u00afs t-test, 28 genes with mean fold changes >1.5 between the Notch1 on versus off states (Figure 1B) and 4 invariant control genes were selected and validated (Figure S1A). To confirm that the signature reports on Notch1 inhibition and not GSI-treatment per se, we transduced DND41 cells with Notch1-specific shRNA and demonstrated induction of the Notch1 off signature (Figures S1B?D). This is consistent with prior work in which we showed that GE-HTS identified a Notch1 off signature in T-ALL cells treated with a Notch1-specific inhibitory antibody (Aste-Amezaga et al., 2010). To ensure that the signature does not identify generic growth inhibitors or cellular toxins, we treated DND41 cells with drugs known to be active against T-ALL cells. These drugs inhibited growth but did not induce the Notch1 off signature (Figure S1E?F). Identification of Small Molecules that Modulate Notch1. We screened 3801 drugs or drug-like compounds in the human T-ALL cell line DND41. GE-HTS data was collected after 72 hr of treatment as previously described (Peck et al., 2006). Because true positives are more likely to score by multiple scoring metrics, we applied a consensus classification system requiring hits to score in multiple algorithms: summed score, weighted summed score, K-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes classification and support vector machine (Figure 1C, Figure S1G) (Banerji et al., 2012). A total of 16 compounds (Table S1) selected for validation based on these criteria were retested in a two-fold dose-response series in DND41, MOLT4 and PF382 cell lines. Notably, multiple compounds reported to modulate calcium ion flux scored as dose-dependent Notch pathway inhibitors in all of the cell lines tested (Figure S1H?J). A cDNA Library Screen Identifies SERCA as a Notch Signaling Enhancer. A complementary cDNA library screen for factors that enhance the signaling activity of the Notch1 mutant L1601P\u00a5\u00c4P was simultaneously conducted in the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS. L1601P\u00a5\u00c4P contains the same heterodimerization mutation that is present in the MOLT4 and KOPTK1 cell lines in cis with a PEST domain deletion (Chiang et al., 2008), a combination that is found in approximately 10?15% of human T-ALL (Weng et al., 2004). U2OS cells were selected for the screen because they are readily transfected and have very low basal Notch signaling tone, a feature that produces favorable signal-to-noise ratios. A total of 18,000 open-reading frames were scored for their ability to enhance L1601P\u00a5\u00c4P-dependent activation of a Notch luciferase reporter. Among the top hits were ATP2A1, ATP2A2 and ATP2A3 (Figure 1D), which encode SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3, respectively. SERCAs are closely related, inwardly directed, ATP-dependent calcium pumps that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum. Retesting confirmed that ATP2A2 and ATP2A3 potentiate L1601P\u00a5\u00c4P-dependent signaling (Figure 1E). Of note, loss-of-function mutations in a Drosophila SERCA homolog, Ca-P60A, have been reported to produce Notch loss-of-function phenotypes in this model organism by altering Notch trafficking (Periz and Fortini, 1999). Thus, calcium modulators emerged at the nexus of two complementary screens. Thapsigargin Targets the Notch Pathway. One of the small molecules that scored in our GE-HTS screen across four scoring metrics was thapsigargicin, an analog of thapsigargin, a highly potent natural product inhibitor of SERCA. Low nanomolar concentrations of thapsigargin induced the Notch1 off signature in a dose-dependent fashion in NOTCH1 mutant T-ALL cells (Figure 2A) and reduced the expression of the direct Notch1 target genes MYC, HES1 and DTX1 (Figure 2B). Subnanomolar concentrations of thapsigargin also inhibited the expression of a Notch reporter by L1601P\u00a5\u00c4P in U2OS cells (Figure 2C). Notch1 inhibition results in G 0/G 1 arrest in human T-ALL cells (Weng et al., 2004) and decreased T-ALL cell size (Palomero et al., 2006b; Weng et al., 2006). As expected, thapsigargin also induced a G 0/G 1 arrest (Figure 3A) and a decrease in cell size (Figure 3B) in NOTCH1-mutated T-ALL cell lines. We next studied the effect of thapsigargin in a panel of T-ALL cell lines that contain activating mutations in the heterodimerization domain (HD) of Notch1 and/or deletions in the degradation domain (PEST). Three T-ALL cell lines reported to be highly sensitive to GSI (ALL/SIL, DND41, and KOPTK1) were more sensitive to thapsigargin as measured by inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis compared to two cell lines with intermediate sensitivity to GSI (MOLT4 and PF382) (Figure 3C). Furthermore, 24 hr of thapsigargin treatment decreased ICN1 levels in T-ALL cells (Figure 4A). As a further test of the idea that thapsigargin acts by preventing Notch1 activation, the Notch1-dependent T-ALL cell lines MOLT4 and DND41 were transduced with an empty MigR1 vector or with MigR1-ICN1 (Figure 4B). Transduction of ICN1, which lies downstream of the \u00a5\u00e3-secretase cleavage step in Notch activation, prevented induction of the Notch1 off signature (Figure 4C), growth inhibition (Figure 4D), G 0/G 1 cell cycle arrest (Figure 4E) and induction of apoptosis (Figure 4F) by thapsigargin. In contrast, empty MigR1 had no effect on these readouts of Notch inhibition. These results are consistent with a Notch pathway inhibitory effect of thapsigargin at low nanomolar concentrations. Thapsigargin Interferes with Notch1 Maturation. Multiple compounds scoring in our screen, including thapsigargin, are predicted to alter intracellular calcium. For example, thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid are known Ca 2+ATPase inhibitors, impairing calcium entry into the endoplasmic reticulum. Of note, multiple EGF repeats and all three Lin12/Notch repeats in the extracellular domains of Notch receptors require calcium ions for proper folding (Aster et al., 1999; Gordon et al., 2007; Hambleton et al., 2004; Rand et al., 1997). We thus hypothesized that thapsigargin, by altering ER Ca 2+ concentrations, would inhibit Notch1 maturation in T-ALL cells. To test this hypothesis, we first determined if thapsigargin affected furin processing of Notch1, an event that occurs in the late Golgi compartment. Lysates from T-ALL cell lines treated with thapsigargin were immunoblotted with an antibody specific for the cytoplasmic portion of Notch1 that recognizes both unprocessed Notch1 (~270 kDa) and the furin-processed transmembrane subunit (~110 kDa). Thapsigargin reduced the levels of the furin-processed transmembrane Notch1 subunit, but not the unprocessed full-length Notch1 precursor, in multiple T-ALL cell lines (Figures 5A). Similar results were observed with the less potent SERCA inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (Figure S2). Misfolded Notch1 receptors are expected to be retained in the ER/Golgi compartment. Immunostaining revealed that thapsigargin treatment reduced the levels of Notch1 on the cell surface (Figure 5B and C) and resulted in the co-localization of Notch1 and giantin, a Golgi membrane protein (Figure 5D). Thus, thapsigargin leads to defective Notch1 maturation in cultured T-ALL cells. SERCA Antagonism Inhibits Notch Function and T-ALL Growth In Vivo. To confirm that chemical and genetic inhibition of SERCA lead to Notch inactivation in vivo, we evaluated a Drosophila intestinal stem cell model in which Notch inhibition perturbs differentiation. The adult midgut is maintained by pluripotent stem cells that give rise to two populations of terminally differentiated daughter cells: a large class of polyploid enterocyes (EC) and a smaller class of diploid enteroendocrine (ee) cells (Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006; Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007). The stem cells express escargot (esg), a transcription factor, and Delta, a membrane bound ligand of the Notch receptor. High levels of Notch activation are required for daughter cells to adopt the EC cell fate, whereas lower levels of Notch activation specify daughters to adopt the ee fate. Thus, when Notch is completely inhibited, daughter cells fail to differentiate and remain as stem cells. By contrast, when Notch signaling is partially inhibited, daughter cells fail to differentiate into ECs and instead remain as stem cells or differentiate into ee cells. To enhance the sensitivity of fly-based drug assays, we used transgenic flies that express a human RAF gain-of-function cDNA (RAF(gof)) in their intestinal stem cells. Expression of the RAF(gof) cDNA results in rapid expansion of the esg+ population, which is composed of not only diploid stem cells but also polyploid EC daughter cells. When Notch is inhibited by feeding flies the GSI DAPT or Cpd E, stem cell daughters fail to differentiate into EC cells and instead give rise mostly to additional stem cells, as well as some ee daughters (Figure 6A). Cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin treatment also expanded the stem cell and ee cell populations, thus phenocopying the effects of GSI (Figure 6B). If thapsigargin inhibits Notch signaling through effects on calcium channels, then genetic modulation of SERCA should produce similar phenotypes. Indeed, knockdown of Ca-P60A, the only SERCA expressed in Drosophila, produced effects on stem cell and ee cell pools similar to those induced by GSI, thapsigargin, or cyclopiazonic acid treatment (Figure 6C). Thus, the results of chemical and genetic studies are consistent with a model in which SERCA inhibition by thapsigargin impairs Notch signaling in vivo. We next tested thapsigargin in a human T-ALL xenograft model. Systemic administration of thapsigargin to SCID-beige mice bearing MOLT-4 tumors inhibited tumor growth compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figure 6D). In addition, ICN1 protein levels were diminished in the thapsigargin-treated tumors compared to vehicle-treated tumors (Figure 6E and S3A), linking growth inhibition to Notch inhibition. To further demonstrate that thapsigargin impairs leukemic progression via Notch signaling inhibition we established a second T-ALL xenograft model in which DND41 cells were transduced with MigR1 or MigR1-ICN1 and subsequently propagated in NSG mice. Thapsigargin treatment markedly decreased the growth of control tumors but had little effect on tumors expressing ICN1 (Figure 6F and G), indicating that tumor growth suppression by thapsigargin is mediated by inhibition of Notch1 signaling in the leukemic cells. Prior studies demonstrated that gastrointestinal toxicity and lack of sustained response were the major limitations of first generation GSIs (DeAngelo et al., 2006). It was hypothesized that gastrointestinal toxicity was due to blockade of wild-type Notch1 and Notch2 in the gut leading to intestinal secretory metaplasia, increased number of goblet cells and arrested proliferation in the crypts of the small intestine (Milano et al., 2004; Real et al., 2009). Mice treated with thapsigargin did not develop gastrointestinal toxicity (Figure S3B and C), suggesting that HD-mutated Notch1 receptors were more sensitive to the effects of thapsigargin than wild-type Notch1/Notch2 receptors expressed in normal cells. These pre-clinical studies support SERCA as a possible therapeutic target in T-ALL. NOTCH1 Mutational Status Influences Thapsigargin Sensitivity. The results above suggest that thapsigargin inhibits signaling through wild-type and mutated Notch receptors but may have stronger effect for mutated Notch1. Prior work has shown that many activating HD mutations found in T-ALL result in destabilization of the Notch negative regulatory region and have deleterious effects on Notch1 folding and maturation (Malecki et al., 2006). Because the LNR repeats of the Notch negative regulatory region rely on calcium for folding and function (Aster et al., 1999), mutated Notch1 might be more sensitive to reduced calcium availability than the wild-type Notch1, providing a therapeutic window for SERCA inhibitors. One simple prediction of the above model is that constitutively active forms of Notch1 lacking Ca2+ binding modules should be insensitive to SERCA inhibitors. To test this prediction, we performed Notch1 reporter assays in U2OS cells transfected with a plasmid encoding \u00a5\u00c4EGF\u00a5\u00c4LNR, a membrane-tethered form of Notch1 lacking the extracellular EGF repeats and Lin12/Notch repeats, or ICN1. As anticipated, co-expression of SERCA did not enhance reporter gene activation by \u00a5\u00c4EGF\u00a5\u00c4LNR (Figure 7A), nor was reporter gene activation by \u00a5\u00c4EGF\u00a5\u00c4LNR (Figure 7B) or ICN1 (Figure 7C) affected by thapsigargin. In contrast, \u00a5\u00c4EGF\u00a5\u00c4LNR was highly sensitive to GSI (Figure 7B). Taken together, these results indicate that at low nanomolar concentrations thapsigargin inhibits Notch1 through a mechanism that requires the Ca 2+-binding modules of the Notch1 extracellular domain. To determine if the Notch1 extracellular domain is important for the ability of thapsigargin to inhibit leukemia cell growth, we studied the human T-ALL cell line SUPT1, which has two copies of a t(7;9)(q34, q34) fusing the 3\u00a1\u00c7 end of NOTCH1 with enhancer/promoter elements of the T-cell receptor \u00a5\u00e2 locus (T) CRB and has no normal NOTCH1 allele (Ellisen et al., 1991). The rearranged NOTCH1 alleles in SUPT1 cells drive the expression of a series of truncated mRNAs encoding N-terminally deleted polypeptides lacking the Notch1 extracellular domain, some of which are inserted into membranes and require \u00a5\u00e3-ecretase cleavage for activation (Das et al., 2004). As anticipated, thapsigargin had no effect on ICN1 levels in SUPT1 cells (Figure 7D), whereas Cpd E eliminates the generation of ICN1 (Figure 7E). This result prompted us to speculate that protein structure might affect drug response. Thapsigargin failed to inhibit wild-type Notch1 or Notch2 at concentrations that impaired signaling of Notch1 bearing leukemogenic HD mutations (Figure 7F). To further test whether thapsigargin inhibits wild-type Notch1 maturation we tested two Notch1 wild-type T-ALL and one chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines in which high expression of Notch1 was previously reported (Palomero et al., 2006a). Compared to HD mutant, wild-type proteins appear to be less affected by thapsigargin treatment (Figures 8A, B, and C). The effects of thapsigargin on cell viability were then determined in a larger panel of human T-ALL cell lines of known NOTCH1 mutational status (Weng et al., 2004). Cell lines carrying NOTCH1 alleles with HD domain mutations were more sensitive to thapsigargin than cells with wild-type NOTCH1 alleles or lacking the Notch1 extracellular domain (Figure 8D?F). In summary, these data suggest that Notch1 receptors bearing leukemogenic HD domain mutations are more sensitive to SERCA inhibitors, such as thapsigargin, than normal receptors. DISCUSSION. Integrating Cell-based Screens for Small Molecule and Protein Target Discovery. While there is a strong rationale for target-based therapies for cancer, with the exception of the nuclear hormone receptors, transcription factors have largely been refractory to conventional small-molecule screening approaches due to the challenges in developing high-throughput, robust screening assays. By definition, any therapeutic agent that modulates a transcription factor must alter the expression of its target genes. While there have been significant advances in our ability to assess global gene expression changes, almost all existing approaches cannot yet be applied to large-scale screening efforts due to cost and throughput limitations. Recognizing these shortcomings, we developed an approach that allows measuring the expression of hundreds of endogenous genes in 384-well format and applied it to identify antagonists of leukemogenic increases in Notch signaling in T-ALL. A limitation of both phenotypic and expression-based screening, however, is that identification of the relevant target of lead compounds can be difficult. The development of alternative genomic and chemical proteomic approaches for identifying protein targets holds the promise of accelerating the elucidation of underlying mechanism. Integrating results of a cDNA screen with GE-HTS data allowed us to identify SERCAs as Notch1 modulators and potential therapeutic targets in Notch1-associated leukemias. Altering Maturation of Mutant Notch1 by SERCA Inhibition. We show here that SERCA inhibitors such as thapsigargin cause a Notch1 maturation defect marked by the accumulation of unprocessed Notch1 in the ER/Golgi compartment. The resulting effects on Notch1 signaling and leukemia cell growth depend on the nature of the NOTCH1 mutations. The most common activating NOTCH1 mutations in human T-ALL consist of point substitutions or small in-frame deletions or insertions in the extracellular heterodimerization domain, which disrupt heterodimerization domain structure and permit ligand-independent ADAM-type metalloprotease cleavages (Gordon et al., 2009; Malecki et al., 2006), the so-called Class I NOTCH1 mutations. Folding and maturation of Notch1 are partially impaired by these mutations (Malecki et al., 2006), and it appears that Notch1 receptors bearing such mutations are more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of thapsigargin than wild-type Notch1 receptors. Another possible contributing factor to the greater sensitivity to thapsigargin in cells with mutated Notch1 receptors is that the presence of these mutated polypeptides may itself engender ER stress and thus render these cells more susceptible to the ER stress induced by thapsigargin. Indeed, this may account for the inability to fully rescue the effects of thapsigargin with ICN1 in some of our experiments. Taken together, these data suggest the potential for a therapeutic window for thapsigargin in T-ALLs bearing this type of mutation. Other types of activating NOTCH1 mutations also exist. Rarely, juxtamembrane in-frame tandem duplications create new \u00a1\u00b0deprotected\u00a1\u00b1 ADAM-metalloprotease cleavage sites (Class II mutations) (Malecki et al., 2006), or translocations create NOTCH1 alleles encoding polypeptides that lack the Notch1 extracellular domain (Ellisen et al., 1991; Palomero et al., 2006a). As anticipated, we observed that a T-ALL cell line with two translocated NOTCH1 alleles is relatively resistant to thapsigargin. Our proposed mechanism of action also predicts that murine T-ALLs, which often have Notch1 deletions that remove the Notch1 ectodomain coding sequence (Ashworth et al., 2010), as well as uncommon human breast cancers with NOTCH1 rearrangements (Robinson et al., 2011), will be more resistant to thapsigargin and other SERCA inhibitors. It will be of importance to determine if CLLs, which have recently been reported to have frequent Notch1 PEST domain deletions (Di Ianni et al., 2009; Puente et al., 2011) but lack heterodimerization domain mutations, are sensitive to SERCA inhibitors. Connecting NOTCH1 and SERCA Mutations in Human Disease. Germline mutations in ATP2A1 are reported in the congenital disorder Brody syndrome, characterized by impaired muscle relaxation and myopathy (Odermatt et al., 1996). ATP2A2 mutations are reported in Darier\u00a1\u00afs disease (Sakuntabhai et al., 1999), an autosomal dominant skin disorder characterized by loss of adhesion between keratinocytes, scaling due to hyperkeratosis, and thickening of the epidermis due to keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Skin cancers have been reported in patients with Darier\u00a1\u00afs disease (Robertson and Sauder, 2012). Moreover, in aged Atp2a2 +/? mice, tumors develop from the keratinized squamous epithelia (Liu et al., 2001) while the wild-type Atp2a2 allele is retained and expressed, supporting a role for SERCA2 haploinsufficiency in tumor development (Prasad et al., 2005). In addition, thapsigargin acts as a tumor promoter in a skin carcinogenesis mouse model (Hakii et al., 1986). There is also mounting evidence that Notch signaling suppresses the transformation of squamous epithelial cells. Genetically engineered mice with decrements in Notch signaling in the skin have a high incidence of skin cancers (Nicolas et al., 2003; Proweller et al., 2006). Recent human clinical trial data revealed that semagacestat, a GSI, is associated with an increased risk of skin cancer (discussed in (Crump et al., 2011)), possibly due to inhibition of Notch in the skin by chronic GSI administration. Furthermore, Notch pathway loss-of-function mutations have been reported in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (Agrawal et al., 2011; Stransky et al., 2011), skin and lung (Wang et al., 2011). Of note, at least one NOTCH1 point substitution in human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma impairs Ca 2+-binding and folding of EGF repeat 12 (Hambleton et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2011) and a second (R1549Q) impacts folding of the LNRs (Wang et al., 2011), thus recapitulating the proposed pharmacologic effect of thapsigargin. Additional murine studies indicate that Notch signaling may have a tumor suppressive function in other cell lineages as well, including myeloid progenitors (Klinakis et al., 2011) and endothelial cells (Liu et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2010). Intriguingly, several recent studies report SERCA mutations in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Korosec et al., 2008; Stransky et al., 2011), in AML (Yan et al., 2011), and in other malignancies (Korosec et al., 2009), implicating loss-of-function mutations of SERCA as an additional possible mechanism for Notch inactivation in these diseases. Indeed, while NOTCH1 mutations enhance sensitivity to SERCA inhibitors, providing a potential therapeutic window for application of this compound class, wild-type Notch1 is also sensitive to SERCA inhibition but at higher concentrations of the compound. One hypothesis to explain a Notch1 and SERCA functional dependency is by a physical interaction. It has been previously shown that presenilin and SERCA2b co-localize in the endoplasmic reticulum (Green et al., 2008). Since presenilin immunoprecipitation is also reported to preferentially recover the full length Notch1 precursor prior to Notch1 cleavage in the Golgi (Ray et al., 1999), it is possible that Notch1, SERCA and presenilin are part of a macromolecular complex. Toward Translating SERCA Inhibitors to the Clinic. Our studies and other recent work bring to light a challenge in targeting Notch1 in cancer: its pleiotropic roles. NOTCH1 is an oncogene in some human cancers, such as T-ALL and CLL, whereas it is a tumor suppressor in others, most notably squamous cell carcinomas. Several strategies have been explored to inhibit Notch1 including the use of GSIs, Notch1-directed antibodies, and direct inhibition of the Notch complex with a hydrocarbon stapling approach (reviewed in (Roti and Stegmaier, 2011)). Each of these, however, is anticipated to also inhibit wild-type Notch1. One strategy to mitigate potential cancer-promoting effects in non-diseased cells is intermittent dosing of Notch inhibitors. A second approach is the selective targeting of the oncogenic protein. Our results suggest that common heterodimerization domain mutations in Notch1 render the protein more susceptible to the thapsigargin-induced maturation defect, allowing for a therapeutic window in targeting mutant versus wild-type Notch1 (we observed an anti-leukemia effect with no measureable gut toxicity). The selective targeting of BRAF kinase bearing an activating V600E mutation by vemurafenib in melanoma is an example of successful application of this strategy (Bollag et al., 2010), although acquired resistance with RAS pathway lesions is common (Nazarian et al., 2010; Su et al., 2012). Similarly, reactivation of Notch1 signaling, for example, by altered EGF/LNR repeats, may pose a resistance mechanism in SERCA-targeted therapy in T-ALL. Given the pervasive role of calcium signaling in normal physiology, it is unlikely that pan-SERCA inhibitors, such as thapsigargin, will have an immediate clinical application unless additional development is pursued. One strategy might be the development of isoform-specific small-molecule inhibitors of SERCA. A second is to derivatize thapsigargin for specific delivery to T-ALL cells. This tactic has already been employed for a derivative of thapsigargin that is designed to treat prostate cancer, which is currently in clinical trials (NCT01056029 and NCT01734681) (Denmeade et al., 2003). Successful \u00a1\u00b0targeted\u00a1\u00b1 delivery of SERCA inhibitors to T-ALL cells would further improve the therapeutic window with this class of drugs and enhance the likelihood of clinical translation. In summary, this study demonstrates the power of an integrative screening strategy to identify alternative ways to target aberrant transcription factors, identify the modulation of SERCA as a tractable approach for inhibiting Notch1 in Notch-driven cancers, and implicate SERCA mutation as another potential pathogenic mechanism for Notch downregulation in human cancers in which the Notch pathway has a tumor suppressive role. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES. Full experimental details are in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Cell Culture, Compounds, and Antibodies. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cpd E, thapsigargin, and cyclopiazonic acid were obtained from ENZO Life Sciences and bepridil hydrochloride, ionomycin, salinomycin, methotrexate, dexamethasone, vincristine and DAPT from Sigma-Aldrich. Western blot antibodies against Notch1 were obtained from Cell Signaling and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Actin (Thermo Scientific), Vinculin (AbCAM) and GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies for IF include Notch1 [A6] and giantin (AbCAM). Cell surface Notch1 was evaluated by staining non-permeabilized cells with monoclonal anti-human Notch1 antibody (R&D). Notch1 Off Signature Detection. Marker and control genes for the Notch1 on vs. off signature were chosen using publicly available Affymetrix microarray expression profiling data sets (GEO: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE5716\",\"term_id\":\"5716\"}}GSE5716) (Palomero et al., 2006b). Probes are shown in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. The signature was adapted to GE-HTS as described (Peck et al., 2006). Signature performance was evaluated by calculating the summed score and weighted summed score (Hahn et al., 2008). Small-molecule Library Screening. DND41 cells were incubated with compounds at approximately 20 \u00a5\u00ecM in DMSO for 72 hr. We screened 3801 compounds in triplicate, including the BSPBio collection (Prestwick, Biomol, and Spectrum libraries) and the HSCI1 collection (Broad Institute). The GE-HTS assay was performed as described (Peck et al., 2006; Stegmaier et al., 2004). Compounds that induce the Notch1 off signature were identified using 5 discrete analytic metrics: summed score, weighted summed score, K-nearest neighbor analysis, naive Bayes classification, and support vector machine as described (Hahn et al., 2009). cDNA Library Screen and Validation. The cDNA screening strategy involved the use of three key components: 1) a pcDNA3 plasmid encoding a modestly strong NOTCH1 gain-of-function mutant, L1601P\u00a5\u00c4P, driven from a CMV promoter, 2) a Notch firefly luciferase reporter, and 3) a pre-plated cDNA library cloned into the Sport6 plasmid. Luminescence was measured 48 hr post-plating. Viral Transduction. Sequences targeted by each shRNA are listed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Viral supernatant production and MigR1 retroviral infections were performed as described (Aster et al., 2000). Cell Growth, Apoptosis and DNA Content Assays. Cell growth was assessed using the Promega Cell-Titer Glo ATP-based assay (Promega), apoptosis using a Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) or Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining by flow-cytometry (eBioscience), and cellular DNA content by staining with propidium iodide. Values for IC 10, IC 25, IC 50 were calculated using Prism 5 Software (version 5.03). Reporter Gene Assays. Expression plasmids for L1601P\u00a5\u00c4P (Weng et al., 2004), L1601P\u00a5\u00c4P-GAL4 (Malecki et al., 2006), \u00a5\u00c4EGF\u00a5\u00c4LNR (Chiang et al., 2008), and ICN1 (Aster et al., 2000) have been described. Co-transfection of U2OS cells with expression plasmids, a Notch firefly luciferase reporter gene, and an internal Renilla luciferase control gene, was performed as described (Aster et al., 2000). A second approach used a Notch1-Gal4 receptor ligand stimulation assay (Malecki et al., 2006). Real-time RT-PCR. Primers and probes for real-time RT-PCR were obtained from Applied Biosystems. The data were analyzed using the \u00a5\u00c4\u00a5\u00c4CT method and plotted as percentage of transcript compared to vehicle. Drosophila Experiments. To generate RAF(gof) tumors in the adult Drosophila midgut, we created a stock containing the X-linked UAS-RAF(gof) transgene (Brand and Perrimon, 1994) and the second chromosome-linked esg-Gal4, UAS-GFP, Tubulin, Gal80(ts) transgenes (Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006). Drugs were prepared in DMSO and mixed with fly food 1:100 and fed to flies for 7 days. Flies were given freshly prepared drug every 2?3 days. Drug effects were evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy. T-ALL Xenograft Studies. MOLT4 xenografts were established by injecting 1.7\u00a1\u00bf10 6 cells subcutaneously into 6-week-old female SCID-beige mice (Charles River Labs). Tumor volume was determined by caliper measurements using Vol=0.5 \u00a1\u00bf L \u00a1\u00bf W 2. When tumors reached a mean volume of 75 mm 3, mice were divided into two groups: thapsigargin 0.4 mg/Kg or vehicle by intraperitoneal injection daily. Three mice that died prematurely due to drug toxicity were excluded from the study, leaving 6 evaluable mice in the thapsigargin-treated arm and 9 in the vehicle arm. DND41 MigR1 and DND41 MigR1-ICN1 xenografts were established by injecting 10\u00a1\u00bf10 6 cells subcutaneously into NSG mice (n=20 per line). When tumor volume reached over 50 mm 3 mice were divided into two groups: thapsigargin 0.35 mg/Kg or vehicle 10 mL/Kg by intraperitoneal injection daily. Mice that were not ready at start of treatment were subsequently added to treatment groups when their tumors reached appropriate sizes. Mice were treated daily through the course of the study and tumors measured every three days. Five thapsigargin-treated mice were found dead during the course of the study with no prior weight loss or clinical signs of illness. All animal studies were performed under a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute IACUC-approved protocol. HIGHLIGHTS. SIGNIFICANCE. Notch1 is aberrant in many malignancies, with both gain and loss-of-function mutations reported, highlighting the need for therapies selectively targeting mutant Notch1 receptors. T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a high-risk leukemia in need of better treatment approaches, is one disease notable for frequent, activating mutations in NOTCH1. In this study we identify SERCA inhibition as an approach to selectively impair the maturation of mutant Notch1 receptors in T-ALL and demonstrate the anti-leukemia activity of this strategy both in vitro and in vivo. With increasing evidence of SERCA mutations in hereditary diseases and cancer, our study also suggests that aberrant SERCA activity might contribute to diseases linked to altered Notch signaling.

                "text": "Establishment of patient-derived non-small cell lung cancer xenograft models with genetic aberrations within EGFR, KRAS and FGFR1: useful tools for preclinical studies of targeted therapies\tBackground. Patient-derived tumor xenograft models have been established and increasingly used for preclinical studies of targeted therapies in recent years. However, patient-derived non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenograft mouse models are relatively few in number and are limited in their degree of genetic characterization and validation. In this study, we aimed to establish a variety of patient-derived NSCLC models and characterize these for common genetic aberrations to provide more informative models for preclinical drug efficacy testing. Methods. NSCLC tissues from thirty-one patients were collected and implanted into immunodeficient mice. Established xenograft models were characterized for common genetic aberrations, including detection of gene mutations within EGFR and KRAS, and genetic amplification of FGFR1 and cMET. Finally, gefitinib anti-tumor efficacy was tested in these patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models. Results. Ten passable patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models were established by implantation of NSCLC specimens of thirty-one patients into immunodeficient mice. Genetic aberrations were detected in six of the models, including one model with an EGFR activating mutation (Exon19 Del), one model with KRAS mutation, one model with both KRAS mutation and cMET gene amplification, and three models with FGFR1 amplification. Anti-tumor efficacy studies using gefitinib demonstrated that the EGFR activating mutation model had superior sensitivity and that the KRAS mutation models were resistant to gefitinib. The range of gefitinib responses in the patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models were consistent with the results reported from clinical trials. Furthermore, we observed that patient-derived NSCLC models with FGFR1 gene amplification were insensitive to gefitinib treatment. Conclusions. Ten patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models were established containing a variety of genetic aberrations including EGFR activating mutation, KRAS mutation, and FGFR1 and cMET amplification. Gefitinib anti-tumor efficacy in these patient-derived NSCLC xenografts containing EGFR and KRAS mutation was consistent with the reported results from previous clinical trials. Thus, data from our panel of patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models confirms the utility of these models in furthering our understanding of this disease and aiding the development of personalized therapies for NSCLC patients. Introduction. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [1] and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for over 80% of lung cancer deaths [2]. In addition to the traditional lung cancer treatments of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, molecularly targeted drugs such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib) [3], and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (crizotinib) [4] have recently emerged as viable therapeutic options. Preclinical evaluation of targeted therapies relies heavily on the use of animal tumor models [5,6], and the transplantation of standard tumor cell lines into mice to generate xenografts is common practice in preclinical drug discovery [7,8]. Unfortunately, following prolonged in vitro artificial culturing, these transplanted tumor cells often no longer maintain the original molecular characteristics and heterogeneity of the patient tumor [9,10]. One of the most profound issues with using standard xenograft models is their poor predictive power for the translation of preclinical efficacy into clinical outcome [11,12]. To overcome these disadvantages and build upon the industry\u00a1\u00afs repertoire of standard xenograft tumor models, patient-derived xenograft mouse models have been successfully established by implanting fresh patient tumor fragments into immunodeficient mice, subcutaneously or orthotopically, and used to evaluate targeted therapeutic drugs in recent decades [5,12-14]. To date, a variety of tumor models representing key disease segments have been established using fresh patient tumor tissues, including colorectal cancer (CRC) [15], pancreatic cancer [16], lung cancer [17], gastric cancer [18], esophageal cancer [19], hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [20] and others [13]. Recent evidence suggests that patient-derived xenograft mouse models can maintain certain pathological and molecular features of the original disease and patient tumor [20]. Compared to standard cell line-derived xenograft models, the greatest advantage of patient-derived xenograft models is their ability to better predict clinical tumor response [6]. Notably, Fiebig et al. described a high correlation (90~96%) between anti-tumor efficacy generated in patient-derived xenograft models and clinical response in patients. In many respects, patient-derived tumor xenograft models are increasingly being considered as more relevant models since the patient\u00a1\u00afs tumor grows as a solid entity, develops a functional stroma and vasculature, and displays central necrosis and reflects tumor differentiation [6]. In a recent comprehensive review, the many advantages of patient-derived tumor xenograft models were summarized thus: 1) an accurate reflection of the complexity and heterogeneity of human tumors, 2) maintenance of the molecular, genetic and histological heterogeneity typical of the original tumors through serial passaging in mice, 3) provision of an excellent in vivo preclinical platform to study cancer stem biology and stromal-tumor interactions, 4) presentation of an information-rich preclinical resource for the analysis of drug activity, including novel-novel drug combinations, as well as predictive biomarker discovery, and finally 5) provision of a more-relevant system to test clinically directed hypotheses [21]. Thus, these clinically-relevant animal tumor models are anticipated to increase the success of identifying new active antitumor agents for targeted therapy. Furthermore, the increased genetic diversity within these patient-derived xenograft models also provides opportunities to further develop personalized approaches for the treatment of NSCLC patients. To preclinically model the major disease segments within lung cancer, patient-derived NSCLC xenograft mouse models have been established, and further characterization has shown that these models accurately represent the patient\u00a1\u00afs genetic diversity and tumor morphology [17,22]. To our knowledge however, targeted therapeutic drugs such as the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib, have not been tested within a variety of patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models with differing genetic aberrations and compared with clinical trial outcome data. In this study, we established ten passable patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models from thirty-one implanted patient NSCLC samples. These contained a variety of genetic aberrations including: EGFR and KRAS gene mutations and genetic amplification of cMET and FGFR1. Within these models, gefitinib antitumor activity was generally poor, and tumor regression was only observed in a model containing an EGFR exon 19 deletion - consistent with previous preclinical studies and supportive of the current patient selection criteria for EGFR-targeted therapies, such as gefitinib and erlotinib. These clinically relevant NSCLC xenograft models thus provide useful tools for the evaluation and development of molecularly targeted therapeutic drugs for the treatment of NSCLC patients. Materials and methods. Patient samples. Thirty-one NSCLC patient specimens were obtained at initial surgery from primary diagnosed, early-stage NSCLC patients from Guangdong General Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient and the study was approved by the hospital ethics committee. Tumor pathology was diagnosed by hospital pathologist. Harvested fresh NSCLC specimens were separated into three parts: the first part was cut into fragments of around 15?mm 3 under sterile conditions and put into frozen medium, containing 90% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Cat#10099-141, Australia) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma, Cat#D2650, USA), and then stored in liquid nitrogen for later implantation; the second part of the specimen was snap frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for DNA/RNA extraction and the third part of the specimen was fixed in formalin (SCRC, Cat#10010018, China) and embedded into paraffin (Thermo Scientific, Cat#6774060, USA) for pathological assessment and model characterization. Establishment of patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models. 8-10-week-old female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) and nude (nu/nu) mice (Vital River, Beijing, China) were used in this study. All animal studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The patient-derived NSCLC xenograft mouse models were established using surgically removed tissues from NSCLC patients as described previously [5] and modified. Frozen NSCLC tissues in medium with 90% FBS were thawed at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and implanted into SCID mice subcutaneously via Trocar needle. The tumor-implanted mice were observed daily for 90?days. Tumors were measured once a week by caliper to determine subcutaneous growth rate. Xenografted NSCLC tumors (~500?mm 3) in SCID mice were further implanted into nude mice for further generations of these models. After three consecutive mouse-to-mouse passages, the xenograft models became stable and were then submitted for model characterization, including histopathology confirmation, gene mutation detection for EGFR and KRAS, and gene amplification for FGFR1 and cMET by detection of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. The tumor specimens in each passage of tumor-bearing mice were harvested and divided into three parts for the following purposes. The first part was implanted into nude mice for generation of the second xenograft passage. The second part was used for DNA/RNA extraction by snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. The third part was fixed in 10% formalin buffer for 24?hours and embedded in paraffin (FFPE) for gene amplification by FISH analysis. Larger amounts of fresh tumor fragments at passage 3?5 were frozen in the standard cell freezing medium and stored in liquid nitrogen for model banking. The patient-derived NSCLC xenograft mouse models were maintained in nude mice and used for anti-tumor efficacy studies, prior to reaching passage ten. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to confirm the histopathology of xenografts. Mutation detection. NSCLC patient tissues and xenograft tissues from the patient-derived NSCLC xenograft mouse models were pathologically reviewed to ensure that tumor cell content was more than 80% and that no significant tumor necrosis had occurred before extraction of DNA. Genomic DNA was extracted from each tissue sample using Puregene Cell and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Cat#158388, Germany). The quantity and purity of DNA samples were measured using Nanodrop ND-1000 UV/VIS Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). DNA fragment integrity was confirmed by electrophoresis using 1% agarose gel. The concentration of DNA samples were normalized to 20?ng/\u00a5\u00ecL and stored at ?20\u00a1\u00c6C until use. \u00a1\u00aeHot spot\u00a1\u00af mutations in EGFR (exons 18, 19, 20, 21) and KRAS (exons 2 and 3) were screened by amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) and mutant-enriched liquid chip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The former method and detection was supported by Amoy diagnostics Co. Ltd, Fujian, PR China, the latter method was performed at SurExam Bio-Tech Co. Ltd., Guangzhou Technology Innovation Base, Science City, Guangzhou, PR China. FGFR1 and MET gene amplification analysis by FISH assay. The FGFR1 FISH probe was generated internally (AstraZeneca) by directly labeling bacteria artificial chromosome (BAC) (CTD-2288?L6, Invitrogen, USA) DNA with Spectrum Red (Vysis, Cat# 30?803400, USA). The CEP8- Spectrum Green probe (Vysis, Cat#32-132008, USA) for the centromeric region of chromosome (CEP) 8 was used as internal control. For MET FISH probe generation, BAC (CTD-2270?N20, Invitrogen, USA) DNA was used and CEP7-Spectrum Green probe (Vysis, Cat#06?J37-007, USA) as internal control. FISH assays were performed on 4 micron dewaxed and dehydrated FFPE sections. The SpotLight Tissue pretreatment Kit (Invitrogen, Cat#00-8401, USA) was used for pretreatment (boiled in reagent 1 for ~15?minutes then coated with reagent 2 for ~10?minutes, minor time adjustments were made for individual samples). Sections and probes were codenaturated at 80\u00a1\u00c6C for 5?minutes and then hybridized at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 48?hours. After a quick post wash off process (0.3%NP40/1xSSC at 75.5\u00a1\u00c6C for 5?minutes, twice in 2\u00a1\u00bfsaline sodium citrate [SSC] at room temperature for 2?minutes), sections were finally mounted with 0.3?\u00a5\u00ecg/ml 4\u00a1\u00af,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector, Cat# H-1200, USA), and stored at 4\u00a1\u00c6C avoiding light for at least 30?minutes prior to scoring. Target gene and CEP signals were observed using fluorescence microscope equipped with the appropriate filters allowing visualization of the intense red target gene signals, the intense green chromosome centromere signals, and the blue counterstained nuclei. Enumeration of the FGFR1 or MET gene and chromosome 8 or 7 was conducted by microscopic examination of 50 tumor nuclei, which yielded a ratio of FGFR1 to CEP8 or MET/CEP7. Tumors with ratio \u00a1\u00c32 or presence of \u00a1\u00c310% gene cluster were defined as amplification. Anti-tumor activity. Tumor growth curves in all patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models were generated by kinetic measurement of tumor volumes subcutaneously. For therapeutic experiments, the tumor volume range of 150 to 250?mm 3 in tumor-bearing nude mice were sorted randomly (6~8 animals per group) and assigned to vehicle control or gefitinib treatment groups by oral dosing at 100?mg/kg (AstraZeneca, AZ10027436, England). Subcutaneous tumor volumes in nude mice and mouse body weights were measured twice a week. Tumor volumes were calculated by measuring two perpendicular diameters with calipers. Tumor volumes (TV) calculated by the formula: TV=(length\u00a1\u00bfwidth 2)/2. Percentage of tumor growth inhibition (%TGI) was calculated as the formula: {1 ? [change of tumor volume in treatment group/change of tumor volume in control group]}\u00a1\u00bf100 and was used for the evaluation of anti-tumor efficacy. Statistical analysis. To find out clinical parameters that contribute to the success of model establishment, logistic regression was used to assess the association of success rate of model establishment with clinic-pathological parameters. A patient tissue that can be successfully turned into a xenograft model is defined as 1 and 0 otherwise. P values from univariate models were computed from log-likelihood ratio test. Factors that show significant results from univariate analysis were considered in multivariate analysis to adjust for imbalance of covariates, including gender, histological type and smoking status. The data analysis was performed using R version 2.11.0 on Unix. To evaluate the statistic significance in anti-tumor efficacy study, Student\u00a1\u00afs t-test was used to compare TGI in treatment group to the control group. Statistical tests were two sided, with P<0.05 considered significant. Results. Establishment of patient-derived NSCLC xenograft mouse models. Thirty-one patient NSCLC specimens were harvested and implanted subcutaneously into SCID mice. Ten patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models from the thirty-one implantations were established in consecutive passages in nude mice (Table?1). NSCLC patient clinical information is also listed in Table?1. None of the patients received any therapies prior to surgery. The original patient NSCLC tissues were implanted into SCID mice subcutaneously and then growing xenograft tissues were implanted into nude mice starting from the second generation of models. The model success rate was 45% (14/31) in the first generation of SCID mice, and then 32% (10/31) in the second and subsequent generations. After the second generation, patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models became stable without further changes in model survival and tumor take-on rates. All ten established patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models showed kinetic growth curves in passage 3 (Figure?1). Examination of autopsies in NSCLC-bearing mice from these xenograft mouse models at 2~3?months post-implantation revealed no evidence of metastases in brain, lung, liver or kidney. The xenograft tissues were analyzed by H&E staining for pathology assessment. The patient-derived NSCLC xenograft tissues exhibited similar morphology to that of the patient tissues from which the primary models were derived (data not shown). Following this, established patient NSCLC xenografts were submitted for model characterization and further validation by targeted therapy. Results of the correlation analysis between model establishment success rate and patient clinical parameters are listed in Table?2. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor histological subtype was the only parameter which had significant impact on the success rate of model establishment. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was much more prone to be tumorigenic in nude mice compared to adenocarcinoma (AC). Other factors, including sex, smoking status, pathologic grade and mutation, did not correlate with model success rate; although univariate analysis showed that sex and smoking status have a significant impact when these parameters are considered alone. Genetic aberrations within patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models. Mutation of EGFR, KRAS and gene amplification of FGFR1 and cMET were screened for in all 31 patient samples and ten established xenograft samples. One model with an EGFR activating mutation (Exon19Del) and two models with KRAS mutations (G12S and Q61H) were identified in the ten patient-derived NSCLC models and their corresponding patient NSCLC tissues (Table?3). Furthermore, gene amplification of FGFR1 was detected in additional three models and cMET in one model (KRAS mutant background). Again, these genetic aberrations were identified in both patient-derived NSCLC models and their corresponding patient NSCLC tissues (Table?3 and Figure?2), with the exception of one model (L123) which lacked sufficient patient LC tissue for analysis. Gefitinib antitumor activity. To validate and confirm whether these patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models showed similar responses to gefitinib treatment as compared to that reported in clinical trials, eight of the ten established xenograft models were treated with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Table?3 and Figure?3). Xenograft model L115 which harbored an EGFR activating mutation (Exon19Del), responded completely to gefitinib treatment (tumors regressed completely during the treatment period). Interestingly, these tumors remained almost indistinguishable for nearly 40?days following cessation of gefitinib dosing. Xenograft model L030, with a KRAS mutation and EGFR wild type gene, showed a minor response to gefitinib treatment (25% tumor growth inhibition (TGI)). A further KRAS mutation model (L023) with cMET gene amplification had no response to gefitinib treatment. Not surprisingly, the patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models, L121 & L123 with FGFR1 gene amplification were insensitive to gefitinib treatment (Table?3 and Figure?3), likely due to a tumor-dependence on FGFR pathway signaling [23,24]. Additional models, L104 and L004 with wild type EGFR and KRAS but without FGFR1 and cMET gene amplification showed moderate response to gefitinib, ranging from 46% to 113% TGI (Table?3 and Figure?3). Discussion. As NSCLC remains one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide [1,2,25], we urgently need to improve our understanding of the disease and assess whether novel patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models can more faithfully represent clinical disease and gauge response to targeted therapies. We established ten patient-derived NSCLC xenograft mouse models derived from frozen patient tissues and characterized these models for relevant gene mutations and amplifications. In previous reports, patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models were established by implanting fresh patient tumor tissues with success rates ranging from 25~40% [5,22]. To establish whether frozen tumor tissues could also be used to generate patient-derived xenograft models, we directly implanted frozen patient NSCLC tissues into mice. Using this method, we achieved a success rate of 32% (10/31 implantation), within a similar range to that achieved using fresh tissue implantation. An obvious benefit of this method however, is that patient tumor tissues can be collected at multiple medical centers, frozen on site and shipped to a central animal facility for model establishment, characterization and testing. Here, as with others [5,13], we have shown that implantation of human NSCLC tissue (in our case frozen tissue) can be viable and lead to successful model development in SCID mice. In our experience however, nude mice models are preferable in drug discovery due to their superior tolerability of drug agents and hence, we transferred our established patient-derived NSCLC models from SCID to nude mice. Our studies demonstrated that 71% (10/14) of our xenograft models in SCID mice could be successfully transferred to nude mice starting from the 2nd generation. After the third generation, in our study the models became more stable in terms of both tumor take-on and success rates. To date, the major factors which affect the success rates of establishing patient-derived xenograft models in mice are still unclear. We suggest that tumor type may be one of the key factors. Clearly, SCC is easier to grow up in mice than AC [22], and higher success rates have been observed in establishing SCC patient-derived xenograft tumor models compared to all other types of patient-derived tumor [22]. Thomas John et al. have recently demonstrated that patient samples with EGFR gene mutations are difficult to grow up and passage in immunodeficient mice. Our data in this study also support this observation (Table?2). Clinical characteristics, such as patient clinical stage, pathological grade and gender showed no correlation with the success rates of the patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models. This is a similar observation to those of other investigators in this field [5,14,26,27]. However, patient tumors with late stage and higher tumor grade tended to be passaged further in mice [26]. On the other hand, univariate analysis showed that sex and smoking status both significantly affected the success rate of patient-derived xenograft model establishment, however multivariate analysis failed to show this correlation. This result implies that males and smokers are more prone to developing SCC, and consequently that female patients and non-smokers are more prone to developing AC. Furthermore, we observed that the quality of the tumor samples provided by surgeons was one of the most important factors for successful engraftment of patient-derived tumor xenograft models (unpublished ongoing studies). One of the most important advantages in developing patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models is that the model can better represent the genetic diversity and molecular characteristics of the original NSCLC patient tumor [22]. With regard to the carryover of genetic mutations from patient NSCLC tissues to mouse xenograft tissues, data from our study showed that genotypes are consistent between the original patient tumor and the corresponding xenograft tissue in all ten models for EGFR and KRAS status. In addition to mutations, our data also demonstrated that these patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models carry gene amplifications in 4/10 models, including FGFR1 and cMET, which are known anti-tumor drug targets [28-30]. Thus, these novel xenograft models represent useful tools for the preclinical study of emerging targeted therapies. Although the work of Judde et al. demonstrated a gefitinib anti-tumor response in a patient-derived NSCLC model (58% TGI) [31], genetic aberrations were not explored and characterized in detail across multiple models. In an effort to verify whether these novel models with different genetic aberrations exhibited a similar anti-tumor response to targeted therapy, we tested the efficacy of gefitinib in model L115, harboring an exon 19 deletion within EGFR. Gefitinib is an anti-EGFR agent shown to have clinical activity for the treatment of EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients [32]. In clinical studies, gefitinib induces initial tumor regressions in lung cancer patients with EGFR activating mutations, including Exon19 Del, L858R mutation, and has no significant anti-tumor activity in lung cancer patients with KRAS mutation [32]. Our data confirmed a very consistent response profile in the patient-derived NSCLC models. Model L115 responded completely to gefitinib treatment over 20?days of dosing (tumor disappeared), and displayed only very slow regrowth after 38?days post-dose cessation (Figure?3A). Two of the models with KRAS mutation were insensitive to gefitinib treatment. Interestingly, one KRAS mutation model, L030 showed little response to gefitinib (25% TGI), but the other, L1023 (KRAS mutation concurrent with cMET gene amplification) showed no response at all (0% TGI in L023 model). FGFR1 represents a promising new target in lung cancer therapy [28]. Here, we tested two of three FGFR1 gene amplified models derived from NSCLC patients with gefitinib. Compared to the EGFR activating mutation model, these two FGFR1 gene amplified models, L121 and L123 were relatively insensitive to gefitinib treatment (TGI=23%, and 47%, respectively). These models are likely \u00a1\u00aeoncogene addicted\u00a1\u00af to FGFR1 and indeed, potent tumor regressions have been previously observed in these 2 models using the selective small molecule inhibitor, AZD4547 [24]. A third FGFR1 amplified model, L133, failed to show a potent response to AZD4547 due to a lack of FGFR1 protein expression. Without question, these patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models harboring FGFR1 gene amplification have been extremely useful tools in testing the hypothesis that FGFR1 is a driving oncogene in NSCLC. In summary, ten patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models were established harboring a variety of genetic aberrations including; EGFR activating and KRAS mutations, and FGFR1 and cMET gene amplification. Within those models with EGFR and KRAS mutation, the anti-tumor efficacy of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib, was consistent with published preclinical data [33] and clinical responses [34-36]. Finally, these patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models represent useful tools to further understand this lethal disease and to enable development of personalized approaches for the treatment of NSCLC patients.

MET over-expression (with or without gene amplification), aberrant autocrine or paracrine ligand production, and missense MET mutations are mechanisms that lead to activation of the MET pathway in tumors and are associated with poor prognostic outcome. We report here preclinical development of a potent, orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor LY2801653 targeting MET kinase. LY2801653 is a type-II ATP competitive, slow-off inhibitor of MET tyrosine kinase with a dissociation constant (K i) of 2?nM, a pharmacodynamic residence time (K off) of 0.00132?min ?1 and t 1/2 of 525?min. LY2801653 demonstrated in vitro effects on MET pathway-dependent cell scattering and cell proliferation; in vivo anti-tumor effects in MET amplified (MKN45), MET autocrine (U-87MG, and KP4) and MET over-expressed (H441) xenograft models; and in vivo vessel normalization effects. LY2801653 also maintained potency against 13 MET variants, each bearing a single-point mutation. In subsequent nonclinical characterization, LY2801653 was found to have potent activity against several other receptor tyrosine oncokinases including MST1R, FLT3, AXL, MERTK, TEK, ROS1, DDR1/2 and against the serine/threonine kinases MKNK1/2. The potential value of MET and other inhibited targets within a number of malignancies (such as colon, bile ducts, and lung) is discussed. LY2801653 is currently in phase 1 clinical testing in patients with advanced cancer (trial I3O-MC-JSBA, NCT01285037). Electronic supplementary material. The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10637-012-9912-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. Introduction. The human MET proto-oncogene encodes the MET kinase, also known as HGF receptor. HGF binds with high affinity to this trans-membrane tyrosine kinase receptor and is the only known ligand for this receptor. Binding of HGF to the extracellular domain of MET induces receptor multimerization, activates the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor and results in the phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in the intracellular region. The HGF/MET signaling pathway regulates a wide variety of normal cellular functions that can be subverted to support neoplasia including cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, scattering and motility, invasion, and angiogenesis [1]. Dysregulated MET/HGF signaling leads to an abnormally activated cellular invasive program that plays a role in cellular transformation; epithelial-mesenchymsal transition; and tumor invasion, progression and metastasis. MET over-expression (with or without gene amplification), aberrant autocrine or paracrine ligand production, and missense MET mutations are mechanisms that lead to activation of the MET pathway in tumors and are associated with poor prognostic outcome [2]. Over-expression of MET, ligand-dependent activation, or MET amplification have also been implicated as potential mechanisms of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor therapies [3?6]. Receptor cross-activation of other oncoproteins such as MST1R (also known as RON), AXL and PDGFRA by MET has also been reported [7, 8]. We report the discovery and initial in vitro and in vivo evaluation of a small-molecule inhibitor LY2801653, whose development was initiated with the intent of targeting the MET kinase. We provide data to illustrate the in vitro effects of LY2801653 on the MET pathway-dependent cell scattering and cell proliferation, as well as its in vivo anti-tumor effects in mouse xenograft models. In subsequent nonclinical characterization, LY2801653 was screened against a larger panel of kinases and was found to have potent activity against several other receptor tyrosine oncokinases including MST1R (MET related tyrosine kinase), FLT3, AXL, MERTK, TEK, and ROS1, and against the serine/threonine kinases MKNK1/2. The potential value of MET and other inhibited targets within a number of malignancies is discussed. LY2801653 is currently in phase 1 clinical testing in patients with advanced cancer (trial I3O-MC-JSBA, NCT01285037). Materials and methods. Materials. The cell lines U-87MG, H441, H1299, MV4-11, HT29, H460, TT, Calu1, U118MG, A375, HCT-116, DU145, T47D and H1993 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). S114 cells were licensed from National Institute of Health; HCC78 and BaF3 cells were from DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany); MKN45 cells from the Japanese Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan); A2780 cells from NCI DCTD repository, and the KP4 cells from RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan); HUVECs were obtained from Invitrogen (Madison, WI). Cells were cultured according to manufacturers\u00a1\u00af guidelines. Chemical synthesis of LY2801653. The synthesis of LY2801653 is described in Example 1 of the patent [9]. MET inhibition enzyme kinetics studies. The dissociation constant (Ki) value, mode of inhibition (competitive, noncompetitive or uncompetitive) and the pharmacodynamic residence time (K off) value of LY2801653 for the MET kinase activity were determined using radiometric-filter binding and spin column assays. Methods for these assays are described in detail in the Supplementary Methods section. Co-crystallization of LY2801653 with MET and crystal structure determination. MET kinase domain (amino acid boundaries 1056?1364) was co-expressed with protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and purified by Kinasia (Carmel, IN) similarly to previous work by Wang et al. [10]. MET protein was purified by nickel affinity and MonoQ chromatography and concentrated to 8?mg/mL in 20?mM MES (pH 6.0), 500?mM NaCl, 10?% glycerol, and 2?mM DTT. The buffer was adjusted to 10?mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 500?mM NaCl, 5?% glycerol, 5?mM DTT, and 0.2?mM n-dodecyl-\u00a5\u00e2-D-maltoside for crystallization with 10?mg/mL MET incubated with 1?mM LY2801653 (1?% DMSO). Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20?\u00a1\u00c6C, with reservoir solution of 16?% PEG 10,000, 0.1?M HEPES (pH 7.0), 5?% ethylene glycol, and optimized by microseeding. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen with 20?% glycerol. Crystals of MET/LY2801653 belong to space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a=40.51?A, b=63.89?A, c=111.63?A. The diffraction data (1.8?A, 99.7?% complete) were collected and processed on SGX-CAT beam line at APS in Argonne National Laboratory. The crystal structure was determined by the method of molecular replacement using 1 internal MET structure as a search model. The Flynn program (OpenEye Scientific Software) was used for ligand fitting and Coot [11] was used in model building. Structure refinement (R work=0.216 and R free=0.249, RMS bond=0.009, RMS angle=1.218) was carried out by Refmac5 [12]. Protein Data Bank accession code for the co-crystal structure is 4EEV. Cell-based assays to determine the inhibition (IC 50) of MET auto-phosphorylation by LY2801653. Inhibition of auto-phosphorylation of MET by LY2801653 was assessed in two cell lines by ELISA. One measured the HGF stimulated MET auto-phosphorylation of Y1349 in H460 cells. Another measured the MET auto-phosphorylation at Y1230/Y1234/Y1235 in NIH3T3-derived S114 cells engineered to stably express human MET and HGF [13]. For details, see the Supplementary Method section. In vitro inhibitory activity of LY2801653 on MET-activating mutations. Translocated promoter region-MET (TPR-MET) oncogene [14] was cloned into the pLNCX2 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and various reported MET mutations in hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma were introduced using the QuikChange\u00a2\u00e2 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). BaF3 cells are an immortalized murine bone marrow?derived pro-B-cell line, the proliferation of which depends on the presence of IL3. These cells were transduced with retrovirus containing each of the TPR-MET mutation-bearing constructs as previously described [15]. BaF3 cell lines expressing these MET mutations were confirmed with bidirectional DNA sequencing, using 3730xl DNA analyzers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media+10?% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen # 26400-044) and antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen # 15240-067). 4.5\u00a1\u00bf10 3 cells (-IL3) or 1.8\u00a1\u00bf10 3 cells (+IL3) (10?ng/mL, R&D Systems, # 403-ml) were plated onto 96-well plates, treated with LY2801653, and incubated for 48?h at 37?\u00a1\u00c6C. WST1 reagent (Roche, #11644807001) was added and incubated for 2?h; absorbance was read at OD 450. The IC 50 values were determined with the JOCKYSS program. In vitro biochemical kinase specificity profiling of LY2801653. The specificity of the inhibitory activity of LY2801653 was determined using single-point or 3-point profiling and confirmatory 10-point or 11-point IC 50 assays available at EMD Millipore Inc. (Dundee, UK), Cerep (Poitiers, France), or KinomeScan (DiscoveRx, San Diego, CA). These assays used active full-length or receptor tyrosine kinase domain enzymes, and peptide or protein substrates unique to each enzyme. Reactions were run at or near the Km for ATP to allow for direct comparisons of IC 50 potency between the enzymes. For details, see the Supplementary Method section. In vitro HGF induced cell scattering assay. 2\u00a1\u00bf10 3 DU145 cells/well on poly-D-lysine 96-well black/clear plates were treated with LY2801653 (in 0.4?% DMSO), immediately followed by the addition of human HGF (20?ng/ml), and incubated for 48?h at 37?\u00a1\u00c6C. 2?% formaldehyde fixed cells were stained with AlexaFluor 488 Phalloidin (#A12379, Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) and counterstained with Propidium Iodide (# P3566 Invitrogen). Colony counts were quantified on Acumen Explorer\u00a2\u00e2 laser-scanning fluorescence microplate cytometer (TTP Labtech Ltd, Cambridge, MA). A colony was defined as\u00a1\u00c34 cells. Cell-based assays to determine the inhibition (IC 50) of non-MET kinases by LY2801653. Cell-based assays (anti-proliferative or inhibition of phosphorylation of target kinase) were performed to evaluate the inhibitory activity of LY2801653 against MST1R, AXL, ROS1, PDGFRA, MKNK1/2, FLT3, MERTK, TYRO3, TEK, KDR, CSF1R, RET, DDR1, DDR2. for details, see the Supplementary Method section. In vivo mouse studies. All animal studies were performed in accordance with American Association for Laboratory Animal Care institutional guidelines. All in vivo experimental protocols were approved by the Eli Lilly and Company Animal Care and Use Committee. Athymic nude mice and CD-1 nude mice were obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and Charles River (Wilmington, MA), respectively. In all in vivo studies, LY2801653 was formulated in 10?% acacia daily and dosed orally. The in vivo mouse studies explored the MET target inhibition and pharmacokinetics of LY2801653 in the S114 xenograft model; as well as the antitumor growth activity in xenograft (U-87MG, KP4, H441, MKN45, H1993, HT-29, and MV4-11) and in orthotopic (H1299) models. For details, see the Supplementary Method section. Multiplexed immunofluorescence tumor tissue imaging. U-87MG xenograft tumors were excised from mice after 28?days of dosing and placed into Zinc-Tris fixative (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), stained and quantified as previously described [16]. For the apoptotic and proliferative markers, slides were stained with a combination of Hoechst 33324 (Invitrogen), rat anti-mouse CD31 (Pharmingen) /anti-rat Alexa-488 (Invitrogen), rabbit anti-Ki67 (NeoMarkers)/anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (Invitrogen), and TUNEL-TMR red (Roche). For the angiogenesis markers, slides were stained with a combination of Hoechst 33324, rat anti-mouse CD31/anti-rat Alexa-488, rabbit anti-glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (Chemicon) /anti-rabbit Alexa 647, and mouse anti-Smooth Muscle Actin/Cy3 (Sigma). Results. LY2801653, structure shown in Fig.?1a, was designed to target the MET kinase. During the development, the kinase specificity profile of LY2801653 was evaluated against a panel of 100 kinases and LY2801653 was determined to be both a MET and MST1R inhibitor, with very weak activity against KDR. Later, LY2801653 was more broadly screened against a panel of over 400 kinases and the additional kinase activities identified are reported at the end of the Results section. In vitro MET inhibitory activities. LY2801653 was evaluated for its ability to inhibit biochemical and cellular functions of MET including cell scattering/migration and proliferation. Biochemical assays using purified human MET kinase domain and a synthetic peptide substrate demonstrated LY2801653 to be a potent, competitive, slow-off inhibitor of MET tyrosine kinase (Supplementary Fig. S1) with a dissociation constant (K i) of 2?nM, a pharmacodynamic residence time (K off) of 0.00132?min ?1 and a half-life (t 1/2) of 525?min. The crystal structure of MET bound to LY2801653 was determined to 1.8?A (Fig.?1b) and demonstrated that the inhibitor bound MET is in an inactive form with the activation loop DFG motif adopting a DFG-out conformation indicating that LY2801653 is a type II kinase inhibitor [17, 18]. The mean IC 50 value (n=6 determinations) of LY2801653 for inhibition of MET auto-phosphorylation in HGF-stimulated H460 cells was 35.2\u00a1\u00be6.9?nM and the IC 50 for MET auto-phosphorylation in S114 cells was 59.2?nM. The activity of LY2801653 was also evaluated in BaF3 cells stably expressing 1 of 13 different MET-activating mutations (Table?1). Transfection with the MET variants conferred growth-factor independence and treatment with LY2801653 inhibited growth of these MET variant clones with an IC 50 ranging from 3-fold more potent (V1092I) to approximately 6-fold less potent (L1195V) compared with the growth inhibition of cells with the MET wild-type sequence. In vitro, LY2801653 potently blocked HGF-induced DU-145 cell scattering (Fig.?2). Among the untreated controls, approximately 300 colonies were detected. With HGF treatment scattering was induced, and the number of colonies detected was reduced to approximately 90. LY2801653, in the concentration range of 0.01?10?\u00a5\u00ecM, completely blocked the HGF-induced scattering. Anti-proliferative effect of LY2801653 was evaluated against a panel of MET expressing cell lines (Supplementary Table S1). LY2801653 demonstrated more potent anti-proliferative activity in cell lines with MET gene amplification (MKN45, Hs746T and H1993) than the cell lines without MET gene amplification (U-87MG, KATO-III). In vivo MET target inhibition study in S114 xenograft model. Target inhibition studies to assess activity of LY2801653 were undertaken in S114 xenograft tumors created through subcutaneous implantation of S114 cells, a murine cell line engineered to express both human MET and HGF [13]. MET phosphorylation was inhibited by 98?% 2?h post-treatment with a single 50-mg/kg dose. Dose response studies were then performed at this same time point to further assess potency. LY2801653 treatment inhibited MET phosphorylation with a composite TED50 (50?% target inhibition dose) of 1.2?mg/kg and a composite TED90 (90?% target inhibition dose) of 7.4?mg/kg (Fig.?3a). The corresponding TEC50 (the concentration that inhibited 50?% MET phosphorylation) was 0.2 \u00a5\u00ecM, whereas the TEC90 (the concentration that inhibited 90?% MET phosphorylation) was 2?\u00a5\u00ecM (Fig.?3b). A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship was observed in these studies. Subsequently, a dose of 12?mg/kg (TED95) was used in a 24-h time course study to examine the duration of action. Ninety-five percent inhibition of p-MET occurred at 2?h and was maintained up to 8?h (data not shown). By 16?h, no p-MET inhibition was observed in tumors. Among the species studied, LY2801653 has the shortest elimination half life in mice of 2.9?h, compared with 14.3?h in non-human primate (data not shown). Anti-tumor activity in MET-dependent mouse xenograft models. MET amplification status by FISH analysis of U-87MG, H441, and MKN45 cells is shown in Fig.?4a. U-87MG and KP4 cells (Fig.?4b and c, respectively) were selected for representation of MET pathway activation via autocrine signaling. Two additional lines were selected to explore ligand-independent MET over-expression either in the presence (MKN45 cells; Fig.?4d) or low MET gene amplification (H441 cells; Fig.?4e). Whereas neither MKN45 nor H441 cells express detectable HGF, both U-87MG and KP4 cells express HGF with the highest levels being found in the latter (KP4: 4.7?ng/10 6 cells/24?h; U-87MG: 0.13?ng/10 6 cells/24?h). At doses of 4 and 12?mg/kg, similar levels of anti-tumor growth activity were observed with once or twice daily dosing of LY2801653 for the U-87MG, and H441 xenograft models. Two non-continuous dosing regimens were also explored in the U-87MG and H441 xenograft models. The U-87MG study (Fig.?4b-2) evaluated the 9/5 schedule for 2?cycles and the 5/2 schedule for 4?cycles. The H441 study (Fig.?4e) evaluated the 9/5 schedule for 3?cycles and the 5/2 schedule for 6?cycles. Results indicated that when dosed at 12?mg/kg (around TED95), the anti-tumor growth effect in the two non-continuous dosing regimens was similar to that in the twice-daily uninterrupted dosing groups. The tumor growth delay lasted for at least a week after discontinuing dosing. When the dose was lowered to 3?mg/kg, the 9/5 schedule displayed better anti-tumor growth effect than the 5/2 schedule in U-87MG xenograft tumor models (Fig.?4b-2). Vessel normalization and anti-apoptotic/anti-proliferative effect. Multiplexed tissue imaging was performed on U-87MG xenograft tumors treated with vehicle (Figs.?5a?c) or LY2801653 treatment of 1.3?mg/kg (Figs.?5d?f) and 12?mg/kg (Figs.?5g?i). Qualitatively, U-87MG xenografts from vehicle-treated animals were well vascularized, with focalized areas of hypoxia and necrosis. Tumors had a tortuous network of vessels consisting of extensive neo-angiogenic vascular sprouts and mature vessels (CD31-labeled cells) that were poorly covered by pericytes and most vehicle-treated tumors had clearly demarcated hypoxic areas (marked by GLUT1 staining) located some distance from perfused vessels as well as necrotic areas spaced more distal from vessels. Low-dose (1.3?mg/kg once daily\u00a1\u00bf28?days) LY2801653 did not result in qualitative differences in any angiogenesis parameters, but did lead to a quantitative increase in vessel area (Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast, treatment once daily with 12?mg/kg LY2801653 appeared to modulate angiogenesis as evident by a decrease in GLUT1 expression, an increase in pericyte coverage of vessels, and a qualitative difference in vessel phenotype. Specifically, vessels in tumors from the 12?mg/kg group, when compared with vehicle-treated tumors, were of smaller caliber, less tortuous, highly pericyte-covered, and lacked staining for hypoxia (GLUT-1) in surrounding tumor cells (Fig.?5, Supplementary Fig. S2) suggesting adequate regional perfusion. Vehicle-treated tumors had proliferating tumor cells in close proximity to the vasculature, but also frequently displayed one or more large areas of necrosis that were avascular. Treatment with 1.3?mg/kg LY2801653 showed a trend of reducing the area of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2), while treatment with 12?mg/kg LY2801653 significantly reduced apoptotic area. Focalized areas of necrosis/apoptosis were absent in this treatment group, and tumor cells were less densely packed and had lower intensity of Hoechst staining (mean nuclear intensity), which was consistent with a decreased proliferative potential. Kinase specificity profile for LY2801653. These in vitro studies demonstrated that, in addition to being a MET inhibitor, LY2801653 also has potent activity against MST1R, the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (AXL, MERTK, and TYRO3), ROS1, PDGFRA, FLT3, TEK, DDR1/2 and MKNK1/2 (Table?2). A dendrogram of the in vitro cell-based activity of LY2801653 with IC 50 less than 200?nM is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. Findings from subsequent testing of LY2801653 in xenograft or orthotopic models selected based on their dependence on MST1R (H1993, HT-29), FLT3 (MV4-11), and AXL (H1299) were consistent with the anti-growth activity of LY2801653 in the presence of these targets (Figs.?4f, and g and Supplementary Figs. S4A-C). NSCLC-derived H1993 xenograft tumors have previously been shown to have high levels of pMST1R due to transactivation by highly amplified MET [7]. The HT-29 colon xenograft tumors not only express MET, but also express a constitutively activated splice variant of MST1R, p160MST1R [19]. Growth of MV4-11 xenograft tumors, an acute myeloid leukemia cell line is driven by a FLT3-activating mutation [20], and in vitro anti-proliferative activity of LY2801653 for MV4-11 cells was determined to have an IC 50 of 4?nM. Lastly, the NSCLC H1299 xenograft tumors over-express AXL and its ligand Gas6. Discussion. MET inhibitory activity. The normal physiologic regulation of HGF and MET signaling found in development and organogenesis is prone to dysregulation in cancer and may contribute to invasion and metastasis [1, 18]. For these reasons, LY2801653 was developed through a strategy of targeting the MET receptor, and data presented here demonstrate that LY2801653 is a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase, which is further capable of inhibiting MET-dependent tumor cell proliferation and migration/scattering. In addition, LY2801653 was able to induce vessel normalization in xenograft tumors. Whereas MET signaling is involved in angiogenesis, this latter effect of LY2801653 may not be exclusively due to MET inhibition. Indeed, inhibition of angiogenesis by LY2801653 may include contributions from among the limited range of other targets that it inhibits, such as TEK and AXL, that are involved in modulating angiogenesis. In vitro biochemical measurements showed LY2801653 to be a potent inhibitor of MET with a 2?nM K i, this activity was confirmed in cell-based assessments, in which LY2801653 had an IC 50 for inhibition of MET phosphorylation of 35.2?59.2?nM. The S114 cell line is an engineered mouse cell line expressing both human MET and HGF. In mice implanted subcutaneously with S114 tumorigenic cells, LY2801653 given orally at 12?mg/kg resulted in 95?% inhibition of MET phosphorylation in the tumors for up to 8?h. With elimination t 1/2 being the shortest in mice of 2.9?h (e.g. compared to 14.3?h in non-primate), but with the kinase active site occupancy t 1/2 of approximately 8.5?h, LY2801653 can be dosed orally twice a day in mouse tumor model studies. The crystal structure of MET bound with LY2801653 indicates that LY2801653 is a type II inhibitor and illustrates that the mechanism of inhibition is through the stabilization of the inactive \u00a1\u00aeDFG-out\u00a1\u00af conformation [17, 18]. This binding mode often leads to a long dissociation time constant, a feature that was experimentally confirmed by the observation that LY2801653 has a slow-off rate with an active site occupancy t 1/2 of approximately 8.5?h. Type-II kinase inhibitors are typically more tolerant of mutations in the kinase domain than type-I inhibitors [17]. For LY2801653, this feature was experimentally confirmed, and the molecule does retain inhibitory activity with a variety of MET-activating point mutations. Of the 13 point mutations examined, 12 are within the kinase domain. The exception, S1040P, is in the juxtamembrane domain. The MET crystal structure with bound LY2801653 provides a basis to interpret the impact of these mutations on the IC 50 of LY2801653. The 2 mutants causing the greatest increases in IC 50 (L1195V and M1131T) are located at the hydrophobic binding site of the inhibitor where changing from a hydrophobic side chain to a polar one, or reducing the size of hydrophobic side chain, is expected to weaken the inhibitor binding. The 2 mutants (D1228N, M1250T) with the next largest increases in IC 50 bear mutations in the activation loop. This region is distal from the inhibitor. One of the mutations (D1228N) was not observed in the structure due to loop disorder. Thus the impact of the mutation is not through direct interaction with the inhibitor. One hypothesis for the increased IC 50 is that these activating mutations stabilize the active conformation of the activation loop (DFG-in conformation), therefore reducing the potency of the inhibitor. The 2 mutations with noticeable decreases in IC 50 (V1092I, V1220I) are located near the inhibitor. Both mutations slightly increase the bulk of the hydrophobic side chain, likely leading to stronger Van der Waals and/or hydrophobic interactions with the inhibitor. Activating mutations of MET have been reported in sporadic and inherited papillary renal carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and other neoplasms [21]. The majority of these mutations are kinase domain mutations with homology to cancer-inducing mutations in other receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR. In HNSCC, cells harboring multiple kinase domain mutations have been observed and are postulated to be selected during metastatic spread [22]. The 13 MET mutations evaluated here represent approximately half of the kinase domain mutations currently reported in the literature [23]. The LY2801653-binding configuration to MET appears to contribute 2 clinically intriguing features; specifically, the potential ability to retain potency versus a spectrum of mutations and the ability to sustain target inhibition due to its slow off-rate. Because the HGF/MET pathway has also been shown to be involved in cancer cell survival and growth, LY2801653 was evaluated for its ability to inhibit cell growth against a panel of MET expressing tumor cell lines. LY2801653 showed several-fold more potent anti-proliferative activity against tumor cell lines with high MET gene amplification (MKN45, Hs746T, H1993) than the cell lines without MET amplification (U-87MG, KATO III). These potency differences were less evident in the in vivo evaluation in xenograft models. The in vivo effects in xenograft mouse models observed for LY2801653 were otherwise consistent with the in vitro data. LY2801653 treatment demonstrated significant anti-tumor growth effect in two MET autocrine models (U-87MG, KP4), a model with very high MET gene amplification (MKN45), and a model with MET low MET amplification, but over-expression, (H441). Similar tumor growth inhibition effect was observed following LY2801653 dosing of 4 to 12?mg/kg either once or twice a day. In the U-87MG and H441 models, similar anti-tumor effects were seen with interrupted dosing on a 9/5 or 5/2 schedule. Whereas the mechanism for maintaining tumor growth suppression with the non-continuous dosing schedules is unclear, it may be related to the observed slow off-rate of LY2801653 released from the ATP-binding site of the kinase target. Kinase selectivity profile. Whereas type-II inhibitors are often characterized by a broad spectrum of kinase activity, LY2801653 retains a limited repertoire of engagement. The selectivity profile was examined through biochemical screening against 442 kinases, followed by confirmation with cell-based activity assays. LY2801653 was found to have potent activity against 11 additional kinases besides MET. A dendrogram shows that the 11 kinases are clustered in 3 regions, 2 of them in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs) families and 1 (MKNK1/2) in the CAMK family (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases). Because LY2801653 does not have significant activity against ALK and LTK, it is somewhat surprising to find potent activity against ROS1, which is in the member of the ALK/LTK family. The x-ray crystal structure data may offer some insight. The inactive form of the ALK structure has been shown to be distinct from the typical features, such as the DFG-out conformation, observed in other RTKs [24]. Instead, it appears that the DFG-in conformation is more stable in the inactive form of ALK, explaining the lack of inhibition by LY2801653. As MKNK1/2 are inhibited by LY2801653 despite these being serine/threonine kinases rather than tyrosine kinases, this inhibition is likely due to the inactive form of MKNK1/2 adopting a DFG-out (DFD in MKNK1/2) conformation, stabilized in part by the replacement of Asp (D) for Gly (G) in the canonical DFG motif [25, 26]. LY2801653 is an inhibitor of MET and MST1R (Table?2) in vitro and demonstrates tumor activity in 2 xenograft models (H1993, HT29) that co-express MET and MST1R. Tumor cells such as H1993 that have high levels of MET gene amplification have been shown to cross-activate MST1R [7]. The ability to potently block both MET and MST1R pathway signaling may be advantageous in treating tumors with this phenotype. Some of the other kinase targets of LY2801653 presented in Table?2 were also examined further in in vivo models. The potent in vitro anti-proliferative activity (IC 50=4?nM) and in vivo anti-tumor growth activity of LY2801653 with the MV4-11 tumor cells may be explained by its inhibitory activity against FLT3 as this tumor cell line bears a FLT3-activating mutation [20]. The in vivo anti-tumor growth activity of LY2801653 against AXL was demonstrated in a murine orthotopic model of NSCLC (H1299) with AXL over-expression. MET has been reported to be capable of transactivating AXL and PDGFRA in vitro in tumor cells [8]. In human bladder cancer, co-expression of these RTKs was associated with poor patient survival, and over-expression of MET/AXL/PDGFRA was shown to correlate with poor survival, and contributed to the progression of human bladder cancer [8]. Up-regulation of AXL was reported recently to be a resistance mechanism to EGFR targeted therapy [27]. MKNK1/2 are activated by ERK or p38 [28], leading to the phosphorylation of several substrates including eIF4E and Sprouty2, thereby enhancing tumorigenesis [29]. An increase in Sprouty-2 protein in tumor cells was associated with an increase in MET expression and in tumor malignancy, especially in colon cancer cells [28]. LY2801653 treatment produces anti-tumor effect in multiple murine xenograft models bearing KRAS-activating mutation as illustrated in H441 NSCLC cells and KP4 pancreatic cells, and treatment outcomes for such tumors may benefit from combined MET and MKNK1/2 inhibition. ROS1 is an orphan RTK that has been reported to be constitutively activated via gene translocation leading to formation of fusion proteins in glioblastoma, NSCLC, ovarian cancer and cholangiocarcinoma [30?33]. Over-expression of DDR1/2 has been reported in multiple tumor types such as sarcoma [34]. Activating mutations for DDR2 in squamous cell lung cancer were also reported [34, 35]. In view of the reported transforming activity of constitutively activated ROS1 kinase with various fusion partners, and the potent inhibitory activity of LY2801653 for ROS1 and DDR1/2, there may be clinical merit in evaluating LY2801653 in tumor types bearing ROS1 or DDR1/2 aberrations. Tumor vessel normalization describes a process whereby a tortuous, poorly perfused vascular network is converted to one that consists of directionally-aligned, highly perfused, pericyte-covered vessels [36]. Treatment of U-87MG tumor-bearing mice with daily doses of 12?mg/kg LY2801653 resulted in phenotypic events that are hallmarks of vessel normalization. Whereas the tumors treated with 12?mg/kg LY2801653 displayed a more functional vasculature, the tumors themselves had less apoptotic and proliferative markers compared with vehicle-treated tumors, consistent with a cytostatic phenotype. As LY2801653 has little or no inhibitory activity against KDR, the displayed anti-angiogenic effects in vivo were most probably via a non-VEGFR-dependent mechanism. The HGF/MET [37], the AXL and MERTK [38], and the TEK [39] pathways were all reported to play a role in tumor angiogenesis and were inhibited by LY2801653. In summary, we report here a potent type II ATP-competitive inhibitor of MET, LY2801653, that has in vivo anti-tumor activities in multiple mouse xenograft models, as well as anti-angiogenic, and anti-proliferative/cytostatic activities. In addition, this -molecule has potent inhibitory activity against several other oncogenic proteins, including MST1R, FLT3, AXL, PDGFRA, ROS1, TEK, DDR1/2 and MKNK-1/2. Nonclinical testing suggests that LY2801653 may have merits for clinical evaluation in tumors with a number of MET pathway phenotypic profiles such as over-expression, activating mutation, and gene amplification. Furthermore, as MKNK-1/2 is down-stream of the RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, LY2801653 may have anti-tumor activity in tumors bearing KRAS-activating mutations in addition to the over-expression of the above mentioned RTK targets. These observations have supported the progression of LY2801653 into clinical testing in an ongoing phase 1 study (JSBA, NCT01285037). Electronic supplementary material.

It has been shown that the SONIC HEDGEHOG (SHH)-GLI and MAPK signaling pathway regulate cell growth in many tumors including melanoma and interact with each other in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. Here we show that the SHH-GLI pathway is active in human melanoma cell lines as they express downstream target of this pathway GLI1. Expression of GLI1 was significantly higher in human primary melanoma tissues harboring BRAF V600E mutation than those with wild type BRAF. Pharmacologic inhibition of BRAF V600E in human melanoma cell lines resulted in decreased expression of GLI1 thus demonstrating interaction of SHH-GLI and MAPK pathways. Inhibition of SHH-GLI pathway by the novel small molecule inhibitor of smoothened NVP-LDE225 was followed by inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in human melanoma cell lines, interestingly with both BRAF V600E and BRAF Wild Type status. NVP-LDE225 was potent in reducing cell proliferation and inducing tumor growth arrest in vitro and in vivo, respectively and these effects were superior to the natural compound cyclopamine. Finally, we conclude that inhibition of SHH-GLI signaling pathway in human melanoma by the specific smoothened inhibitor NVP-LDE225 could have potential therapeutic application in human melanoma even in the absence of BRAF V600E mutation and warrants further investigations. Introduction. Human melanoma is the most malignant skin cancer [1]. The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing in general population and is the most common skin cancer in females aged 25?29 [2]. So far there are no effective therapies after metastasis. Human melanoma is a heterogeneous cancer. Depending on body site and extent of sun exposure it is characterized by different genetic alterations [3]. Frequent mutations in signaling pathways responsible for growth and proliferation of melanoma have been discovered [4]. Among these pathways the MAPK-cascade seems to be the most important one [5]. Activating mutations in two of MAPK upstream regulators, BRAF and NRAS is seen in up to 80% of melanomas and also correlates with melanoma aggressiveness and poor prognosis [6], [7], [8]. These molecules or their downstream kinases (among others MEK 1/2) are potential therapeutic targets for human melanoma. Recent discoveries in this field has resulted in the development of multiple drugs, among them vemurafenib (PLX-4032) a small molecule inhibitor targeting mutated BRAF V600E (a mutation seen in 60% of human melanomas). A pilot clinical study by Fleherty K. et al. [9] showed an 81% response rate in stage IV melanoma patients refractory to conventional chemo/immunotherapies. Interestingly, in a recent phase 3 randomized trial comparing vemurafenib with dacarbazine, vemurafenib yielded improved rates of overall and progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation and was superior to dacarbazine [10]. Several clinical trials are testing the effectiveness of MEK 1/2 inhibitors in melanoma patients (www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=MEKmelanoma). A pilot study presented by S. P. Patel at the 2010 ASCO meeting in Chicago showed a trend toward response and clinical benefit in the patients treated with MEK 1/2 inhibitor and harboring a BRAF V600E gene mutation [11]. High incidence of relapse in these patients after an initial phase of clinical response argues for development of possible new mutations or skewing of the BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway into a BRAF-independent NRAS-PI3K-AKT-mTOR or c-RAF-MEK-ERK pathways [12], [13], [14], [15]. Therefore, identification of new targets for possible combination therapy is inevitable. HEDGEHOG (Hh) is a polypeptide, intercellular signaling molecule. It was initially discovered in drosophila and is known to play crucial role as segment polarity gene [16]. Hedgehog signaling also plays an important role in fly embryogenesis [17] and other developmental processes [18]. Three hedgehog homologues have been reported in mammals: SONIC-Hh, INDIAN-Hh and DESERT-Hh, with SONIC-Hh being most extensively studied [19]. Although Hh signaling is imperative to the normal human development and other vital processes [20], aberrant Hh signaling has been shown to cause developmental defects and promote tumorigenesis [21], [22]. PATCHED, a 12 transmembrane protein is the receptor for Hh, which in its active, unbound state binds and inhibits SMOOTHENED (Smo), another seven-transmembrane protein. SMOOTHENED is a positive regulator for the activation of GLIoma-associated (GLI) family of Zinc finger transcription factors activation and their subsequent nuclear translocation [23], [24]. GLI transcription factor family comprises of three members: GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3. GLI1 and GLI2 are transcription activators whereas GLI3 has been suggested to function as a transcription repressor [25]. GLI, PTCH1, NOTCH, WNT, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin like growth factor, fibroblast growth factor have been shown as some of the Hh target genes, regulated by transcriptional activity of GLI [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. Activating mutations in the components of Hedgehog signaling or elevated Hh levels enhance the signaling output of this pathway in several cancers. Mutations in different signaling molecules within Hh-signaling pathway have been identified in sporadic medulloblastoma [31], [32], while inactivating PTCH1 mutations have been associated with Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome [33]. Patients suffering from Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome develop basal cell carcinomas and carry much higher risk of developing medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations have been attributed to most of the sporadic BCC whereas SMO mutations account for approximately 10% of the cases [34], [35]. Although mutations in the Hh signaling pathway could account for pathology of some of the cancers, there has been constant increase in the belief that enhanced Hh levels in the tumor-microenvironment could also play a pathogenetic role in promoting several other types of cancers. Elevated Hh levels and enhanced expression of Hh target genes has been detected in diverse cancer types, such as pancreatic cancer, small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, upper gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer [22]. Until recently the involvement of Hh signaling in melanomas was unknown and unexpected due to the lack of genetic perturbations or enhanced expression of the Hh signaling components [36]. Recently the hedgehog signaling requirement has been shown in melanoma cell lines and in genetically induced melanoma mouse model [37]. In this study, authors show that hyperactivated Mek-Erk and Akt signaling could enhance transcriptional activity of GLI [37]. The SHH-GLI and MAPK signaling pathways also regulate growth in many tumors, suggesting cooperation between these two pathways in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival [38], [39], [40]. In line with the importance of hedgehog signaling in tumor biology, a range of drugs have been developed in the last years to block this signaling pathway. Cyclopamine and Jervine, derived from corn lilies are among the initial compounds discovered with potent inhibitory activity against SMOOTHENED [41], [42]. High-throughput screening of small molecule libraries has led to the identification of several additional SMO inhibitors including HhAntag [43], SANTs1-4 [44], Cur-61414 [45] and NVP-LDE225 [46]. In this study, using quantitative real-time PCR and cDNA microarray analysis, we show that the GLI1 is expressed in human melanoma cell lines and its expression is significantly higher in primary human melanoma tissues harboring BRAF V600E mutation as compared to those with wild type BRAF. Inhibition of BRAF V600E using specific inhibitor PLX-4032 resulted in significant reduction in the expression of both GLI1 and phospho-ERK 1/2 at protein level. We demonstrate that both standard SHH-GLI inhibitor cyclopamine and the novel more specific inhibitor of smoothened NVP-LDE225 reduce the GLI1 promoter activity, induce G1 cell cycle arrest, and induce apoptosis in human melanoma cell lines. Finally, the in vivo antitumor activity of NVP-LDE225 in human melanoma xenotransplantation model was potent and significantly higher than cyclopamine. Materials and Methods. Mice. 6?10 weeks old athymic Nude-Foxn1 nu/nu mice (Harlan Winkelmann, Borchen, Germany) were used in the experiments. All experiments were done with approval and following the guidelines of the Animal Research Committee of the Medical University of Vienna and the Austrian Ministry of Science and Research. Cell lines, tissues and reagents. Normal Human Epidermal Melanocytes (NHEM) were obtained from Promo-Cell (Heidelberg, Germany) and cultured in Melanocyte Growth Medium M2 (Promo-Cell). Human melanoma cell line MALME 3M, SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-3, SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-28, HT-144 and MEWO were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). UACC-62, 257, M14 cell lines were from DCTD Tumor Repository (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). WM 35, WM 115, WM 165-1, WM 266-2, WM 278, WM 983A, WM 983B, WM 983C cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). These cell lines have been published before and characterized by genomic and immunology approaches [47], [48]. MEL FH was a gift from Professor Nick Hayward (Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Australia) [7], [49]. On receipt, the authenticity of cell lines was verified using cytology and flow cytometry, throughout the culture by assessment of typical morphology by the investigators and, whenever indicated, by sequencing for the presence of gene mutations. Mutational status in several relevant oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes is demonstrated in Table S1. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640, supplemented with 2.5% heat-inactivated FCS (Fetal Calf Serum) and 2 mM L-glutamine (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and hereafter referred to as culture medium. After seeding from cryopreserved stock, cells were passaged at least 2?3 times before experiments. NVP-LDE225 was provided by Novartis Austria and cyclopamine was from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Propidium iodide (PI, Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria), Annexin V (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide) and thymidine (both from Sigma-Aldrich) were used in this study. RNA isolation, gene expression profiling and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. Total RNA was isolated from monolayer cell cultures and cryopreserved tissues using TriReagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tissue sampling and gene expression profiling was done by using Affeymetrix U133A microarray platform as previously described [50]. Microarray experiments were conducted according to standard protocols for Affymetrix Genome U133A arrays (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 1 \u00a5\u00ecg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA and biotinylated cRNA using the GeneChip expression 3\u00a1\u00c7 amplification reagent kits of Affymetrix. cRNA hybridization and scanning of the array were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. Gene set and pathway enrichment analysis has been performed as previously described [50]. The data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GEO [51] and are accessible through GEO Series accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE8401\",\"term_id\":\"8401\"}}GSE8401. For RT-PCR study reverse transcription was done by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase using random hexamer and oligo-dT primers (all from Invitrogen). GLI1, \u00a5\u00e2-actin cDNAs or 18S rRNA were amplified using primer/probe sets # Hs01110770_g1, # Hs99999903-m1 and # Hs99999901-s1, respectively from Applied Biosystems. Reactions were performed in an AbiPrism 7700 DNA amplifier under following conditions: initial heating at 50\u00a1\u00c6C for 2 min and 95\u00a1\u00c6C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles consisting of a denaturation step (90\u00a1\u00c6C, 15 s) and an annealing/elongation step (60\u00a1\u00c6C, 1 min). Each sample was assayed in duplicate. Negative controls represented full PCR reaction mixtures with cDNA substituted by ddH 2O. The read-out for each reaction was cycle of threshold (Ct), i.e. the cycle number where the fluorescent signal became higher than a pre-defined threshold. In all experiments, levels of GLI1 mRNA were expressed semi-quantitatively using the \u00a5\u00c4\u00a5\u00c4Ct method and 18S rRNA as a reference gene, according to the formula: pGL3b-hPTCH1-prom-wt and pGL3b-hPTCH1-prom-mut Promoter Reporter Construct. Specially designed reporter constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Fritz Aberger (Department of Molecular Biology, University of Salzburg, AT). Plasmids were constructed on the basis of pGL3-basic vectors (Promega, Madison, WI) with a firefly luciferase reporter gene. The wild type PTCH1 (PTCH1-wt) reporter plasmid was constructed with the human wild type PTCH1 promoter with two functional GLI binding sites (5\u00a1\u00c7-GACCTCCCA-3\u00a1\u00c7 and 5\u00a1\u00c7-GACCACCCA-3\u00a1\u00c7, see Figure S1). This was shown to be a consensus target sequence for all three GLI transcription factors (TFs) [52]. A control reporter construct (PTCH-mut) was generated by introduction of a CC>GG substitution (GACCTCCCA>GACCTGGCA and GACCACCCA>GACCAGGCA). This mutation prevented binding of GLI TFs to the promoter sequence (personal correspondence with Dr. Fritz Aberger, 2009/04/11). Subclones were verified by DNA sequencing (VBC-Genomics, Vienna, Austria). Transfection efficacy was determined by co-transfection of a pRL-TK promoter reporter construct (Promega). The plasmid contains the Renilla luciferase reporter gene under the control of a HSV-TK (herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase) promoter, which provides constitutive expression in mammalian cells [53], [54]. Dual Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay. Luciferase activity was measured after transient transfection of the pGL3-basic vector (determination of background luciferase activity), the pGL3b-hPTCH1-prom-wt and pGL3b-hPTCH1-prom-mut. Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection with a pB-actin-RL reporter containing a full-length renilla luciferase gene under the control of a human \u00a5\u00e2-actin promoter. For transfection experiments, 2\u00a1\u00bf10 5 cells were cultured overnight in 48 well tissue culture plates. Luciferase reporter plasmids were added together with Lipofectamine\u00a2\u00e2 2000 according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). All experiments were performed in triplicates. Measurement of luciferase expression was done according to manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Immunofluorescent microscopy. The immunofluorescent microscopy was performed as previously described [47]. Cell cycle analysis, Annexin V and MTT assays. Cell cycle analysis was performed as elsewhere described [55]. Briefly, on specific time points cells were collected, resuspended in PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline, Invitrogen), ice-cold 70% ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) added dropwise while mildly vortexing. After removing ethanol, cells were washed with 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS and then resuspended in DNA staining buffer [(PBS/PI 10 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml/RNase A 250 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich)]. After 15 min incubation at 37\u00a1\u00c6C PI signal was acquired in FL-2 or FL-3 channel of a flow cytometer using a linear scale (FACScan, BD Biosciences, Vienna, Austria). Hypodiploid (necrotic/apoptotic), diploid (G1/G0) and tetraploid (G2/M) cells were quantified using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For annexin V-based apoptosis detection assay, human melanoma cell lines were collected at desired time points post drug treatment. After washing in PBS (Invitrogen) cells were resuspended in 1\u00a1\u00bfBinding buffer (BD Biosciences), annexin V-FITC (BD Biosciences) and PI were added according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). After 15 min incubation at room temperature, cells were acquired by flow cytometry. All, early apoptotic cells (annexin V positive, PI negative) and necrotic/late apoptotic cells (annexin V positive, PI positive) as well as living cells (double negative) were detected by FACScan and subsequently analyzed by CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Standard MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was performed in 96-well plates as described previously [56]. The viability was measured using following formula: Western blot analysis. Antibodies were rabbit anti-human GLI1 (100-401-223, Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA), Phospho-p44/42 Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204, E10) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and \u00a5\u00e1-tubulin (DM1A) (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). For western blotting, equal amounts of protein, as determined by the BCA protein micro assay (BioRAD, Hercules, CA), were resolved by sodium-dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Primary antibody staining was done at 4\u00a1\u00c6C over night. Visualization was done using the ECL Detection System (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Tumor xenografts. 1\u00a1\u00bf10 6 tumor cells were inoculated subcutaneously into 6- to 10-week-old nu/nu athymic female mice into both flanks in 100 \u00a5\u00ecl of PBS containing 10% FCS. Tumors with the mean volume of 48+/?4 mm 3 were injected with vehicle (PEG 300/10% EtOH), cyclopamine or NVP-LDE225 on daily basis. Tumour growth was monitored every 2?3 days and the volume calculated (\u00a5\u00f0/6\u00a1\u00bf(larger diameter\u00a1\u00bf(smaller diameter) 2). Mice were observed daily for survival and body weight measured. Experiments were terminated when tumors reached volumes >1500 mm3 or animals showed signs of distress due to tumor growth. All experiments were done with approval and following the guidelines of the Animal Research Committee of the Medical University of Vienna and the Austrian Ministry of Science and Research. Statistics. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad-Instat\u00a2\u00e2 software (www.graphpad.com). GLI1 expression in tissues was analyzed by ANOVA test with Tukey's post-test. Growth of human tumor xenografts and human primary melanoma transcript levels were analyzed using two-sided Welch's t-test. Results. GLI1 expression is significantly higher in human primary melanomas harboring BRAF V600E mutation as compared to BRAF Wild Type. We performed quantitative RT-PCR to analyze the expression of the GLI1 as a surrogate marker of Hedgehog signaling pathway activity in human melanoma cell lines. The expression of GLI1 in majority of human melanoma cell lines including the ones from NCI-60 panel of human cancer cell lines (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/docs/misc/common_files/cell_list.html) could be detected as in the case of the normal human melanocytes (Fig. 1 A). Gene expression analysis was performed on our previously generated cDNA microarray (The data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GEO [51] and are accessible through GEO Series accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE8401\",\"term_id\":\"8401\"}}GSE8401), including primary melanoma tissues either being wild type for BRAF (n=7) or harboring BRAF V600E (n=15) mutation using Affymetrix U133A Oligonucleotide Microarray platform. The expression of GLI1 was significantly higher in tissue samples with BRAF V600E mutation as compared to the wild type ones (Fig. 1 B). BRAF V600E inhibitor PLX-4032 reduces GLI1 protein expression in human melanoma cells. Human melanoma cell lines LOX IMVI and UACC 257 harboring BRAF V600E mutation were treated with PLX-4032 and subsequently subjected to WB analysis for the expression of GLI1 and phospho-ERK 1/2 (as a marker for MAPK inhibition). The GLI1 expression was significantly reduced upon MAPK inhibition as was the expression of phospho-ERK 1/2 (Fig. 2A). NVP-LDE225 inhibits Hedgehog-GLI pathway in human melanoma cells in vitro. In order to study the effect of NVP-LDE225 [46] on the activity of the Hedgehog signaling pathway Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay was used. LOX IMVI human melanoma cells were transfected with either pGL3b-hPTCH1-prom-wt (Patched promoter containing 2 wild type GLI1 binding sites) or pGL3b-hPTCH1-prom-mut (Patched promoter containing 2 mutated GLI1 binding sites) and both containing the luciferase reporter sequence. In contrast to pGL3b-hPTCH1-prom-mut transfected, the pGL3b-hPTCH1-prom-wt LOX IMVI cells showed a significant decrease in luciferase activity after treatment with NVP-LDE225 or cyclopamine as compared to vehicle (DMSO) (Fig. 2B). NVP-LDE225 induces G1 cell cycle arrest in human melanoma cell lines in vitro. Human melanoma cells were synchronized in G1-phase by using thymidine block. Cell cycle analysis performed 8 hr after treatment with NVP-LDE225, cyclopamine or DMSO (vehicle) showed significantly higher number of diploid 2 N cells (cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle) after NVP-LDE225 treatment as compared to vehicle (DMSO) (Fig. 3). The G1 cell cycle arrest after cyclopamine treatment was less pronounced than NVP-LDE225. NVP-LDE225 treatment results in decreased viability and induction of apoptotic cell death in human melanoma cell lines in vitro. Human melanoma cell lines were treated with different concentrations of NVP-LDE225, cyclopamine or the vehicle (DMSO). Viability of cells was assessed by MTT assay. There was a significant reduction of cell viability after treatment of cells with NVP-LDE225 and cyclopamine which was dose and time dependent. Interestingly, decreased tumor cell viability was more potent after NVP-LDE225 treatment as compared to after its natural counterpart cyclopamine treatment (Fig. 4 and Figure S2). Decreased viability of human melanoma cell lines (LOX-IMVI, UACC-257 and MEL-FH) after NVP-LDE225 treatment was accompanied by changes in cell morphology including appearance of blebs and cell disintegration into apoptotic bodies (data not shown). This could be confirmed by annexin V staining where there was a significant induction of annexin V positive/propidium iodide negative apoptotic cells after NVP-LDE225, as compared to vehicle (DMSO) treatment (Fig. 5 and Figure S2). There was no induction of apoptosis after cyclopamine treatment at respected time point (48 hr). Dose response curves for cell growth to NVP-LDE225 or cyclopamine are demonstrated in Figure S3. NVP-LDE225 possesses antitumor activity against human melanoma and reduces GLI1 expression in vivo. In the next step we investigated whether intratumorally administered NVP-LDE225 is able to inhibit the growth of human melanoma cells in athymic Nude-Foxn1 nu/nu mice. 1\u00a1\u00bf10 6 LOX IMVI human melanoma cells suspended in PBS containing 10% FCS were injected s.c into both flanks. As tumors reach the mean volume of 48 mm 3, NVP-LDE225 or cyclopamine were injected on daily basis at doses of 2, 20 or 200 \u00a5\u00ecg/shot. NVP-LDE225 as its natural counterpart cyclopamine induced a significant antitumor response (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01). Interestingly, 2 \u00a5\u00ecg of NVP-LDE225 was as effective as 200 \u00a5\u00ecg of cyclopamine (Fig. 6 A, B and D). Doses of NVP-LDE225 less than 2 \u00a5\u00ecg, 0.2 and 0.02 \u00a5\u00ecg showed non-significant or no antitumor response, respectively (Fig. 6 C). Both NVP-LDE225 and cyclopamine were well tolerated as mice showed no signs of weight loss or cachexia (data not shown). Immunofluorescent microscopy staining for GLI1 expression showed decreased expression upon NVP-LDE225 treatment but not vehicle (Fig. 7). Discussion. Multiple genetic alterations have been characterized in human melanoma [57]. Among them are the activating mutations in the NRAS (Q61R) and BRAF (V600E), the upstream MAPK signaling pathway members [57]. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that targeting BRAF V600E in patients with this mutation is accompanied with a significant clinical response [9], [58], [59], [60]. As it has been the case for other oncogenic kinase inhibitors, response to PLX4032 is rapid but short lasting [60]. Some of the mechanisms that may underlie resistance to RAF inhibitors are de novo mutations in upstream kinase NRAS, spatial configuration of ARAF/BRAF/CRAF complex with subsequent activation of MEK-ERK pathway in a BRAF-independent manner, overexpression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8 MAP3K8, or COT, which phosphorylates MEK in a RAF-independent manner and activation of other pathways (such as platelet derived growth factor receptor \u00a5\u00e2 (PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed in cellular models selected for RAF-inhibitor resistance in cell culture and in a subgroup of biopsy samples obtained from patients with progressing tumors) [61], [62], [63]. Based on these observations one can hypothesize that downstream targets of above mentioned signaling pathways could be more favorable for therapeutic applications which are largely unknown in human melanoma. Recently, several reports have shown that the HH-GLI signaling pathway plays an important role in RAS-induced tumorigenesis (among them melanoma) and that MAPK signaling pathway regulates the expression of GLI1 expression [37], [38], [40]. Stecca B. et al. [37] has reported that SHH-GLI signaling regulates the proliferation and survival of human melanoma in vitro and that growth, metastasis and recurrence in melanoma xenografts in mice are prevented by local or systemic interference of SHH-GLI function by using cyclopamine or siRNA against smoothened [37]. Moreover, others showed that oncogenic RAS-induced melanomas in transgenic mice express GLI1 and require SHH-GLI signaling in vitro and in vivo and that endogenous RAS-MEK and AKT signaling regulates the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of GLI1 in melanoma [37]. In our study the expression of the SHH-GLI signaling pathway target GLI1 could be detected in 18 human melanoma cell lines and normal human melanocytes at mRNA level demonstrating the activity of this signaling pathway in human melanoma cell lines in vitro. This could be further confirmed in vivo in primary human melanomas and melanoma metastases by gene expression profiling (data not shown). Interestingly, in accordance with previous observations that MAPK signaling pathway leads to activation of HHG signaling pathway, the BRAF V600E mutation in primary human melanomas was associated with significantly higher expression of GLI1 as compared to the primary melanomas harboring wild type BRAF molecules. Consistently, inhibition of the BRAF V600E in human melanoma cell lines using the specific inhibitor PLX-4032 (vemurafenib) resulted in substantial decrease in the expression of the downstream BRAF target phopho-ERK 1/2 as expected but also in GLI1 further confirming that GLI1 being a target of MAPK signaling pathway and that MAPK and SHH-GLI pathway do interact with each other in melanoma. Cyclopamine (11-deoxojervine) is a natural chemical compound that belongs to the group of steroidal jerveratrum alkaloids. It is a teratogen isolated from the corn lily (veratrum californicum) that causes usually fatal birth defects. It can prevent the fetal brain from dividing into two lobes (holoprosencephaly) through inhibition of SHH-GLI and causes the development of a single eye (cyclopia). Cyclopamine is useful in studying the role of HH in the biology of cancer cells but due to its low specificity and side effects is not suitable for clinical use. Recently several novel and more specific small molecule inhibitors of SHH have been reported [64]. NVP-LDE225 has been shown to be a potent and specific inhibitor of smoothened [46]. It possesses antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo against a panel of human cancer cell lines [46]. Skvara et al. [65] has shown that this compound in a topical formulation has a significant antitumor activity against BCCs in Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) also known as Gorlin?Goltz syndrome [66]. A clinical trial testing the effect of oral formulation of this compound in the above mentioned group of patients is currently ongoing (personal communication). In this study we show that NVP-LDE225 as well as the natural compound cyclopamine inhibit transcription of GLI1 in human melanoma cell lines. NVP-LDE225 induces G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This is in line with the effects seen with MAPK inhibitors in melanoma cells [67] and cyclopamine in other cancer cell lines [68]. The GI 50 dose of NVP-LDE225 in human melanoma cells was significantly lower than cyclopamine. Interestingly, the cell lines MEL FH and Mm329 being wild type for both BRAF and NRAS were also sensitive to NVP-LDE225 and the sensitivity was higher in comparison to cyclopamine. This needs further evaluation on more cell lines with similar geneotype and could potentially bear immense therapeutic benefit in BRAF Wild Type patients which are completely resistant to vemurafenib. Finally, we demonstrate that NVP-LDE225 possesses a potent antitumor activity against human melanoma in vivo. This effect is significantly superior to the natural counterpart cyclopamine. The therapeutic effect of NVP-LDE225 was not associated with any visible adverse events in mice including weight loss or abnormal neurological behaviour. Inhibition of SHH-GLI signalling pathway in BCC and medulloblastoma using specific inhibitors is accompanied by a significant clinical response [53], [65], [69], [70]. This has also resulted in the usage of these compounds against other solid and hematologic malignancies, either alone or in combination with other therapeutic strategies in the setting of clinical trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=GDC-0449 and http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=LDE). In melanoma, a lack of complete clinical response (in patients harbouring BRAF V600E mutation) to vemurafenib necessitates identification of novel therapeutic targets in melanoma. On the other hand there are no effective therapeutic strategies in patients with wild type BRAF tumors. Based on our data we can conclude that NVP-LDE2 can be potential therapeutic drug in human melanoma and is worth being further investigated. Supporting Information.

                "text": "Flavopiridol Synergizes with Sorafenib to Induce Cytotoxicity and Potentiate Antitumorigenic Activity in EGFR/HER-2 and Mutant RAS/RAF Breast Cancer Model Systems 1, 2\tOncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling through the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk (Ras-MAPK) pathway is implicated in a wide array of carcinomas, including those of the breast. The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are implicated in regulating proliferative and survival signaling downstream of this pathway. Here, we show that CDK inhibitors exhibit an order of magnitude greater cytotoxic potency than a suite of inhibitors targeting RTK and Ras-MAPK signaling in cell lines representative of clinically recognized breast cancer (BC) subtypes. Drug combination studies show that the pan-CDK inhibitor, flavopiridol (FPD), synergistically potentiated cytotoxicity induced by the Raf inhibitor, sorafenib (SFN). This synergy was most pronounced at sub-EC 50 SFN concentrations in MDA-MB-231 (KRAS-G13D and BRAF-G464V mutations), MDA-MB-468 [epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression], and SKBR3 [ErbB2/EGFR2 (HER-2) overexpression] cells but not in hormone-dependent MCF-7 and T47D cells. Potentiation of SFN cytotoxicity by FPD correlated with enhanced apoptosis, suppression of retinoblastoma (Rb) signaling, and reduced Mcl-1 expression. SFN and FPD were also tested in an MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad engraftment model of tumorigenesis. Mice treated with both drugs exhibited reduced primary tumor growth rates and metastatic tumor load in the lungs compared to treatment with either drug alone, and this correlated with greater reductions in Rb signaling and Mcl-1 expression in resected tumors. These findings support the development of CDK and Raf co-targeting strategies in EGFR/HER-2-overexpressing or RAS/RAF mutant BCs. Introduction. Chemotherapy-related morbidity and drug-resistant recurrence have prompted intensive investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis. These efforts have led to the development of monotargeted therapies such as trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, and lapatinib, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor to target ErbB2/epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive breast cancer (BC) [1?3]. Notwithstanding these early successes, the use of these monotargeted therapies alongside chemotherapy has been fraught with clinical dilemmas including intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity, intrinsic and adaptive drug resistance, and off-target toxicity [4,5]. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER-1/ErbB1) and HER-2 have been implicated in BC pathogenesis. HER-2 is over-expressed in approximately 20% of BC cases and is associated with poor prognosis [3], while EGFR has been shown to be overexpressed in 35% of recurrent cases [6]. Expression of EGFR in BC has been inversely correlated with relapse-free survival and is associated with a lack of response to hormone therapy [7]. Both EGFR and HER-2 regulate downstream tumor cell proliferation and survival through the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk (Ras-MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathways. Mutations in RAS, RAF, PI3K, and PTEN are strongly associated with tumor initiation and progression and have been identified with high frequency in various malignancies including BC [8,9]. The Ras-MAPK pathway is a common downstream pathway for numerous RTK systems and is a major focal point in cancer therapy development [8]. Upstream RTK overexpression or activating mutations in RAS and RAF are strongly implicated in driving oncogenesis through constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The Ras-Raf oncogenic axis transduces survival and proliferative signals through both Mek-Erk-dependent and Mek-Erk-independent Raf signaling pathways [10]. Hence, Raf is a regulatory nexus in RTK-mediated proliferative and survival signaling and its inhibition has become a central strategy in the development of treatments for melanoma, kidney, liver, and breast carcinoma [11,12]. In addition to Raf, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have also emerged as attractive targets for cancer intervention [13]. CDKs are an important regulatory component of the retinoblastoma (Rb)?E2F signaling axis. The Rb-E2F axis can be activated by Mek-Erk-dependent or Mek-Erk-independent Raf signaling [10]. Activation through Mek-Erk-dependent signaling occurs through cyclin D1 induction and subsequent assembly of cyclin D1?CDK4/CDK6 and ?CDK2 complexes. These complexes promote Rb phosphorylation, resulting in Rb-E2F dissociation and G1-S cell cycle transition through E2F-dependent transcriptional programs. Perturbation of the Rb-E2F signaling axis commonly occurs in cancer through gene amplifications, deletions, and functional alterations of its key signaling regulators. Perturbations frequently involve loss of Rb, cyclin D1 amplification, or CDK4 overexpression; these alterations have been associated with poor prognosis in many cancers including HER-2-positive BC [14?16]. Sorafenib (SFN; BAY 43-9006; Nexavar) is a broad-spectrum multi-kinase small molecule inhibitor. In vitro recombinant kinase assays have shown that SFN potently inhibits both the CRAF (Raf-1) and BRAF isoforms, including the highly oncogenic V600E variant [17]. SFN disrupts Ras-MAPK signaling in cell-based assays and this has been correlated with antitumor effects in colon, kidney, lung, and breast xenograft models [11,17]. SFN has been approved for treatment in advanced renal cell and hepatocellular carcinoma [18,19]. Most recently, SFN has been shown to increase progression-free survival in HER-2-negative metastatic BC when used in combination with capecitabine [12]. Flavopiridol (FPD; HMR-1275; Alvocidib) is a small molecule semisynthetic alkaloid that competes with ATP to inhibit CDK-1, -2, -4, -6, -7, and -9 [20]. This pan-CDK inhibitor exhibited considerable promise in phase I and II trials, showing partial or complete response as well as disease stabilization in advanced malignancies including ovarian, pancreas, gastric, and colon cancers and BC [21,22]. CDK inhibitors with increased selectivity (i.e., AZD5438 and PD0332991) have also been developed, which inhibit Rb-associated tumorigenesis in various preclinical human tumor xenograft models [23,24]. Cell-based studies have shown that FPD and other CDK inhibitors induce cell cycle arrests in G 1-S or G 2-M that are associated with antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects. CDK-induced cytotoxicity may underlie systemic toxicity issues of FPD and other CDK inhibitors in clinical trials [24?26]. In this study, we tested the cytotoxic potency and efficacy of a panel of RTK pathway (RTK-P) and CDK inhibitors across cell line models representative of clinically recognized BC subtypes. CDK inhibitors were found to exhibit significantly greater cytotoxic potency than RTK-P inhibitors in all tested lines. FPD most strongly potentiated cytotoxicity induced by SFN in vitro and in vivo. Potentiation occurred in cell lines harboring constitutive Ras-MAPK activation associated with EGFR/HER-2 overexpression or KRAS-BRAF mutations. Our data suggest that co-targeting CDKs and the Ras-MAPK pathway with FPD and SFN, respectively, enhances SFN killing efficacy at low doses. These data suggest a potential role for FPD in potentiating SFN therapeutic efficacy in the clinic. Materials and Methods. Cell Lines and Reagents. MDA-MB-468, SK-BR3, MCF-7, and T47D BC lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MDA-MB-231 cells were provided by Dr Peter Siegel (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec). SFN, FPD, lapatinib, and erlotinib were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario). Fascaplysin, U0126, LY294002, and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"U73122\",\"term_id\":\"4098075\",\"term_text\":\"U73122\"}}U73122 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, Ontario). AZD5438 and PD0332991 were purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX). SFN and FPD used for xenograft studies were acquired from UHN Shanghai R&D Co (Shanghai, China). Cytotoxicity Assay. Cells (2 x 10 4 per well in 96-well plates) were treated with increasing concentrations of the indicated drugs for 72 hours in standard culture media. For drug combination experiments, cells were treated with varying concentrations of a primary drug in the presence of a fixed concentration (0.2 \u00a5\u00ecM) of a secondary drug. Cell viability was assessed by metabolic activity using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Drug interactions were analyzed using CALCUSYN software by Chou and Talalay (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO) that quantitatively assesses the nature of drug interactions using multiple drug effect/combination index (MDE-CI) isobologram analysis. This analysis calculates a CI for drug interactions. CI values less than 0.9 indicate synergy; CI values between 0.9 and 1.1 indicate additivity, and CI values greater than 1.1 indicate antagonism [27]. F a reflects the proportion of cells killed or no longer viable as a result of drug treatment and was calculated using the following equation: F a = (A 570 control - A 570 treated)/A 570 control [2,28]. Apoptosis Assay. Cells (1 x 10 6 cell per well in a six-well plate) were treated with the indicated drugs for 24 hours. After treatment, cells were incubated (30 minutes, 37\u00a1\u00c6C) with propidium iodide (PI) and the annexin XII-based phosphatidylserine fluorescent sensor pSIVA-IANBD (Imgenex, San Diego, CA). Annexin XII +|PI - cells representative of apoptotic cells were counted on a Beckman Coulter flow cytometer (Mississauga, Ontario). Signaling Experiments. Cells (1 x 10 7 per 10-cm plate) were treated with SFN or FPD alone or in combination at the indicated times and concentrations in standard culture media. After treatment, cells were lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and clarified by centrifugation (12,000g, 10 minutes). Equal quantities of protein were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and assayed by immunoblot (IB) analysis using the indicated antibodies. All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Preclinical In Vivo Drug Testing. Logarithmically growing MDA-MB-231 cells were resuspended in 1:1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/Matrigel (Sigma-Aldrich) solution. Fifty microliters (2 x 10 6 cells) of the solution was injected into the right inguinal mammary gland of BalbC-RAG2 -/-|IL2R\u00a5\u00e3c -/- mice (kindly provided by Dr M. Ito, Central Institute of Experimental Animals, Kawasaki, Japan). SFN was dissolved in H 2O containing 12.5% Cremophor EL (Sigma-Aldrich) and 12.5% ethanol and administered by oral gavage [29]. FPD was dissolved in PBS and administered by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.). Mice were randomized into four cohorts (six/cohort). The control cohort received PBS (i.p.) and treatment cohorts received either SFN (30 mg/kg, oral gavage), FPD(3mg/kg, i.p.), or SFN-FPD (30 and 3 mg/kg, respectively) [17,30]. Treatment was initiated 7 days post-engraftment and continued every 2 days for 28 days. Tumor sizes were measured every 2 days using calipers. After 35 days, tumors were resected, bisected, and either lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer for IB analysis or formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) for histologic analysis. IBs were quantified using Image J software [31]. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based identification of lung-metastasized xenografted MDA-MB-231 cells was performed using the human Cep17 SpectrumGreen Probe (D17Z1, 17p11.1-q11.1 Alpha Satellite DNA; Abbott Molecular, Markham, Ontario) and counterstained for nuclei with 4\u00a1\u00c7,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Ten randomly selected regions representative of general whole lung morphology from each lung section were independently assessed for total FISH Cep17 signal and nuclei number using ePATHOLOGY IMAGESCOPE (Aperio, Vista, CA) and IMAGEPRO software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD). The ratio of Cep17 probe signals to DAPI-stained nuclei was calculated to determine the relative burden of MDAMB-231 cells metastasized in murine lungs from each treatment cohort. Results. CDK Inhibitors Are Significantly More Cytotoxic than RTK-P Inhibitors. The kill efficacy (K Eff; maximal number of cells killed) and cytotoxic potency (EC 50; dose required to induce half-maximal cell kill) of a panel of RTK-P inhibitors targeting EGFR/HER-2, Raf, Mek, PI3K, and phospholipase C (PLC) were compared to a panel of CDK inhibitors (Table 1) in five BC cell lines. In metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells, the K Eff of CDK and RTK-P inhibitors spanned similar ranges (21?100%; Table 2). In contrast, the EC 50 ranges for the CDK inhibitor panel were markedly lower than the EC 50 ranges for the RTK-P panel (0.2?0.7 \u00a5\u00ecM vs 8.6?36.4 \u00a5\u00ecM, respectively; Table 2). These differences were clearly indicated by the cytotoxicity profiles of the CDK inhibitors, which clustered distinctly left of RTK-P profiles on the dose axis (Figure 1A). Subsequent estimation of the average EC 50 of the two inhibitor panels showed that CDK inhibitors induce cell death with approximately 54-fold more potency than RTK-P inhibitors in MDA-MB-231 cells (Table 2). To investigate whether this potency enhancement was cell-line specific, EGFR-overexpressing (MDA-MB-468), HER-2-overexpressing (SKBR3), and hormone-dependent (MCF-7 and T47D) BC cell lines were also tested (Table 3). The K Eff of CDK and RTK-P inhibitors in these lines spanned ranges comparable to those in MDA-MB-231 cells. More strikingly however, the CDK cytotoxicity profiles of these four lines also clustered distinctly left of the RTK-P profiles on the dose axis (Figure 1, B?E). Taken together, these results indicate that CDK inhibitors induce cytotoxicity with significantly greater potency than RTK-P inhibitors in BC lines. FPD and Fascaplysin Potentiate SFN Cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 Cells. The marked increases in potency observed with the CDK inhibitor panel underscored their potential use as cytotoxicity-enhancing agents for therapies targeting the Ras-MAPK pathway. This prompted us to explore potential synergistic cytotoxic effects of CDK inhibitors with the Raf inhibitor SFN in MDA-MB-231 cells. These cells harbor oncogenic KRAS and BRAF mutations associated with constitutive Ras-MAPK signaling (Table 3). When CDK inhibitors were added at fixed concentrations to varying concentrations of SFN, cytotoxicity was potentiated in this line (Figure 2, A and B). Potentiation was substantially more pronounced with FPD and fascaplysin than with either PD0332991 or AZD5438 at SFN concentrations below its EC 50 (\u00a1\u00c25 \u00a5\u00ecM; compare Figure 2, A and B to C and D). The fraction of cells killed by 0.2 \u00a5\u00ecM of either FPD or fascaplysin alone was significantly less than that observed in combination with SFN, indicating that these combinations can potentiate cytotoxicity to levels greater than the summed effects of individual drugs (compare shaded line with drug response curves in Figure 2, A and B). We further assessed the nature of these drug interactions using MDE-CI analysis (see Materials and Methods section) [2,27]. This analysis yielded CI values indicative of synergy (<0.9) and additivity (0.9?1.1) at the higher range of tested ratio combinations (Figure 2, A and B, lower panels, black and gray bars, respectively). Synergy was associated with FPD/SFN and fascaplysin/SFN combination ratios ranging from 1:6 to 1:25. MDE-CI analysis did not indicate synergistic or additive interactions between PD0332991 or AZD5438 and SFN (Figure 2, C and D, lower panels). Taken together, these results show that specific ratio combinations of SFN and the CDK inhibitor FPD or fascaplysin synergistically potentiate cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells. FPD Potentiates SFN Cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-468 and SKBR3 Cells. We extended our analyses to MDA-MB-468, SKBR3, MCF-7, and T47D cells and focused efforts on FPD, which has undergone extensive testing in clinical trials [22,25,26]. Interestingly, FPD failed to potentiate cytotoxicity in hormone-dependent MCF-7 and T47D cells (Figure 3, A and B, upper panels). Consistent with this, synergistic interactions between these drugs were not detected in these lines (Figure 3, A and B, lower panels). We next tested for potentiating interactions between these drugs in MDA-MB-468 and SKBR3 cells, which harbor constitutive Ras-MAPK signaling associated with EGFR and HER-2 overexpression, respectively (Table 3). Exploration of drug ratio combinations in MDA-MB-468 cells indicated synergy between FPD and SFN ratios ranging from 1:6 to 1:25; these interactions became additive as ratios decreased (Figure 3C). Synergy was only indicated at the highest FPD to SFN ratio tested in SKBR3 cells (1:6; Figure 3D). As observed in MDA-MB-231 cells, synergy was only evident at SFN concentrations below the EC 50 of the tested lines. Together with the observations made in MDA-MB-231 cells, these data suggest that specific ratio combinations of FPD and SFN synergistically potentiate cytotoxicity in BC cells harboring constitutive Ras-MAPK signaling. FPD Potentiates SFN-Induced Apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 Cells. Combination studies showed that FPD-SFN used at a ratio of 1:25 induced cytotoxic synergy in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB468 cells (Figures 2A and ?and3C).3C). Focusing on these two lines, we tested whether the same FPD-SFN combination ratio could also potentiate apoptosis. Annexin XII-based phosphatidylserine-binding assays showed that FPD and SFN alone induced levels of apoptosis that were significantly less than that induced by FPD-SFN combinations used at 1:25 ratios in MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4A) and MDA-MB-468 (Figure 4B) cells. The enhancement produced by the combination was greater than theoretically expected additive effects, suggesting that these drugs synergistically interact to induce programmed cell death in both lines (Figure 4, A and B). These data suggest that a 1:25 ratio of FPD-SFN supra-additively potentiates apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. FPD and SFN Cooperatively Dysregulate Rb and Mcl-1. The Ras-MAPK and Rb-E2F signaling axes play critical roles in cancer cell proliferation and survival [8,14]. Assessment of Ras-MAPK activity using an active-state antibody against Erk (pErk) showed that SFN alone strongly suppressed pErk in MDA-MB-231 cells for up to 2 hours before undergoing periodic oscillations in activity at 4 and 24 hours (Figure 5A). This periodic Erk signal recovery could represent normal oscillatory behavior of Erk activity recently described in asynchronously growing cells [32]. Expectedly, FPD did not affect pErk signaling in this line (Figure 5B), and consistent with this, it did not significantly alter Erk inhibition when added to SFN (Figure 5C). In MDA-MB-468 cells, FPD and SFN alone or in combination failed to inhibit pErk signaling (Figure 5, D?F). Signaling through the Rb-E2F pathway was also assessed by Rb phosphorylation (pRb) at S807/811 [33]. pRb was partially suppressed by SFN and only intermittently by FPD in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5, A and B). However, when FPD was combined with SFN, maximal suppression was observed for the full length of the treatment period (Figure 5C). In contrast, FPD or SFN alone or in combination failed to suppress pRb in MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 5, D?F). Lastly, SFN and FPD in combination reduced expression of Mcl-1 to greater extents than either drug alone in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 5, A?F). These data suggest that pRb suppression and reduced Mcl-1 expression underlie enhanced cytotoxicity associated with FPD-SFN combinations. Maximal Tumor Growth Suppression In Vivo with FPD and SFN Coadministration. We next tested whether FPD-SFN combinations could potentiate antitumor activity in vivo. MDA-MB-231 cells were orthotopically engrafted in mammary fat pads of BalbC-RAG2 -/-|IL2R\u00a5\u00e3c -/- mice. FPD and SFN alone or in combination at a 1:10 ratio?which falls within the 1:6 to 1:25 range observed in vitro?was administered to assess relative effects on antitumor activity. SFN alone significantly reduced the rate of tumor development relative to control mice (Figure 6A) [17]. FPD alone also significantly suppressed tumor development rates compared to controls, although not to the same extent observed with SFN. FPD and SFN in combination, however, produced the greatest level of tumor growth suppression (Figure 6A). Importantly, all six mice of each treatment cohort survived with no adverse toxicity reactions of weight loss. Thus, FPD-SFN combinations associated with enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in vitro also promote antitumor effects when administered at a similar ratio in vivo. Cooperative Inhibition of Pulmonary Metastatic Tumor Load by Combined FPD and SFN Treatment. Whole lungs resected after 35 days of treatment were examined for histologic evidence of metastases (Figures W1?W3). Pathologic assessment suggested that metastatic tumor burden in the lung was significantly less in the SFN-treated group compared to the FPD- or control-treated group (Figure W1). FISH analyses quantifying the ratio of human-specific Cep17 signal to the number of DAPI-stained nuclei corroborated this pathologic assessment (Figure W2) and further verified that the number of metastatic BC cells in the lung was suppressed by either FPD or SFN treatment alone. The most pronounced suppression, however, was observed with FPD and SFN co-treatment (Figure 6B), which paralleled the suppressive effects of this combination on tumor growth at the orthotopic site. FPD and SFN Combinations Maximally Inhibited Erk, Rb, and Mcl-1 In Vivo. The molecular mechanisms underlying tumor suppression were assessed by measuring pErk, pRb, and Mcl-1 expression in resected tumors (Figure 7A). In comparison to the control cohort, the FPD-treated group did not show significant differences in pErk inhibition (Figure 7B), Rb phosphorylation (Figure 7C), or Mcl-1 expression (Figure 7D). SFN also failed to suppress Rb phosphorylation and paradoxically increased pErk and Mcl-1 levels. However, FPD and SFN in combination affected all three signaling proteins as indicated by significant reductions in pErk, pRb, and Mcl-1 levels relative to controls (Figure 7, B?D). These data show that combined FPD and SFN treatment maximally suppress levels of pErk, pRb, and Mcl-1, and this correlates with the enhanced antitumor effects produced by this combination. Discussion. Overexpression of RTKs or activating mutations residing within nodes of the Ras-Raf-MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways are associated with poor prognosis and have become focal points of targeted therapy strategies. We evaluated the general merit of such strategies in BC by exploring the cytotoxic effects of a panel of RTK-P inhibitors targeting EGFR, HER-2, PLC, Raf, Mek, and PI3K in cell lines representative of EGFR/HER-2-overexpressing, hormone-dependent, and triple-negative (TN) BC subtypes. Our findings showed that the mean cytotoxic potency (EC 50) of the RTK-P inhibitor panel was narrow, ranging from 16 to 29 \u00a5\u00ecM across all lines (Table 2). In comparison, a panel of four CDK inhibitors with highly varied substrate specificities exhibited a very tight mean potency range of 0.4 to 0.7 \u00a5\u00ecM across the same five lines (Table 2). These relatively narrow ranges suggest that improvements in potency achievable within anti-RTK-P or anti-CDK treatment modalities are limited. Across these modalities however, we see compelling improvements in cytotoxic potential. Our data show that the average EC 50 of the CDK inhibitor panel is well over an order of magnitude less than the average EC 50 of the RTK-P inhibitor panel (0.45 \u00a5\u00ecM vs 21.7 \u00a5\u00ecM, respectively) reflecting a 48-fold improvement in potency. Perhaps more compelling is the ubiquity of this improvement across a morphologically and clinically diverse panel of BC lines (Table 3). These data clearly indicate that CDK targeting is a substantially more potent alternative to inducing cell death than RTK-P targeting. The reasons for this are presently unclear but may be due to the fact that CDKs lie downstream of RTK-P targets and constitute a major regulatory point of mitogenic and survival signal convergence. The potency with which CDK inhibitors induce cell death indicates that BC cell survival may be highly sensitive to disruption in CDK activity. Consistent with this, FPD and fascaplysin strongly potentiated SFN cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 2). MDE-CI analysis indicated that FPD or fascaplysin synergistically interacts with SFN. Focusing on the clinically tested drug FPD, we also observed synergy with SFN in MDA-MB-468 and SKBR3 cells but not in hormone-dependent MCF-7 and T47D cells (Figure 3). Cytotoxic synergy in all lines occurred at low (sub-EC 50) SFN concentrations and at FPD-SFN ratios ranging from 1:6 to 1:25. We also observed that cytotoxic synergy correlated with supra-additive effects on apoptosis at a 1:25 combination ratio. This ratio falls within the 1:6 to 1:25 range associated with cytotoxic synergy, suggesting a link between cell death and the induction of apoptotic mechanisms by these drugs (Figure 4). Taken together, our data show that FPD synergizes with SFN at specific combination ratios to induce cell death in EGFR/HER-2 and mutant RAS/RAF BC model systems. We hypothesize that the ability of FPD to synergize with SFN in these models may be associated with dependency on constitutively elevated EGFR/HER2 and Ras-MAPK activity. Interestingly, FPD has previously been shown to synergize with trastuzumab in inducing cytotoxicity in HER-2 BC lines through apoptotic mechanisms that involved suppression of EGFR expression [34]. In line with our observations, synergy between FPD and trastuzumab was not observed in hormone-dependent cells [34]. FPD has also been shown to promote lethality of the dual EGFR/HER-2 inhibitor lapatinib in a greater than additive manner [35]. The latter studies support our observations and, together, highlight the importance of co-targeting strategies centered on inhibiting Ras-MAPK and CDK signaling concurrently. Significant toxicity issues in phase I FPD trials have been observed with maximal tolerable doses (MTDs) of FPD including leukopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, and pro-inflammatory syndrome [36]. In this study, animal cohorts were treated with sub-MTDs of FPD, SFN, or FPD-SFN. In addition, Cremophor EL, a polyethoxylated castor oil commonly used to improve water solubility of SFN and other drugs, was used at levels below reported toxicity thresholds in mice [29,37]. Importantly, adverse toxicity issues such as lethality or severe weight loss were not observed in any of the individual cohorts over the course of the treatment period (vehicle, 22.8 \u00a1\u00be 0.09 g; SFN, 25.5 \u00a1\u00be 0.04 g; FPD, 24.6 \u00a1\u00be 0.08 g; SFN + FPD, 26.7 \u00a1\u00be 0.06 g; mean \u00a1\u00be SD). At these nontoxic sub-MTDs, FPD potentiated the antitumor effects of SFN in a mammary xenograft tumor model highlighting its potential use at low-toxicity doses in FPD-SFN combination modalities [30,38,39]. Cytotoxic potentiation by FPD, however, was associated with FPD-SFN ratios ranging from 1:6 to 1:25 in cell lines. This would limit the maximal SFN concentration in such combinations to about 5 \u00a5\u00ecM that is 25-fold more than FPD (0.2 \u00a5\u00ecM) and is below the EC 50 of SFN. At sub-EC 50 SFN concentrations, the maximal kill efficacy (K Eff) of the cocktail is in the order of 50% to 60% (Figure 2A). This suggests that reduced systemic toxicity associated with the use of synergistic sub-MTD FPD-sub-EC 50 SFN ratios come at the expense of a 40% to 50% reduction in K Eff. Assuming these ratios are also synergistic at higher FPD concentrations (i.e., 0.8 \u00a5\u00ecM), the maximal SFN concentration allowed at a 1:25 ratio would be 20 \u00a5\u00ecM. At this concentration, the K Eff of the cocktail would be approximately 90%, which is 15% greater than the K Eff of SFN alone. Under this assumption, synergy (and its associated benefit of reduced systemic toxicity) would not come at the expense of a loss in K Eff. Importantly, we used a 1:10 FPD/SFN dosing ratio in mice that falls within ratio boundaries for cytotoxic potentiation determined in cell lines (1:6-1:25). Thus, drug ratio effects observed in vitro may correlate with effects in vivo, supporting the use of cell-based drug ratio studies for guiding initial dosing experiments in preclinical mouse models. However, it remains unclear what the true impact of changes in FPD/SFN ratios and/or doses would be on systemic toxicity and tumor response in the clinic. It also remains unclear whether potential reductions in toxicity associated with FPD-SFN combinations come at the expense of an overall loss in tumor response. The latter questions, including possible trade-offs between toxicity and tumor response, still remain to be addressed in the clinic. Erk inhibition by SFN in MDA-MB-231 cells correlated with reductions in Mcl-1 expression levels and suppression of pRb, suggesting that Mcl-1 and Rb are regulated by Mek-Erk-dependent signaling. Reduced Mcl-1 expression and Rb phosphorylation have been previously correlated with antiapoptotic and proliferative effects associated with inhibition of the Ras-MAPK pathway [40]. For example, Mcl-1 induction downstream of the Ras-MAPK signaling has been shown to promote BC cell survival [41]. In addition, phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of Rb through cyclin D1 induction downstream of the Ras-MAPK pathway was shown to lock cells in G1 and induce apoptosis [14,24]. Our results therefore are consistent with a model in which Mek-Erk-dependent Raf signal suppression by SFN inhibits downstream Mcl-1 and pRb-dependent survival signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5). SFN also inhibited Mcl-1 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells but paradoxically increased Erk and Rb signaling. Failure to suppress Erk signaling suggested that Mek-Erk-independent Raf signaling mechanisms may contribute to survival in this line, possibly through inhibition of direct Rb-Raf interactions or Rb phosphorylation by Raf [13,42]. Consistent with this, SFN has previously been shown to promote apoptosis with Mcl-1 suppression through Mek-Erk-independent mechanisms [11,43?45]. However, the mechanistic basis for the paradoxical increases in pErk and pRb in these cells is unclear. SFN has been shown to dose-dependently activate CRAF through BRAF-CRAF dimerization [46,47]. SFN was also shown to induce CRAF (and downstream Erk activation) in epithelial cells isolated from polycystic livers through a protein kinase A-dependent BRAF-CRAF dimerization mechanism [47]. It is hence plausible that in MDA-MB-468 cells, SFN induces CRAF activation through BRAF heterodimerization leading to enhanced pErk and pRb signaling through Mek-Erk-dependent and ?independent pathways, respectively. FPD, which has been shown to induce apoptosis through Mcl-1 [35,48], enhanced the extent to which Mcl-1 levels were suppressed by SFN in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. FPD also enhanced the durability of suppression of Rb phosphorylation by SFN in MDA-MB-231 cells. The failure of FPD to inhibit Erk suggests that the latter FPD effects are Mek-Erk independent, likely involving direct inhibition of CDKs. Thus, FPD-SFN-potentiating effects on pRb suppression and reduction of Mcl-1 expression correlate with cytotoxic synergy exhibited by this combination at the cellular level. We speculate that concomitant suppression of MekErk-dependent and -independent pathways could underlie cytotoxic synergy exhibited by SFN-FPD combinations. Similar molecular mechanisms may also operate in vivo, where the enhanced antitumor growth effects and reduced pulmonary metastatic burden of this combination correlated with maximal repression of pErk, pRb, and Mcl-1 expression (Figures 6 and ?and7).7). These observations are not without precedent. Lapatinib and CDK inhibitors (including FPD) synergized to kill BC cells in vivo and in vitro, and this correlated with inhibition of Mcl-1 expression [35]. In addition, trastuzumab and FPD synergistically inhibited proliferation of HER-2-overexpressing SKBR3 and BT474 cells and inhibited Erk signaling, cyclin D1 expression, and Rb phosphorylation more potently in combination [28]. Importantly, we cannot exclude the involvement of the antiangiogenic properties that have been associated with both SFN and FPD. SFN has been shown to directly target the RTK activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 to 3 and PDGFR-\u00a5\u00e2, while FPD has been shown to downregulate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor mRNA and protein levels induced by hypoxia [17,49,50]. Consistent with these observations, we have observed that FPD- and SFN-treated tumors exhibit reduced expression of the angiogenic marker CD31 (PECAM-1). More strikingly, combined FPD and SFN treatment correlated with lower CD31 expression levels than that observed in the presence of either drug alone (Figure W4). Taken together, these data suggest that cooperative inhibition of angiogenesis by FPD and SFN may also contribute to cytotoxic synergy exhibited by this combination. SFN alone did not inhibit Erk activity in tumors, although marked inhibition was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro. This is in agreement with a number of studies showing that inhibition of tumor growth by SFN is not always associated with Erk inhibition [51]. For example, SFN inhibited tumor growth in renal and colorectal tumor models but failed to inhibit Erk activity [17,50]. Unaffected pErk levels in response to SFN could reflect failure to detect Erk inhibition due to inappropriate sampling time or to failure to achieve sufficient inhibitor levels in microenvironmental and cell compartments. Alternatively, Erk-independent antitumor effects may be attributable to SFN's antiangiogenic function [51] or to Mek-Erk-independent antiproliferative/apoptotic Rb signaling [13,52]; this is supported by reduced pRb levels in SFN-treated MDA-MB-231 cells and tumors (Figure 7C). Lastly, FPD (and SFN) alone suppressed Mcl-1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells but failed to inhibit its expression in tumors. We propose that similar effects as those proposed for pErk apply to failed Mcl-1 suppression in tumors; these include pharmacodynamic factors, as well as the antiangiogenic function ascribed to FPD. In summary, our data show that FPD-SFN combinations exhibit cytotoxic synergy in EGFR/HER-2 and mutant RAS/RAF BC model systems. This correlates with enhanced tumor growth inhibition at the orthotopic site and with reduced pulmonary metastatic burden. These preclinical data support possible antitumor applications of FPD-SFN modalities in adjuvant and advanced settings of BC therapy. The potential therapeutic benefits of adding FPD to current SFN treatment modalities in BC are suggested by recent successes of SFN in BC trials. SFN has been shown to prolong progression-free survival of advanced or metastatic HER-2-negative BC patients previously treated with anthracyclines and/or taxanes (SOLTI-0701; [12]). SFN has also been shown to increase survival of HER-2-negative patients with disease progression during or after bevacizumab therapy [53]. Trastuzumab is currently the main targeted treatment for HER-2-positive cases and lapatinib for advanced/metastatic cases. We have observed that FPDSFN combinations exhibit synergy in the HER-2?overexpressing cell line SKBR3, supporting the use of SFN as a potential alternative to trastuzumab and lapatinib in combination with FPD (discussed above). In this context, SFN may provide potential improvements in therapeutic efficacy over HER-2 inhibitors because it directly targets RAF, a central regulatory nexus in RTK-mediated proliferative and survival signaling. Unlike HER-2 inhibitors, SFN provides the added benefit of enhancing FPD-associated antiangiogenic effects (Figure W4). Alternatively, FPD-SFN combination therapy could also be employed as antiresistance strategies in cases refractory to trastuzumab or lapatinib. Lastly, TN BC, the most aggressive BC subtype, is characterized by a lack of estrogen, progesterone, and HER-2 receptor expression and with EGFR overexpression [7,54]. The observed synergy in EGFR-overexpressing MDA-MB-468 and in TN MDA-MB-231 cell/tumor models supports the use of this combination in TN BC. Thus, FPD-SFN combination modalities may be suitable for treating HER-2-positive BC, as well as aggressive HER-2-negative BCs exhibiting EGFR or TN molecular signatures. Supplementary Material.

                "text": "Molecular Imaging of Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinomas Expressing Active Mutant EGFR Kinase Using PET with [ 124I]-Morpholino-IPQA\tMutations in the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have high levels of basal receptor phosphorylation and are associated with clinical responsiveness to Iressa in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to assess the feasibility of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA derivative as an in vivo PET imaging tool for the expression of different EGFR mutants in NSCLC. In vitro radiotracer accumulation and washout studies demonstrated a rapid accumulation and progressive retention after washout of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA derivative in high EGFR-expressing H1299 NSCLC derivative cell lines (L858R and E746-A750 del cell lines), but not in EGFR-transfected H1299 cell line and vector-transfected H1299 cell line. Using the morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA derivative, we obtained noninvasive microPET images of EGFR activity in L858R and E746-A750 del subcutaneous tumor xenografts, but not in subcutaneous tumor xenografts grown form control cell line. Different EGFR mutant (activity) tumors have a different morpholino-[ I]IPQA derivative uptake. However, it still needs to modify the structure of IPQA to increase its water solubility and reduce hepatobiliary clearance. Morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA derivative may be a potential probe for selection of the candidate patients suffering from NSCLC for the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (e.g., Iressa) in the future. 1. Introduction. Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents the majority of lung cancers [1]. Lung cancer treatment depends on several factors including tumor type, size, and patient's health. Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy using tumor specific targeted agents such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor bevacizumab and epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs) are the primary tools for treating lung cancer. These targeted agents are initially effective in certain small subpopulations of patients, but eventually nearly all patients turn out to be resistant to the further treatments [2]. The limitations in efficacy and safety associated with the existing treatments for NSCLC underscore the need for novel biomarkers and imaging approaches for identification of patients who may benefit from particular therapeutic agents and approaches with improved efficacy and safety profiles. The importance of EGFR signaling pathway in the development and progression of NSCLC has been widely recognized [3, 4]. EGFR overexpression is observed in tumors of more than 60% of patients with metastatic NSCLC and correlates with poor prognosis [5]. These observations have provided a rationale for the development of novel anticancer agents that target EGFR. Two classes of EGFR-targeted agents are currently being tested in clinical trials: antibodies that bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR (i.e., cetuximab, panitumumab, matuzumab, nimotuzumab, etc.) and small molecular inhibitors that bind to the ATP-binding site of the EGFR tyrosine kinase (i.e., gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, canertinib, etc.) [6]. Clinical trials have revealed significant variability in response to EGFR TKI gefitinib (Iressa), with approximately 10% of Caucasian patients, 25?30% of Japanese patients, and 57% of Taiwanese patients [5, 7?13]. Sequencing test of the EGFR gene is associated with a majority of tumors responding to EGFR kinase inhibitors harbor mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR [9, 14, 15]. The response rate to gefitinib and erlotinib in patients with tumors exhibiting activating mutations of EGFR is approximately 75%, suggesting that these mutations, at least in part, may have caused malignant transformation and contribute in large to the tumor maintenance pathway [16, 17]. Two subtypes of activating EGFR mutations have been described: tyrosine kinase domain mutation (45%?50%) in EGFR exons 18?24 and truncating mutations involving exon 2 to 7. The most frequently detected alterations are small deletions in exon 19 (35%?45%) that eliminate amino acids 747?750 (Leu-Arg-Glu-Ala), located around the active site of the tyrosine kinase, and point mutations in exon 21 that result in the amino acid substitution Leu858\u00a1\u00e6Arg, a residue located in the activation loop [9]. Mutations are most frequently detected in a subpopulation of NSCLC patients with characteristics associated with a better treatment outcome: women, nonsmokers, patients of southeast Asian and Japanese origins, and patients with adenocarcinoma histology and, in particular, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma [18, 19]. The mutational status of EFGR kinase could be considered as a positive predictive biomarker of response to NSCLC [20, 21]. Considerable efforts have been made over the past decade to develop radiolabeled agents for noninvasive imaging of EGFR expression and activity. These agents include radiolabeled antibodies to EGFR and radiolabeled small molecular compounds based on structures of known EGFR TKIs [22]. Most of the radiolabeled agents for molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) are derived from 4-(anilino)quinazoline pharmacophore [23, 24], which includes ML series [21, 22, 25?27], as well as [4-(3-[ 124I]iodoani-lino)-quinazolin-6-yl]-amide-(3-morpholin-4-yl-propyl)-amide ([ 124I]IPQA) [28], [ 18F]gefinitib [29], [ 11C]PD153035 [30], and [ 11C]erlotinib [31]. Recently, clinical studies with [ 11C]PD153035 have demonstrated some promise for imaging EGFR expression in NSCLC patients [32]; however, none of these imaging agents exhibits selectivity for detection of NSCLC expressing active mutant EGFR kinases or EGFR kinase mutations that confer resistance to inhibitors that are currently used in clinical practice. Therefore, we have been developing a PET radiotracer with preferential binding to active mutant EGFR kinases, not to EGFR kinase mutants conferring resistance to current small molecular inhibitors (i.e., gefitinib). PET imaging using such a selective radiolabeled agent should allow for visualization of primary and metastatic tumor lesions driven by activating mutations in EGFR kinase and selection of patients who may benefit from therapy with EGFR kinase inhibitors. Also, after the initial course of treatment with EGFR inhibitors, repetitive imaging with such a selective radiotracer could be used for monitoring the development of tumor lesions with acquired mutations (i.e., T790M) conferring resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Here, we describe the [4-(3-[ 124I]iodoani-lino)-quinazolin-6-yl]-amide-(3-morpholin-4-yl-propyl)-amide ([ 124I]morpholino-IPQA) as a PET imaging agent with increased selectivity and irreversible binding to active mutant L858R and E746-A750 del EGFR kinase, which allows for noninvasive detection of NSCLC in mouse xenografts harboring this mutation. 2. Materials and Methods. 2.1. Radiosynthesis of Morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA Derivative. Morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA derivative was synthesized from but-2-enedioic acid(3-morpholin-4-propyl)-amide[4-(3-tributylstannyl-phenyl-amino)-quinazolin-6-yl]-amide (morpholino-IPQA derivative), as described previously [28]. The radiosynthesis of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA derivative was modified according to the earlier study [33]. The tin precursor (100\u00a5\u00ecg; from MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA) was dissolved in 0.02mL of methanol, and then the [ 124I]NaI (37~55MBq) was added to the solution of precursor and vortexed followed by the addition of a 0.018mL mixture of 30% hydrogen peroxide/acetate acid (1:3). The reaction mixture was vortexed for 1min and then allowed to stand for 5min. Saturated sodium bicarbonate (0.2mL) and 2N sodium thiosulphate (0.12mL) were added to quench the reaction, and the reaction mixture was then loaded to a plus C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge system. The C-18 cartridge system (preconditioned with 10mL of ethanol, then 10mL of water) was eluted with water (30mL), followed by 20% ethanol/water (25mL), 40% ethanol/water (25mL), and 60% ethanol/water (25mL). The majority of the product was isolated during the elution with 60% ethanol/water. Each fraction was collected and assayed for radioactivity measurement, and the fractions that contain the final product were assayed by radio-thin-layer chromatography (radio-TLC). The radiochemical purity was determined by radio-TLC (silica gel 60 F254; eluent: chloroform/methanol = 6/1). The collected products with sufficient purity were combined and evaporated. 2.2. Radiosynthesis of Morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA Derivative. No carrier-added morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA derivative was prepared using the same procedure as that of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA (50\u00a5\u00ecg of the tin precursor was used). The radiolabeled product was isolated in 65% radiochemical yield (decay corrected) with a radiochemical purity of 92.3%. 2.3. Tumor Cell Lines. Human NSCLC cell line H1299 with 4 different levels of wild-type (WT) or mutant EGFR expression was selected: (a) L858R EGFR (point mutation in exon 21); (b) E746-A750 del EGFR (in frame deletion); (c) EGFR-transfected (wild-type); (d) vector-transfected (study control). Cells were grown in flasks with RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and antibiotics at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2. Cells were kept in the log phase of proliferative activity. The L858R, E746-A750del, EGFR-transfected, and vector-transfected H1299 cells were kind gifts from Drs. Shih-Feng Tsai and Yi-Rong Chen (The National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli, Taiwan). 2.4. Irreversible Binding of Morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA to Active Mutant EGFR Kinase Domain. The irreversible and covalent bindings of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA to the EGFR kinase domain were evaluated in H1299 derivatives cells. The cells were grown in a 15cm culture dish until 60?70% confluency and then incubated for one hour in fresh culture medium supplemented with 20% FBS and morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA at 0.37MBq/mL. Thereafter, the cells were harvested by scraping, pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000rpm for 5 minutes, and lysed in 0.5mL of buffer containing protein extraction reagent (Cytobuster, Novagen, USA) and aprotinin, leuppetin, pepstain (1\u00a5\u00ecg/mL for each), Na 3VO 4, NaF, and PMSF (1mM for each; Sigma-Aldrich, CA, USA). The cell lysate was cleared by 14,000\u00a1\u00bfg centrifugation at 4\u00a1\u00c6C for 15 minutes. The cell lysate supernatant was denatured by boiling with 4x Laemmli sample buffer and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using precast 8% Tris HCl gel cassettes (BioRad, CA, USA). After transferring proteins into a minitank electroblotter device, the membrane was exposed to AX film (Konica, Japan) for seven days at room temperature to produce an autoradiogram of 131I-labeled protein bands. Thereafter, the nitrocellulose transfer membrane was immunostained with a rabbit polyclonal EGFR (1005)-sc-03 antibody (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and visualized using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences, UK). The colocalization of 131I-labeled proteins in the autoradiogram with protein bands stained with anti-EGFR antibody was assessed. 2.5. In Vitro Radiotracer Uptake and Washout Assay. Radiotracer uptake and washout studies were performed in monolayer cultures of four NSCLC cell lines as described previously [28]. Briefly, tumor cells were grown in 15cm culture dishes until 60~70% confluent, at which point the cells were exposed to the culture medium without FCS to induce serum starvation (to inhibit EGFR kinase activity). The radiotracer morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA at 0.18MBq/mL was then added to fresh cell culture medium without FCS (serum-starved), and tumor cell monolayers were exposed to the radioactivity-containing medium for 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes. In the first part of the experiment, the cells were harvested by gentle scraping at different time intervals, pelleted by centrifugation (3,500rpm for 2 minutes). The cell pellet and 0.1mL of radioactive supernatant were weighed and assessed for radioactivity using a Packard 5500 gamma counter (Perkin-Elmer, CA, USA); the radioactivity concentration was expressed as cpm/g cells and cpm/mL medium, respectively. In the second part of the experiment, tumor cells exposed to the morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA containing medium for a given time interval (5, 10, 20, and 60 minutes) were washed with fresh (nonradioactive) medium for different time intervals before subsequent harvesting for measurement of retained radioactivity, as described above. Cells-to-medium radioactivity concentration ratios were calculated and plotted versus time to evaluate the radiotracer accumulation and washout kinetics. 2.6. Subcutaneous Tumor Xenografts and PET Image Acquisition and Data Analysis. NOD/SCID mice weighing about 25~30g (N = 3) were injected subcutaneously into the left shoulder region with L858R, E746-A750 del, or wild-type EGFR-transfected H1299 cells (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6cells/mouse). In the right shoulder region of each mouse, 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 of vector-transfected H1299 cells were inoculated as a control tumor. The tumors grew to about 8~10mm in diameter after 4 weeks. At this point, the mice were anesthetized (2% isoflurane/98% oxygen mixture) and injected intravenously with morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA (2.6MBq/mouse). One-hour dynamic PET imaging was performed on MicroPET R4 system (Siemens, TN, USA) and followed with a 30-minute static imaging at 24 hours after i.v. administration of radiotracer. PET images were reconstructed using the ordered subsets expectation maximization iterative reconstruction algorithm. Regions of interest were drawn over tumors and other tissues of interest. 2.7. Biodistribution of Morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA Derivative in Mice. NOD/SCID mice (n = 3/time point) were injected subcutaneously into shoulders and limbs with L858R (8 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6cells/mouse), E746-A750 del (8 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6cells/mouse), wild-type EGFR-transfected (8 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6cells/mouse), and vector-transfected H1299 cells (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6cells/mouse). Three weeks later, each mouse was injected with 0.1mL of a saline solution containing 2.6MBq of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA through the caudal vein. Animals were sacrificed by chloroform (Nacalai Tesque Inc., Japan) at different time points after i.v. administration of radiotracer. Organs of interest were collected and weighed, and the radioactivity was counted. The percent injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) was calculated and recorded. 2.8. Statistical Analysis. Group data were expressed as average \u00a1\u00be SE and compared using analysis of variance, regression analysis, and group and paired Student's t tests; a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3. Results. 3.1. Radiochemistry. The final product of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA derivative (Figure 1) was dissolved in saline (with 10% ethanol added). Radio-TLC showed the Rf value of morpholino-[ 131/124I]IPQA derivative to be 0.5. The radiochemical yield was 50%, and the radiochemical purity was \u00a1\u00c390% (decay-corrected). Radio-high-performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC) using an Alltech Alltima C18LL column (250 \u00a1\u00bf 4.6mm; Fisher Scientific, USA) and a mobile phase consisting of 0.1M acetate buffer (acetate/acetonitrile = 55/45) at a flow rate of 1.0mL/min exhibited the product as a peak at about 10 minutes. 3.2. Irreversible and Specific Bindings of Morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA to the L858R and E746-A750 Del EGFR Mutations. The autoradiographic and western blot analysis was used to demonstrate the irreversible and covalent bindings of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA in four types of NSCLC cells. The autographic electropherogram of protein extracts from these NSCLC cell lines that were pretreated with morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA demonstrated the preferential convent binding of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA to the cells with L858R and E746-A750 del EGFR mutations (Figure 2(a)) These bands were correspondent with the 172kDa protein band stained with anti-EGFR antibody (Figure 2(b)). The above observations collectively suggest that in EGFR-transfected cells (cells with wild-type EGFR overexpression) the lower radioactive intensity of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA (Figure 2(a)) corresponds to a higher level of anti-EGFR immunoblotting (Figure 2(b)) compared to EGFR mutation cells. The covalent binding of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA to the H1299 vector-transfected and MB-435S (EFGR negative cells) was barely detected by autographic electropherogram (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). 3.3. Preferential Accumulation of Morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA in NSCLC Cells with L858R and E746-A750 Del EGFR Mutations. All four types of cells showed a rapid accumulation of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA at the initial 10 minutes and thereafter reached a plateau at 60 minutes (Figures 3(a)?3(d)). In L858R and E746-A750 del cells, the cell-to-medium ratio (CMR) of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA was about 60?65 at 60 minutes, which was ~1.6-fold higher than that of wild-type EGFR-transfected H1299 cells (Table 1). In L858R and E746-A750 del cells, the loss of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA accumulation could be characterized by a rapid washout, followed by a plateau, with a slow but slightly decreased (L858R cells, Figure 3(e)) (E746-A750 del cells, Figure 3(f)) CMR over time. In contrast, wild-type EGFR-transfected H1299 cells showed consistent decrease of CMR with time (Figure 3(g)). At 120min, the washout studies showed the higher retention of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA in L858R (8.9\u00a1\u00be0.2CMR, Figure 3(e) red dot line) and E746-A750 del cells (12.6 \u00a1\u00be 3.2CMR, Figure 3(f) red dot line) than that in EGFR-transfected H1299 (5.7 \u00a1\u00be 0.4CMR, Figure 3(g) red dot line) and vector-transfected H1299 (6.6 \u00a1\u00be 0.3CMR, data not shown). The results of in vitro radiotracer uptake and washout studies of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA are summarized in Table 1. 3.4. In Vivo PET Imaging of Morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA Exhibits Differentials of Accumulation in NSCLC Tumors with Different EGFR Expressions. In vivo PET imaging was performed in 18 mice (6 per tumor pair) before and after treatment with Iressa. MicroPET images demonstrated that highest accumulation level of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA was observed in L858R tumor xenograft at 24 hours after radiotracer administration. The accumulation was 1.23-, 2.36-, and 3.08-folds higher than that of E746-A750 del, wild-type EGFR-transfected, and vector-transfected tumor xenograft in baseline group, respectively (Figures 4(a)?4(c), left panel, Figure 5). Pretreatment with Iressa (100mg/kg 1h before administration of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA) results in 53% and 38% decrease in the accumulation of radiotracer in L858R and E746-A750 del tumors, respectively (Figures 4(a)-4(b) right panels, Figure 5). There was a similar accumulation of radiotracer in wild-type EGFR-transfected and vector-transfected tumor xenografts before and after Iressa treatment (Figures 4(a)?4(c); Figure 5). The results of tumor-to-vector ratio at 24 hours after administration of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA was summarized in Table 5. 3.5. Biodistribution of Morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA Derivative in NSCLC Tumor-Bearing Mice. In the first hour, high % ID/g was observed in pancreas, kidney, stomach, lung, liver, and small and large intestines (Table 2). Four tumors expressing different levels of EGFR activity/expression had the peak radioactivity concentration in the first hour and then showed a gradual decrease over time; however, blood, heart, liver, and spleen showed a redistribution 24 hours after administration of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA. The levels of radioactivity in blood or heart rapidly dropped to 0.1~0.2% ID/g one hour after radiotracer injection and progressively decreased during 4 to 48 hours. We also observed a rapid excretion of radiotracer by liver. This pattern of hepatobiliary clearance was followed by a fast increased radioactivity in blood and liver and subsequent clearance by kidneys. All four tumor xenografts had similar accumulations of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA at the first hour after injection of radiotracer. The L858R tumor xenograft had a longer retention time of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA when compared to other 3 xenografts. Up to 24 hours after injection of radiotracer, the tumor-to-blood (TBR) and tumor-to-muscle concentration ratios (TMR) were not distinguishable among four tumor xenografts (Tables ?(Tables33 and ?and4;4; all other three cell lines were compared to L858R tumor cells at the same time point). The TBR and TMR in L858R tumor xenograft 24 hours after injection of radiotracer were 2.64 and 13.89, respectively (Tables ?(Tables33 and ?and4).4). The E746-A750 del tumor xenograft had similar TBR and TMR compared to those of L858R group. The L858R tumor xenograft also had a better tumor-to-vector ratio 24 hours after administration of radiotracer when compared to those of other 2 xenografts (Table 5). 4. Discussion. Predicting the expression of EGFR mutation through noninvasive PET imaging with a specific EGFR kinase radiotracer would provide an assessment for the NSCLC patients who may be benefit from EGFR inhibitors therapeutic regiment. Previously, our collaborator reported that the PET imaging with morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA, which could irreversibly and specifically bind to active form of EGFR kinase, allowed for identification of tumors with high EGFR kinase signaling activity (i.e., A431 highly expressing EGFR in NSCLC and U87 del EGFR cells expressing EGFRvIII mutants in brain gliomas) [28]. In the current study, by using morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA with PET, we demonstrated that L858R and E746-A750 del EGFR mutated cells, which are the most frequent mutation in NSCLC [9], showed significant increased accumulation of radiotracer when compared to the wild-type EGFR-transfected and vector-transfected cells in vitro and in vivo. The locations of the L858R missense mutations are shown within the activating loop of the tyrosine kinase, whereas the in-frame deletion, E746-A750 del, is present within another loop which flanks the ATP cleft [14]. Those mutations are predicted to alter the position of these amino acids relative to that of phosphorylation status of the cells and the sensitivity of inhibitor (i.e., gefitinib). The expression levels of phosphorylated EGFR in L858R and E746-A750 del EGFR mutated cells were similar, whereas wild-type EGFR-transfected cells showed the highest expression of total EGFR. Nevertheless, the mutation in active site of tyrosine kinase domain results in the enhanced EGFR signaling (phosphorylation status), which explains the increased accumulation of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA in L858R and E746-A750 del EGFR mutated cells. Similar interpretation can also be applied to the preferential accumulation and retention of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA in these mutant EGFR cells in in vivo PET imaging. In comparison with previous reports of EGFR imaging agents [22, 25, 26, 34, 35], the results of our in vivo PET imaging studies with morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA in mice bearing four tumor xenografts expressing different levels of phosphorylated EGFR are more selective. Predominant accumulations of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA in EGFR-expressing L858R and E746-A750 del carcinoma tumor xenografts reflect the high level of phosphorylated EGFR expression and activity in those tumor cells, which are known to be responsive to therapy with small molecular inhibitors of EGFR (e.g., Gefitinib) [14]. The H1299 EGFR tumor xenograft expressing EGFR represented a model of therapy-resistant tumors. H1299 EGFR tumor had lower morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA accumulation and produced similar images before and after treatment with EGFR inhibitor, Gefitinib (Iressa). Our results also provided more information of tissue distributions at later time points (24 and 48 hours after radiotracer administration). Selective accumulations of radiotracer in the L858R and E746-A750 del EGFR mutants were observed when compared to the tumors with wild-type EGFR or vector-transfected cells. Similar to the results from dynamic PET imaging obtained from 0 to 70 minutes after administration of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA [28], the biodistribution data obtained from 1, 4, 24, and 48 hours after administration of morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA showed a rapid clearance of radiotracer from blood and other major tissues such as heart, brain, liver, intestines, and kidney. The results demonstrated that the nonspecific binding of the radiotracer was washed out rapidly and caused increased tumor-to-background ratio due to the irreversible and selective bindings to active state of EGFR kinase. We also observed an unexpected high accumulation (3.2% ID/g at 24-hour time point) in pancreas at all time points. Mohammed et al. reported that gefitinib blocks EGFR signaling pathway in progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs) to PDAC in conditional LSL-Kras G12D/+ transgenic mice model [36]. Kelley and Ko reported a significant survival benefit with the addition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib to gemcitabine chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer [37]. These results demonstrated that morpholino-[ 131I]IPQA was entrapped in normal pancreatic cell (i.e., ductal cells and the islets of Langerhans) [38]. However, despite the lower lipophilicity of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA compared to previously reported EGFR imaging compounds such as the N-{4-[(4,5-dichloro-2-fluorophenyl)amino]quinazolin-6-yl}-acrylamide, 4-[(3,4-dichloro-6-fluorophenyl)amino]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline, and 4-(3-bromoanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline [22, 25, 26, 34, 35], the morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA still exhibited a significant hepatobiliary clearance. Also, high accumulation of the radiotracer in abdomen area over time would decrease the possibility of using this radiotracer for imaging primary site of NSCLC in animal model or for colorectal metastases. The further improvement could focus on the optimization of its pharmacokinetic properties by additional chemical derivatization (i.e., decrease lipophilicity and extraction by the liver, increase the half-life in plasma and accumulation amount/retention time in tumor tissue, and increase water solubility and renal clearance for a better background-to-target ratio). The relatively low resolution of microPET system (spatial resolution ~1.8mm) may not allow for assessing the heterogeneity of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA radioactivity accumulation. Therefore, micro-PET/CT and autoradiography (with 10?30\u00a5\u00ecM in plane resolution) are suitable to study the heterogeneity of morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA-derived radioactivity accumulation and to compare it with the immunohistochemically stained (adjacent) tissue sections for the total EGFR or phosphorylated EGFR (Tyrosine 1068). As a breakthrough of NSCLC treatment management in 2004, Lynch et al. [14] first reported that specific mutations in EGFR gene in NSCLC patients were correlated with clinical responsiveness to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. These findings were confirmed by Pao et al. in the tumor cells from the patients with L858R mutation but not for L747-S752 del EGFR mutant [14]. The study results from Sordella et al. also supported that EGF-independent autophosphorylation in these mutations caused high sensitivity to gefitinib and selectively activated downstream pathways [39]. Tracy et al. also proved that gefitinib-induced apoptosis in the L858R mutant lead dramatic response to gefitinib [40]. The authors also concluded that the affinity for the L858R mutant to gefitinib was 20-fold higher than that for wild type, which could be explained by its tighter binding to active conformation of the tyrosine kinase domain. Also, it could be expected to predict the efficacy in the treatment of the subgroup with gefitinib. Tracy et al. suggested that targeted agents developed to inhibit AKT pathway may be therapeutically more effective than those designed to inhibit the ERK 1/2 pathway in patients whose tumors contain EGFR L858R if the AKT pathway is consistently active [40]. Moreover, Brognard et al. reported that constitutive AKT activation has also been associated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation in NSCLC cell lines [41]. Further study could be the mono/combinations of chemotherapy with gefitinib or inhibitors of the AKT pathway which should be tested in vitro in cell lines and in vivo in tumor xenografts with EGFR L858R mutations to determine whether these may be additive or synergistic. In conclusion, an enhanced binding of morpholino-[ 124/131I]IPQA derivatives to the ATP binding site of mutant kinase of L858R or E746-A750 del EGFR mutant warrants that PET imaging with morpholino-[ 124I]IPQA has a potential for identification of tumors with high EGFR kinase activity in NSCLC and for the monitoring or selection of individual therapies with EGFR inhibitors. Further optimization of this class of radio compound would be necessary in order to lower lipophilicity and reduce hepatobiliary clearance. Conflict of Interests.

                "text": "The Conformational Control Inhibitor of Tyrosine Kinases DCC-2036 Is Effective for Imatinib-Resistant Cells Expressing T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1\tThe cells expressing the T674I point mutant of FIP1-like-1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1) in hypereosinophilics syndrome (HES) are resistant to imatinib and some second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). There is a desperate need to develop therapy to combat this acquired drug resistance. DCC-2036 has been synthesized as a third-generation TKI to combat especially the Bcr-Abl T315I mutant in chronic myeloid leukemia. This study evaluated the effect of DCC-2036 on FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1-positive cells, including the wild type (WT) and the T674I mutant. The in vitro effects of DCC-2036 on the PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 signal pathways, proliferation, cell cycling and apoptosis of FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1-positive cells were investigated, and a nude mouse xenograft model was employed to assess the in vivo antitumor activity. We found that DCC-2036 decreased the phosphorylated levels of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 and its downstream targets without apparent effects on total protein levels. DCC-2036 inhibited proliferation, and induced apoptosis with MEK-dependent up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim in FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1-positive cells. DCC-2036 also exhibited in vivo antineoplastic activity against cells with T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1. In summary, FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1-positive cells are sensitive to DCC-2036 regardless of their sensitivity to imatinib. DCC-2036 may be a potential compound to treat imatinib-resistant HES. Introduction. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) refers to the pathological presence of more than 1.5\u00a1\u00bf10 9/L of nonreactive eosinophils in peripheral blood lasting for more than 6 months with organ involvement [1]. According to WHO classification system, HES can be classified as molecularly characterized eosinophilic disorders, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-rearranged myeloid neoplasm, eosinophilia associated with phenotypically abnormal and/or clonal T lymphocytes, and chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) [2]. Several genetic abnormalities such as PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1, PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 or FGFR1 have been observed in PDGFR-rearranged myeloid neoplasm [3], and the FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 fusion gene generated by the interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 has been reported to account for 5% to 15% [4]. The expression of FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 can promote activation of pro-survival signal pathways, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells [5], [6]. FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 is sensitive to imatinib treatment and patients with HES can be successfully treated with imatinib (100 mg/day) [7]. However, the secondary mutation T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 in its kinase domain has been found in imatinib-refractory HES or CEL. T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1, analogous to T315I Bcr-Abl in CML, is also resistant to the second-generation TKIs, such as nilotinib [8]. Novel agents for imatinib-resistant HES are needed. DCC-2036, a conformational control inhibitor of ABL1, showed remarkable efficacy in murine bone marrow transplantation model of Bcr-Abl T315I CML [9] and potently suppressed the T315I Bcr-Abl in primary patient cells in vitro and in vivo [10]. Besides, DCC-2036 exhibited high selective activity for FLT3, TIE2 and SRC-family kinases [10]. Given the significant effect of DCC-2036 on Bcr-Abl T315I CML, we herein evaluated the efficacy of DCC-2036 against the FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1-expressing cells, including EOL-1 cell line and BaF3 cell lines harboring the WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1, to examine DCC-2036 as a strategy to overcome the drug-resistance of HES. Materials and Methods. Reagents. DCC-2036 was purchased from Selleck (Houston, TX, USA), sorafenib and imatinib were from Alexis Biochemicals (Plymouth Meeting, PA). They were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a final concentration of 20 mmol/L (mM) and stored in aliquots at?20\u00a1\u00c6C. Antibodies against PARP, Bcl-2, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and cytochrome c (clone 6H2.B4) were obtained from BD Biosciences Pharmingen (San Jose, CA, USA); antibodies against phospho-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 (Y1018), phospho-Erk1/2 (T202/Y204), Erk 1/2, phospho-Akt (S473), total Akt, Bax, caspase-3, phospho-Bim (S69) and the MEK inhibitor U0126 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); antibodies against phospho-STAT3 (Y705), total STAT3, total PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 were products of Upstate Technology; antibodies against Mcl-1 (S19), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and Bax were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA); antibodies against Bim were obtained from Stressgen Bioreagents (Columbia, Canada); antibodies against Survivin were purchased from Novus Biotechnology (Littleton, CO, USA); cycloheximide (CHX) and antibodies against Actin, active-caspase3 were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and MG132 was bought from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibodies were obtained from Pierce Biotechnology (Los Angeles, CA, USA) [11], [12]; the plasmid Bim-EL was from Origene (Rockville, MD, USA); His-ubiquitin (His-Ub) plasmid was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); Ni?nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) agarose beads were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Cell culture. EOL-1 cell line harboring the FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 fusion oncogene and BaF3 cells carrying WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 (BaF3-WT or BaF3-T674I) were described previously [13], [14]. EOL-1 cells and BaF3 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen, Guangzhou, China), added with 10% fetal calf serum (Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and in water vapor-saturated air with 5% CO 2. Cell viability assay. Viable cells were quantified by MTS assay (Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution reagent; Promega, Madison, WI) as previously described [11], [12]. 100 \u00a5\u00ecL BaF3 cells or EOL-1 cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates (2\u00a1\u00bf10 4 cells per well) and then cultured with various concentrations of DCC-2036 for 72 hours. Twenty \u00a5\u00ecL MTS solution per well was added 4 hours before culture termination. The absorbance was read on a 96-well plate reader at wavelength 490 nm. The drug concentration resulting in 50% decrease in the number of live cells (IC 50) was determined. Immunoblotting analysis. Cells were incubated with different concentrations of DCC-2036 for indicated durations, washed, and then harvested by preparing whole lysates in RIPA buffer (1\u00a1\u00bfPBS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) supplemented with freshly added 10 mM \u00a5\u00e2-glycerophosphare, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1\u00a1\u00bfRoche complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail) (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) [12], [15]. As for AIF and cytochrome c release detection, the cytosolic fraction was prepared in digitonin extraction buffer [1 mM PIPES (pH 6.8), 300 mM sucrose, 0.015% (wt/vol) digitonin, 3 mM MgCl 2, 5 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM PMSF] [12], [15], [16]. The concentration of protein was measured in a modified Lowry method at 750 nm wavelength (protein assay, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Proteins were resolved by molecular size by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. Proteins were probed with the corresponding antibodies described above and chemiluminescence was used to detect the change of protein level with standard immunoblotting procedures according to the Manufacturer's instruction [17]. Apoptosis assay by flow cytometry. After DCC-2036 treatment, cells were collected, washed with 1\u00a1\u00bf Binding buffer, and then stained for about 20 minutes with Annexin V-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) for EOL-1 cells or Annexin V-PE (phycoerythrin) for BaF3 cells expressing WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1. Propidium iodide (PI) or 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) was added before flow cytometric analysis depending on the fluorophore attached to Annexin V. Apoptosis was assessed with the FACS Calibur flow cytometer and CellQuest Pro software (Becton Dickinson) as previously described [11], [12]. Cell-cycle analysis by flow cytometry. After drug treatment, cells were harvested, fixed in 75% alcohol, and stained with propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour in dark according to manufacturer's guildance. Cell-cycle distribution was analyzed with FACS Calibur flow cytometer with CellQuest Pro software as described [11], [12]. Clonogenicity assay. BaF3-WT and BaF3-T674I cells (2\u00a1\u00bf10 5/mL) were exposed to indicated concentrations of DCC-2036 (DMSO for control) for 36 hours, then cells were collected, washed with 1\u00a1\u00bf PBS, then cultured in methylcellulose media (Cat#03231; Stem Cell Technology). Absent of drug administration, after 7 days incubation at 37\u00a1\u00c6C, colonies with more than 50 cells were counted under an inverted phase-contrast microscope. The capability of colony formation was assessed. siRNA transfection. The siRNA against human Bim and non-targeting siRNAs (Mock siRNA as control) were purchased from Dharmacon RNA technology (Blenheim, England). Bim siRNA or Mock siRNA was transfected into the EOL-1 cells; then cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of DCC-2036 for 24 hours. Cell death and related protein levels were detected. The Cell Line Nucleofector Kit T involved was from Amaxa technology (Guangzhou, China), and Program O-17 was chosen according to the manufacturer's instructions [18]. In vivo ubiquitination assay. The in vivo ubiquitination assay was carried out as previously described [19], [20]. In brief, BaF3 cells expressing T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 hours and then treated with or without DCC-2036 at 400 nM for 8 hours. Then the cells were lysed by a denaturing buffer (6 M guanidine-HCl, 0.1 M Na 2HPO 4/NaH 2PO 4, 10 mM imidazole), followed by nickel bead purification and immunoblot analysis. The ubiquitinated BimEL was quantified by densitometry using Image J. Nude mouse xenograft model. Nude nu/nu BALB/c mice (Slaccas Company, Shanghai, China) were housed in barrier facilities at the animal center of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. The mice were bred in a 12-hour light-dark cycle environment with food and water available ad libitum. 9\u00a1\u00bf10 6 of BaF3 cells harboring the T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 resuspended in Matrigel (Becton-Dickson Biosciences Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) were inoculated subcutaneously on the flank of the mice, which were about 4\u00a1\u00ad6 weeks old [21]. When tumors were palpable (\u00a1\u00ad100 mm 3), the mice were divided at random into two groups. One group received vehicle as control (0.5% Carboxymethylcellulose/1% Tween-80), the other group received DCC-2036 (200 mg/kg, daily, oral gavage) dissolved in 0.5% Carboxymethylcellulose/1% Tween-80. The tumors were calculated with calipers every other day, and the tumor volumes were measured by the following formula: a 2\u00a1\u00bfb\u00a1\u00bf0.4, where a is the smallest diameter and b is the diameter perpendicular to a. Other indicators of general health, such as body weight, feeding behavior, and motor activity of each animal were also monitored. After administration of drug or vehicle for about two weeks, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumor xenografts were immediately dissected, weighted, stored and fixed. Ethics Statement. This study was conducted based on the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Animal studies were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-sen University (Protocol Number: 2012?0403). Sodium pentobarbital anesthesia methods and other efforts were taken to minimize animal suffering. Immunohistochemical staining. Tumor xenografts were fixed in formalin, then embedded in paraffin and sectioned, and maxVision Kit (Maixin Bio) was used to immunostain the xenograft sections (4 \u00a5\u00ecm). After incubation with the primary antibody of rabbit anti-Ki67 [21], each slide was applied with about 50 \u00a5\u00ecL maxVision reagent, followed by 0.05% diaminobenzidine and 0.03% H 2O 2 in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCL (pH 7.6) to develop the color; then the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. A negative control for Ki67 was developed for each xenograft specimen by replacing rabbit anti-Ki67 with pre-immune rabbit serum. Statistical analysis. All experiments were carried out at least three times, and data are expressed in the form of mean \u00a1\u00be standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise stated. Statistical analysis was conducted with GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Two-tailed Student's t test was employed to compare the data between two groups, while One-Way ANOVA with post hoc intergroup comparison by Tukey test was for comparing more than two groups. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results. DCC-2036 decreases the levels of phosphorylated-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 and its downstream signaling. EOL-1 cell line, derived from a patient with FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1-positive HES [14] and BaF3 cells expressing wild-type or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 were employed in the study. EOL-1 cells exhibited a higher sensitivity to DCC-2036. Exposure to 6 nM DCC-2036 for 24 hours completely abolished the phosphorylation of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 in EOL-1 cells. Because the FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 T674I mutant in HES mainly contributes to the imatinib-resistance [22], [23], we explored whether DCC-2036 could inhibit PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 in FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1-positive cells regardless of the mutational status. DCC-2036 effectively decreased the phosphorylated-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 in BaF3 cells expressing FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 T674I mutant in a concentration- and time-dependent manner while the total protein level of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 was not affected (Figure 1A & B). Similar results were observed in BaF3 cells expressing WT FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1. Next, we measured the phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 in the three cell lines. In concordance with our previous finding, the phosphorylated levels of downstream signaling molecules such as the STAT3, Erk1/2, and Akt were all decreased by DCC-2036, without apparent impact on total protein levels (Figure 1A & B). Therefore, DCC-2036 inhibited the activation of phosphorylated-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 and its downstream signaling molecules in FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1-positive cells despite of the mutational status of FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1. Because tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib was effective for imatinib-resistant FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 T674I mutation cells [23], we also compared the inhibitory effect of DCC-2036 with sorafenib in the BaF3-T674I cells. We found that DCC-2036 decreased the phosphorylated-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 with lower concentrations than sorafenib, indicating that DCC-2036 might be more potent (Figure 1C). DCC-2036 inhibits the proliferation of EOL-1 cells and BaF3 cells harboring wild-type or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1. To evaluate the inhibitory effect of DCC-2036 on cell proliferation, EOL-1 cells and BaF3 cells were treated with different concentrations of DCC-2036 for 72 hours, and then cell viability was measured with the MTS assay. DCC-2036 potently decreased the cell viability of EOL-1, BaF3 cells expressing WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 (IC 50=0.8 nM, 32.2 nM and 40.3 nM, respectively, Figure 2A). Sorafenib also decreased the cell viability of BaF3 cells expressing T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 but with a slightly higher IC 50 (IC 50=89.0 nM, Figure 2A), which again suggested that might be more effective than sorafenib in the FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 T674I mutation cells. In addition, we carried out the colony-formation experiment to evaluate the effect of DCC-2036 on the anchorage-independent growth of BaF3 cell lines. BaF3 cells expressing WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 were co-cultured with indicated concentrations of DCC-2036 for 36 hours, then cells were seeded in methylcellulose without DCC-2036. The colony-forming capability was assessed according to the number of colonies. The colony-forming capabilities of both cell lines were inhibited by DCC-2036 in concentration-dependent manners (Figure 2B). Therefore, DCC-2036 actively suppressed the growth and proliferation of cells expressing WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1. DCC-2036 increases sub-G 1 population in FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1-expressing cells. We next explored whether the cell cycle was affected by DCC-2036 administration. EOL-1, BaF3 cells expressing WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 were treated with indicated concentrations of DCC-2036 for different durations (24 h for EOL-1 cells and 36 h for BaF3 cells), and their DNA contents were analyzed with PI, a DNA-intercalating dye. All three cell lines had an increased sub-G 1 apoptotic population but no apparent alteration in cell-cycle phase distribution compared with control (Figure 3). DCC-2036 results in apoptosis of cells expressing WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1. To demonstrate the effect of DCC-2036 on apoptosis of FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1?expressing HES cells, cells were incubated with various concentrations of DCC-2036 for indicated durations (24 h for EOL-1 cells, 36 h for BaF3 cells), then stained with Annexin V/PI (EOL-1 cells) or Annexin V-PE/7-AAD (BaF3 cells) to assess cell apoptosis. DCC-2036 induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure 4, Figure S1A and S1B). Treatment of 6 nM DCC-2036 for 24 hours led to \u00a1\u00ad40% cell death of EOL-1 (Figure 4), while the apoptosis of BaF3 cells expressing WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 after treatment with 400 nmol/L DCC-2036 for 36 hours reached \u00a1\u00ad40% and \u00a1\u00ad80%, respectively, suggesting that BaF3-T674I cells were more sensitive to DCC-2036 than imatinib (Figure 4). Immunoblotting revealed that the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, hallmarks of apoptosis, was increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and were concurrent with the decline of PARP (116 kDa) and pro-caspase-3 (32 kDa) (Figure 5A). We observed no apparent change in other apoptosis-related proteins such as XIAP, Survivin, Bax, and Mcl-1, but there was an overt increase in Bim-EL protein level in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure 5B and Figure S1C). Moreover, the release of AIF and cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, has been considered an indicator of cell apoptosis in the early phase [15], [24], [25]. Western blot exhibited a substantial release of AIF and cytochrome c into cytosol in both EOL-1 cells and BaF3 cells expressing WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 time-dependently (Figure 5C). These data may infer that DCC-2036 induced apoptosis in HES cells through the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. Elevated Bim-EL is essential for apoptosis induced by DCC-2036. It has been reported that Bim was critical for erlotinib-induced apoptosis in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells [26] and imatinib-induced apoptosis in KIT dependent GIST cells [27]. We investigated whether up-regulation of Bim (Figure 5B) was critical for DCC-2036-induced-apoptosis in HES cells. We transfected EOL-1 cells with Bim siRNA duplexes to silence the expression of Bim, or Mock siRNA as control, then EOL-1 cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of DCC-2036 for 24 hours. Apoptosis was evaluated by immunoblotting of PARP and by counting live cells with trypan blue dye exclusion. As shown in Figure 6A, knockdown of Bim remarkably attenuated apoptosis mediated by DCC-2036 in EOL cells, suggesting that Bim might be a critical mediator in DCC-2036-induced apoptosis in HES. Of note, Bim-extra long (EL) but not Bim-long (L) or Bim-short (S) is the primary isoform detected in these cells [28], we thus turned our attention to Bim-EL isoform in subsequent experiments. DCC-2036 mediates Bim-EL up-regulation by inhibiting its degradation. Given the critical role of Bim-EL, we further explored the potential mechanism that DCC-2036 induced Bim-EL up-regulation. The mRNA level of Bim showed no significant change by qRT-PCR (data not shown), which suggested that DCC-2036 might increase Bim-EL at posttranscriptional levels. We examined whether the turnover rate of Bim-EL protein was affected by DCC-2036. BaF3 cells harboring WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 were treated with or without 400 nM DCC-2036 for 2 hours, then 100 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL cycloheximide (CHX), a translation inihibitor, was added, and then cells were harvested at the indicated time point, immunoblotting showed that the turnover of Bim-EL was decelerated compared with cells absent of DCC-2036 treatment (Figure 6B), suggesting that DCC-2036 may increase Bim-EL protein level by reducing its turnover rate. Next, we investigated whether the proteasome pathway was involved in the degradation of Bim-EL protein. BaF3-T674I cells were pre-treated with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM MG132 for 2 hours, then incubated with 400 nM DCC-2036 for 12 hours. Western blotting analysis revealed that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 led to increased expression of Bim-EL and there was no difference in the Bim-EL protein level between the MG132 treatment alone and combination of MG132 and DCC-2036 (Figure 6C), indicating that the up-regulation of Bim-EL depended on the proteasome pathway. It has been reported that Bim could be regulated by MEK-ERK or PI3K-Akt pathway [29], [30], [31]. Our data showed that both pathways were inhibited by DCC-2036, so we further explored which pathway was predominantly responsible for up-regulation of Bim-EL mediated by DCC-2036. EOL-1 cells were exposed to U0126 (a MEK inhibitor), LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor), DCC-2036 or combination of them respectively. Western blot analysis revealed that DCC-2036 or U0126 alone induced up-regulation of Bim-EL. In contrast, EOL-1 cells treated with LY294002 did not exhibit any remarkable increase in Bim-EL protein level. Furthermore, combination of the two or three compounds didn't display additive effects on up-regulation of Bim-EL compared with U0126 treatment alone. All these data supported that DCC-2036 increased Bim-EL protein level predominantly through MEK-ERK pathway (Figure 6D). Erk1/2 can phosphorylate Bim-EL at serine69 (Ser69) eliciting a rapid polyubiquitination and proteosomal degradation [31]. In our study, we observed the protein level of phospho-Bim-EL (Ser69) declined significantly with DCC-2036 treatment of EOL-1 cells (Figure 5B and Figure S1C), which was consistent with declined phospho-Erk1/2 resulted from decreased phospho-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 by DCC-2036 (Figure 1A and 1B). Moreover, we found that polyubiquitinated Bim-EL decreased with treatment of DCC-2036 for 8 hours by ubiquitination assay in intact cells (Figure 6E), which suggested that the total Bim-EL in cells was increased. DCC-2036 suppresses the growth of xenografted BaF3 cells harboring FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 T674I mutant in nude mice. To assess the in vivo effect of DCC-2036, we subcutaneously inoculated BaF3 cells expressing FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 T674I mutant in nude mice. When tumor xenografs were palpable (\u00a1\u00ad100 mm 3), nude mice were randomized to receive vehicle (0.5% CMC/1% Tween 80, n=6) or DCC-2036 (200 mg/kg in 0.5% CMC/1% Tween 80, once daily, oral gavage, n=7) for about 2 weeks. The growth curve vs time of BaF3-T674I tumors was apparently inhibited by the administration of DCC-2036 compared with the control group (Figure 7A). In addition, the tumor volumes and tumor weights in the drug-treated group were remarkably lower than the control group (Figure 7B). The motor activity, feeding behavior and body weight of the control group and experiment group were all normal (data not shown). Furthermore, Western blotting analysis of these BaF3-T674I xenograft tissues from mice exhibited downregulation of phosphorylated-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 and its downstream signaling molecules, along with up-regulation of Bim-EL (Figure 7C), which indicated DCC-2036 inhibited the activity of T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis with Ki67 (to measure cell proliferation) staining showed that DCC-2036 suppressed the proliferation of BaF3 cells harboring FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 T674I mutant in vivo (Figure 7D). To conclude, all these data supported that DCC-2036 had a beneficial antineoplastic effect in vivo in spite of the T674I-FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 mutation status. Discussion. Targeted therapy to inhibit the oncogene FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 has met with some success: the first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib has been reported to be effective to HES, but imatinib-resistant mutations emerged. Several mutations in the kinase domains such as D842V [32], T674I [33], S601P and L629P [34], have been demonstrated to be responsible for the drug-resistance. Of note, the \u00a1\u00b0gate-keeper\u00a1\u00b1 mutant T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 in HES, similar to T315I Bcr-Abl in CML, was also refractory to some second-generation TKIs, such as nilotinib, sorafenib [8]. Thus, it is really a challenge to overcome the acquired drug resistance. Combination therapy with more than one compound or other novel TKIs is advised. Imatinib combined with vinorelbine have been reported to enhance breast cancer cell growth inhibition via PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 signaling [35]. Imatinib and farnesyltransferase inhibitors combination were used to treat Bcr-Abl-positive CML cells [36]. These examples inferred that combination therapy with compounds is feasible. Meantime, the third-generation TKIs (AP24534, HG-7-85-1, DCC-2036) have been developed [10], [37], [38], but their efficacy and safety still need to be further validated in clinical trials. In this study, we mainly explored the effect of the novel TKI DCC-2036 on HES. DCC-2036, a third-generation TKI, was rationally designed to specifically target the Bcr-Abl T315I mutant in CML by functioning as a conformational control inhibitor. The inhibition of kinase activity by DCC-2036 on unphosphorylated-Abl, phosphorylated-Abl, unphosphorylated-Abl T315I mutant and phosphorylated-Abl T315I mutant has been demonstrated (IC 50 values were 0.75\u00a1\u00be0.11, 2\u00a1\u00be1, 5\u00a1\u00be1 and 4\u00a1\u00be1 nM, respectively) [10]. In addition, DCC-2036 also inhibited the Src family kinases (Src, Lyn, FGR and HCK) and the receptor TKs, such as KDR, FLT3 and TIE2 [10]. Notably, the inhibition of kinase activity by DCC-2036 on PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 and PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2 was observed (IC 50 values were 70\u00a1\u00be10 nM and 113\u00a1\u00be10 nM, respectively) [10]. Based on the broad and notable effect of DCC-2036 on significant kinases, we evaluated the effect of DCC-2036 on WT or T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 positive cells of HES in vitro and in vivo. Firstly, we found that DCC-2036 remarkably decreased the phosphorylation level of PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 and its downstream signaling molecules such as phosphorylated-Erk1/2, phosphorylated-Akt and phosphorylated-STAT3 without any influence on the total level of these proteins. Secondly, DCC-2036 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis with the increased cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 in a concentration- and time-depended manner in HES cells. In addition, cytochrome c and AIF released from the mitochondrion into the endochylema were also increased. Data reflected that the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway was involved. Flow cytometry also reflected increased apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner and increased sub-G1 apoptotic population. Thirdly, DCC-2036-mediated apoptosis of FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 positive cells depended on the up-regulation of Bim-EL, as other apoptosis-related proteins such as XIAP, Survivin, Bax, and Mcl-1 were not apparently influenced by DCC-2036 treatment, while Bim-EL protein level was obviously elevated. Moreover, knockdown of Bim by siRNA could attenuate the DCC-2036-mediated apoptosis in HES cells. Fourthly, DCC-2036 reduced the turnover rate of Bim-EL for decelerated degradation of Bim-EL, which depended on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway after Bim-EL was phosphorylated at Ser69 by Erk1/2. Finally, our nude mouse model demonstrated that DCC-2036 had a good anti-tumor activity in vivo. To conclude, our data demonstrate that DCC-2036 has potent activity against FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 positive HES cells regardless of the T674 mutation status in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, inhibitory effect of DCC-2036 was comparable to sorafenib in the FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 T674I mutation cells. In this study, we have also shown for the first time that Bim is essential for DCC-2036-mediated apoptosis in FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1 positive cells. Taken together, DCC-2036 may be a promising agent for treating FIP1L1-PDGFR\u00a5\u00e1-positive HES which is resistant to imatinib. Supporting Information. Figure S1.

                "text": "Pak and Rac GTPases promote oncogenic KIT?induced neoplasms\tAn acquired somatic mutation at codon 816 in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase is associated with poor prognosis in patients with systemic mastocytosis and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Treatment of leukemic cells bearing this mutation with an allosteric inhibitor of p21?activated kinase (Pak) or its genetic inactivation results in growth repression due to enhanced apoptosis. Inhibition of the upstream effector Rac abrogates the oncogene-induced growth and activity of Pak. Although both Rac1 and Rac2 are constitutively activated via the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Vav1, loss of Rac1 or Rac2 alone moderately corrected the growth of KIT-bearing leukemic cells, whereas the combined loss resulted in 75% growth repression. In vivo, the inhibition of Vav or Rac or Pak delayed the onset of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and corrected the associated pathology in mice. To assess the role of Rac GEFs in oncogene-induced transformation, we used an inhibitor of Rac, EHop-016, which specifically targets Vav1 and found that EHop-016 was a potent inhibitor of human and murine leukemic cell growth. These studies identify Pak and Rac GTPases, including Vav1, as potential therapeutic targets in MPN and AML involving an oncogenic form of KIT. Introduction. Gain-of-function mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase are associated with highly malignant human neoplasms. In particular, an acquired somatic mutation at codon 816 in KIT involving an aspartic acid to valine substitution is found in approximately 90% of patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) and in approximately 40% of patients with core?binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (1?3). The presence of this mutation in SM and AML is associated with poor prognosis and overall survival. In mice, the expression of this mutation is sufficient to recapitulate several cardinal features of human SM (4). This mutation changes the conformation of the KIT receptor, resulting in altered substrate recognition and constitutive tyrosine autophosphorylation, which leads to a constitutive ligand-independent growth (5?7) that is resistant to imatinib and shows little therapeutic efficacy in response to dasatinib in most SM patients (8, 9). As there are currently no efficacious therapeutic agents against this mutation, we sought to define novel therapeutic targets that might contribute to aberrant signaling downstream from this mutant and which in turn might contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC/Ps) in diseases such as AML and SM. Previously, we and others have shown that p85\u00a5\u00e1, the regulatory subunit of class IA PI3 kinase (PI3K), is required for KITD814V-induced (murine homolog) transformation (10, 11). Although p85\u00a5\u00e1 is a difficult protein to target therapeutically, we hypothesized that perhaps the downstream effectors of the PI3K signaling pathway, in particular guanine exchange factors (GEFs) such as Vav1, Tiam1, and Trio, as well as their downstream targets including the Rho family GTPases Rac1 and Rac2 and p21?activated kinase (Pak), might contribute to gain-of-function mutant KIT?mediated transformation. Expression of the GEF Vav1 is predominantly restricted to the hematopoietic compartment (12). Vav1 consists of multiple domains including a calponin homology domain, a Dbl homology domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a cysteine-rich region, as well as an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain flanked by two SH3 domains (13). Interestingly, deletion of the N-terminal region of Vav1 alone renders this protein oncogenic (12). Although Vav has been shown to play an important role in regulating T and B cell signaling and neutrophil functions (14, 15), its role in leukemogenesis, particularly in oncogenic KIT?induced myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), is unknown. Furthermore, in the context of an oncogene such as KITD814V, it is unclear to what extent Vav1 regulates the activation of Rac (Rac1 and Rac2) GTPases and to what extent Rac1 and Rac2 contribute to transformation either alone or via downstream substrates such as Pak. Rac GTPases cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. Rac2 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, whereas Rac1 is ubiquitously expressed (16). Although the role of Rac1 and Rac2 in normal hematopoiesis has been well documented (16), how these GTPases contribute to oncogenic KIT?induced (KITD814V-induced) transformation is poorly understood. A small-molecule antagonist of Rac, NSC23766 has been described (17). NSC23766 inhibits the activation of Rac by interfering with the binding of GEFs Tiam1 and Trio (17). More recently, Ortiz et al. described a novel Rac inhibitor, EHop-016, which is derived on the basis of the structure of NSC23766 and inhibits the activation of Rac with a substantially lower IC 50 compared with NSC23766 (18). How these two drugs impact the relative growth of KITD814V-bearing cells and whether they equally inhibit the activation of Rac1 versus Rac2 in these cells has never been explored. Paks are serine/threonine kinases (19, 20). As a major downstream effector of Rac, Paks play an essential role in regulating both growth and actin-based functions (21?23). Of the three isoforms that belong to the group I family, Pak1 is the most well-characterized member and is ubiquitously expressed (19). Pak1 expression is upregulated in several solid tumors including those in ovarian, breast, and bladder cancers (24?26). While Pak has been shown to function as a potential downstream target of Rac, its relative contribution to MPNs or AML has not been explored. Here, we show that KITD814V-bearing (mouse) and KITD816V-bearing (human) leukemic cells exhibit constitutive activation of Pak, Rac GTPases, and the GEF Vav1. In a series of experiments using knockout mouse models, mouse models of MPN, dominant-negative approaches, an allosteric inhibitor of Pak, and a novel small-molecule inhibitor of Rac, we provide evidence of a mechanism of KITD814V-induced transformation and potentially novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of oncogenic KIT?bearing neoplasms. Results. The GEF Vav1 regulates ligand-independent growth and Rac1 and Rac2 activation in oncogene KIT?bearing (KITD814V-bearing) cells.. The role of hematopoietic-specific GEF and its downstream substrates including Rac1 and/or Rac2 and Pak in KITD814V-induced transformation is not known. To assess whether KITD814V-bearing cells activate the GEF Vav1, we transduced 32D myeloid cells lacking the expression of the endogenous KIT receptor with a bicistronic retrovirus encoding either a WT version of KIT or an oncogenic version (KITD814V) (27). Transduced cells were sorted to homogeneity on the basis of EGFP expression and used in the experiments described here. As seen in Figure ?Figure1A,1A, transduced cells bearing KITD814V following 8 hours of serum and growth factor deprivation demonstrated constitutive phosphorylation of Vav1 relative to WT KIT?expressing cells. To assess the functional significance of constitutive Vav1 phosphorylation in KITD814V-bearing primary HSC/Ps, we transduced low-density BM cells derived from WT or Vav1 ?/? mice with EGFP-expressing WT KIT or KITD814V retrovirus. Primary BM cells transduced at similar efficiency were sorted to homogeneity on the basis of EGFP expression and subjected to ligand-independent (in the absence of stem cell factor) growth. As expected and previously shown (27 ), KITD814V-expressing HSC/Ps showed a significant increase in ligand-independent growth compared with WT KIT?bearing cells, however, lack of Vav1 in these cells resulted in approximately 75% repression of ligand-independent growth (Figure ?(Figure1B).1B). Loss of Vav2 or Vav3 in primary HSC/Ps did not profoundly impact the ligand-independent growth of KITD814V-bearing cells (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; doi: 10.1172/JCI67509DS1). To assess how Vav1 might contribute to KITD814V-induced ligand-independent growth, we determined the activation status of downstream substrates of Vav1, the Rac family GTPases (16, 28). We examined the activation of both Rac1 and Rac2 in Vav1-deficient KITD814V-bearing HSC/Ps. Figure ?Figure1C1C shows the constitutive activation of both Rac1 and Rac2 in KITD814V-bearing WT HSC/Ps. In contrast, the activation of both Rac1 and Rac2 was reduced in KITD814V-bearing Vav1 ?/? HSC/Ps. These results suggest that Vav1 regulates Rac1 and Rac2 activation to a similar extent in KITD814V-bearing cells and that deficiency of Vav1 in KITD814V-bearing cells significantly reduces the ligand-independent growth normally associated with these cells. While these results suggest a role for Vav1 in Rac activation and perhaps in KITD814V-induced transformation, its direct involvement can only be established by inhibiting the activation of Rac in these cells. To test this, we infected KITD814V-bearing 32D myeloid cells with a dominant-negative version of Rac (RacN17). A bicistronic retrovirus encoding WT KIT or KITD814V along with a human CD4 antigen as a selectable marker was used for these studies (Figure ?(Figure2A).2A). RacN17 was cloned into an EGFP-enconding retrovirus (for selection of transduced cells). 32D myeloid cells were coinfected with virus encoding WT KIT or KITD814V and/or RacN17. Cells were sorted on the basis of hCD4 and/or EGFP expression (Figure ?(Figure2A).2A). Single- or double-positive sorted cells were subjected to a proliferation assay. As seen in Figure ?Figure2B,2B, the expression of a dominant-negative version of Rac (RacN17) in KITD814V-bearing cells significantly repressed ligand-independent growth relative to controls. The reduction in the growth of KITD814V- and RacN17-coexpressing cells was in part due to reduced survival relative to controls (Figure ?(Figure2C).2C). IL-3 responses in all of these cell types, including in KITD814V- and RacN17-coexpressing cells, were comparable (Figure ?(Figure2B).2B). The reduction in the growth and survival of KITD814V- and RacN17-coexpressing cells was due to the direct repression of Rac1 and Rac2 (Figure ?(Figure2D).2D). Taken together, these results suggest that downstream from Vav1, Rac1 and Rac2 likely play an essential role in regulating KITD814V-induced transformation. To test this in more detail, we performed transplant studies by injecting myeloid cells coexpressing KITD814V and RacN17 along with control cells into C3H/HeJ syngeneic mice (27). Transplanted mice were observed for the development of MPNs and survival relative to controls. Mice transplanted with cells coexpressing KITD814V and RacN17 demonstrated a significantly prolonged lifespan relative to the KITD814V-only?expressing mice (Figure ?(Figure3A).3A). To assess the impact of Rac repression on MPN development, a cohort of KITD814V- and RacN17-coexpressing mice were analyzed in detail at the same time as when the KITD814V-only?bearing mice first began to succumb. As seen in Figure ?Figure3B,3B, KITD814V-bearing mice showed peripheral blood (PB) counts in the range of 150 K/\u00a5\u00ecl. In contrast, mice transplanted with cells coexpressing KITD814V and RacN17 demonstrated a profound reduction in PB wbc and neutrophil (NE) counts. Additional analysis was conducted on KITD814V- and RacN17-coexpressing mice when the KITD814V-only mice began to succumb. In other words, KITD814V- and RacN17-bearing mice were sacrificed at the same time as the moribund KITD814V mice to assess disease progression and the impact of Rac repression on MPNs. Around the time of death, up to 90% of the leukemic cells were detected in the PB, BM, and spleen of mice transplanted with cells bearing KITD814V alone (Supplemental Figure 2A). In contrast, mice transplanted with cells coexpressing KITD814V and RacN17 demonstrated only approximately 20% leukemic cells as determined by EGFP positivity in all three tissues examined. The left panel of Supplemental Figure 2A shows a quantitative assessment of the presence of EGFP-expressing cells in PB, BM, and spleen, and the right panel shows representative flow cytometric blots demonstrating the percentage of EGFP expression in various tissues in the indicated genotypes. Supplemental Figure 2B demonstrates a quantitative reduction in the spleen weight of mice transplanted with cells coexpressing KITD814V and RacN17 relative to mice transplanted with cells bearing the KITD814V mutation alone. The right panel depicts representative spleens derived from KITD814V-bearing mice as well as mice coexpressing KITD814V and RacN17. Importantly, while gross lung lesions were observed in mice transplanted with cells bearing KITD814V alone, these lesions were nearly absent in the lungs of transplanted mice coexpressing KITD814V and RacN17 (Supplemental Figure 2C). Histopathological analysis revealed that while massive myeloid cell infiltration was observed in mice transplanted with KITD814V-bearing cells in spleen and lungs, mice bearing cells coexpressing KITD814V and RacN17 showed markedly less infiltration of these cells, and the splenic architecture in these mice was indistinguishable from the control mice (Figure ?(Figure3,3, C and D). To assess whether the enhanced survival of mice, the reduced infiltration of myeloid blasts in various tissues including lung and liver, and the lack of destruction of the splenic architecture observed in mice transplanted with cells coexpressing KITD814V and RacN17 were due to reduced Rac activation, we examined the activation status of Rac1 and Rac2 in splenocytes. Cellular lysates from spleens of KITD814V-bearing mice were harvested at moribundity. At the same time, splenic lysates were derived from mice transplanted with cells coexpressing KITD814V and RacN17, designated as time point matched and moribund, respectively. As seen in Figure ?Figure3E,3E, mice transplanted with cells coexpressing RacN17 and KITD814V showed marked repression in both Rac1 and Rac2 activation compared with controls. In addition to Rac repression, a substantial repression in the activation of Pak, a downstream substrate of Rac, was also observed (Supplemental Figure 3). These results suggest that expression of RacN17 in KITD814V-bearing cells likely inhibits their growth in vivo by inhibiting the activation of Rac1 and Rac2, resulting in prolonged survival and delayed MPN development. Growth of oncogenic KIT-bearing (KITD814V in mouse and KITD816V in humans) murine and human mastocytosis patient?derived cells is inhibited by a novel Rac inhibitor, EHop-016.. Based on the observation that Rac inhibition in vivo delays KITD814V-driven MPN, we hypothesized that pharmacologic inhibition of Rac might inhibit KITD814V-induced proliferation in vitro. For these studies, we first used the well-characterized Rac inhibitor NSC23766 (17). NSC23766 inhibits Rac binding and activation by the Rac-specific GEFs Trio and Tiam1 (17). Treatment of myeloid cells bearing the WT KIT or KITD814V receptor with NSC23766 demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in the hyperproliferation of KITD814V-bearing cells but not of WT KIT?bearing cells (Supplemental Figure 4A). Treatment of the murine mastocytoma cell line P815, which bears the activating KITD814V mutation, as well as treatment of AML patient?derived Kasumi-1 cells, which express the KITD816V mutation, consistently demonstrated dose-dependent growth repression in the presence of NSC23766 (Supplemental Figure 4, B and C). While dose-dependent growth inhibition of oncogene KIT?bearing cells in the presence of NSC23766 was observed, the concentration of NSC23766 that resulted in 50% growth inhibition of leukemic cells was nearly 75 to 100 \u00a5\u00ecM for all cell types examined. This could potentially be due to a lack of a major role of the GEFs Trio and Tiam1 in KITD814V-induced transformation. Alternatively, Rac1 and/or Rac2 alone may play only a modest role in KITD814V-induced transformation. To test these possibilities and to more precisely identify the consequence(s) of interfering with the function of GEFs and Rac in KITD814V-induced transformation, we used a novel Rac inhibitor, EHop-016, which is a derivative of NSC23766 and inhibits Rac 100-fold more efficiently than NSC23766 in breast cancer cell lines (18). As seen in Figure ?Figure4,4, A and B, KITD816V-bearing SM patient?derived HMC1.2 cells, as well as KITD816V- and AML1-ETO?bearing Kasumi-1 cells derived from an AML patient, demonstrated a significant reduction in the growth of these cells in the presence of EHop-016 at drug concentrations that were significantly less (~50-fold in some cases) than those of NSC23766. Importantly, primary SM patient?derived cells bearing KITD816V were significantly more susceptible to growth inhibition in the presence of EHop-016 relative to patient samples lacking the expression of KITD816V (Figure ?(Figure4C).4C). The growth reduction in the presence of EHop-016 was also observed in murine KITD814V?expressing cells and was associated with enhanced apoptosis and repression of antiapoptotic proteins BAD and MLC (Supplemental Figure 4, D?F). Consistent with these findings, while 20 \u00a5\u00ecM of NSC23766 inhibited the activation of Rac1 but not Rac2 in KITD814V-bearing cells, 10 \u00a5\u00ecM of EHop-016 was sufficient to inhibit the activation of both Rac1 and Rac2 in these same cells, which was associated with reduced binding of Vav to Rac (Figure ?(Figure4,4, D and E). These results suggest that inhibition of both Rac1 and Rac2 is essential for maximal growth repression in KITD814V-bearing cells. Further, the Rac inhibitor EHop-016 is substantially more efficient at repressing the growth and activation of Rac1 and Rac2 in KITD814V-bearing cells compared with NSC23766. Consistent with the in vitro findings described above, the treatment of KITD814V-bearing cells with EHop-016 versus NSC23766 significantly enhanced the survival of leukemic mice, as demonstrated by reduced spleen size and PB counts (Figure ?(Figure5,5, A?D). Genetic disruption of Rac GTPases in KITD814V-bearing HSC/Ps inhibits ligand-independent hyperproliferation and MPNs in vivo.. We next analyzed the specific role of Rac1 and Rac2 and also attempted to confirm our findings using dominant-negative Rac (RacN17) and pharmacologic approaches by examining the growth of KITD814V-bearing primary BM cells derived from mice lacking the expression of Rac1, Rac2, or both Rac1 and Rac2. Since complete loss of Rac1 results in embryonic lethality, we used a conditional knockout strain of Rac1, which was crossed with Mx1-Cre mice, allowing for the conditional deletion of Rac1 in BM cells upon treatment with polyI:C (29). As seen in Figure ?Figure6A,6A, and has been previously described, the conditional deletion of Rac1 results in the loss of Rac1 protein. A similar loss of Rac1 protein was also observed in mice lacking both Rac1 and Rac2, as assessed by Western blot analysis using a Rac1-specific antibody (Figure ?(Figure6A;6A; lanes 2 and 4). Low-density BM cells from all three genotypes were prestimulated with cytokines and infected with a retrovirus expressing WT KIT or KITD814V. Figure ?Figure6B6B shows the transduction efficiency of the two viruses in BM cells derived from different genotypes. Transduced cells were sorted to homogeneity for use in a proliferation assay and to assess survival in the absence of Rac proteins. As seen in Figure ?Figure6C,6C, while loss of Rac2 resulted in an approximately 50% inhibition of ligand-independent growth of KITD814V-bearing cells, loss of Rac1 showed only a modest reduction (~10% to 15%). In contrast, BM cells deficient in both Rac1 and Rac2 showed a more profound reduction in the growth of KITD814V-bearing cells (~75%). The reduction in the growth of Rac1/Rac2 double?knockout cells bearing KITD814V was due in part to the reduced survival of cells relative to controls (Figure ?(Figure6D).6D). These findings suggest that the combined loss of Rac1 and Rac2 results in most of the growth repression seen in KITD814V-bearing cells. Restoring the expression of activated Rac in the setting of Rac1/Rac2 deficiency rescued ligand-independent growth in vitro (Supplemental Figure 5A). Furthermore, no compensatory increase in the expression of Rac3 was noted in these cells (Supplemental Figure 5B). To further assess the role of Vav1 and Rac1/Rac2 in KITD814V-induced MPNs, we infected WT or Vav1 ?/? or Rac1/Rac2 ?/? 5-FU?treated BM cells with a virus expressing KITD814V, sorted the cells on the basis of EGFP expression, and transplanted them into lethally irradiated hosts. Supplemental Figure 6 shows the transduction efficiency of 5-FU?treated cells in all three genotypes. As seen in Figure ?Figure7A,7A, a significant increase in the survival of mice bearing Vav1 ?/? or Rac1/Rac2 ?/? KITD814V?expressing cells was observed relative to controls. Further, we observed the rescue of PB counts and splenomegaly in these mice relative to controls (Figure ?(Figure7,7, B?D). The loss of Rac2 alone in the setting of KITD814V expression also prolonged the survival of leukemic mice, but to a much lesser degree compared with mice transplanted with KITD814V-bearing cells lacking the expression of Vav1 or Rac1/Rac2 (Supplemental Figure 7). Role of p21-activated kinase in KITD814V-induced transformation.. As noted earlier, the expression of dominant-negative Rac (RacN17) in KITD814V-bearing cells derived from the spleens of transplanted mice not only resulted in reduced Rac1/Rac2 activation, but also inhibited the activation of Pak. The involvement of Pak in MPNs or in leukemogenesis has never been reported, although recent studies have implicated Pak in regulating the growth and actin-based functions in solid tumors (30?32). To assess the role of Pak in KITD814V-induced transformation and to determine whether Pak functions downstream from Vav1 and Rac1/Rac2 in KITD814V-bearing cells, we examined Pak activation in KITD814V-bearing Vav1 ?/?, Rac1/Rac2 ?/?, RacN17, or EHop-016?treated primary HSC/Ps. As seen in Figure ?Figure8,8, A?D, a reduction in the activation of Pak was observed in every scenario. To assess the direct role of Pak in regulating ligand-independent growth of KITD814V-bearing cells, we used myeloid cells bearing the expression of KITD814V and infected them with a retrovirus expressing a dominant-negative version of Pak (PakK299R). One-hundred percent of the EGFP (reflecting the expression of PakK299R) and hCD4 (reflecting the expression of KITD814V) double-positive cells were sorted to homogeneity and subjected to a biochemical and proliferation assay as described in Figure ?Figure22 (Supplemental Figure 8A). As seen in Figure ?Figure8E,8E, while the expression of KIT and its constitutive phosphorylation was observed in both KITD814V and KITD814V- and PakK299R-coexpressing cells, the activation of Pak was inhibited in cells coexpressing KITD814V and PakK299R relative to controls. Importantly, Pak repression in KITD814V-bearing cells abrogated the ligand-independent proliferation normally observed in KITD814V-bearing cells (Figure ?(Figure8F).8F). The expression of an activated version of Pak (PakT423) in Rac1/Rac2-deficient KITD814V-bearing primary HSC/Ps rescued ligand-independent growth (Supplemental Figure 8B). We next assessed the consequence of pharmacologic inhibition of Pak on the growth of KITD814V-bearing cells using a cell-permeable allosteric inhibitor of Pak, IPA-3 (33). As seen in Figure ?Figure9A,9A, the treatment of KITD814V-bearing P815 cells with IPA-3 resulted in the inhibition of Pak activation, and the treatment of HMC1.2 cells, P815 cells, and Kasumi-1 cells with the same inhibitor led to a dose-dependent inhibition of the growth of KITD816V- and KITD814V-bearing cells (Figure ?(Figure9,9, B?D). Repression of the growth of oncogene KIT?bearing cells in the presence of IPA-3 was largely due to reduced survival (Figure ?(Figure99E). To directly assess the impact of Pak inhibition on KITD814V-induced MPN development, we transplanted C3H/HeJ mice with cells bearing KITD814V and PakK299R as described (27). Transplanted mice were observed for the development of MPNs and survival. Although all KITD814V-bearing mice died by day 15 after transplantation, all KITD814V- and PakK299R-coexpressing mice survived this period and showed a significant delay in disease onset (Figure ?(Figure10A).10A). To assess the changes in tissue pathology in mice bearing cells coexpressing KITD814V and PakK299R compared with those bearing only KITD814V, we sacrificed a cohort of mice on days when the KITD814V-only?bearing mice succumbed to death. As seen in Figure ?Figure10,10, B and C, compared with the KITD814V-bearing control mice, mice coexpressing KITD814V and PakK299R demonstrated a significant decrease in spleen weight and PB counts. In addition, these mice demonstrated a correction in splenic architecture (Figure ?(Figure10E),10E), myeloid cell infiltration in the lung (Figure ?(Figure10D)10D) and liver (Figure ?(Figure10F),10F), and lacked the lesions on lungs normally associated with KITD814V-bearing mice (Figure ?(Figure10G).10G). All of these findings were associated with a reduced percentage (as assessed by EGFP-expressing cells) of leukemic cells in the tissues of mice transplanted with cells bearing KITD814V and PakK299R (Figure ?(Figure1010H). Discussion. Rac and its downstream effector Pak are frequently overexpressed and/or hyperactive in solid cancers including breast cancer (34). In these cells, Rac and Pak have been implicated in regulating invasion and metastasis (35, 36). While substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the role of these molecules in solid cancers, how these molecules regulate oncogene-induced MPNs is poorly understood. We provide in vitro and in vivo genetic, biochemical, and pharmacologic evidence to suggest that the Vav/Rac/Pak pathway plays an essential role in regulating transformation via an oncogenic form of KIT (KITD814V) associated with MPNs and AML and for which no efficacious therapies are currently available. While gain-of-function KIT mutations localized to the juxtamembrane region associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are highly sensitive to inhibition by imatinib, KIT mutations within the second catalytic domain found in patients with AML and SM, including KITD814V, interfere with the binding of imatinib, thus rendering this mutation insensitive to imatinib inhibition (37?39). Our results suggest that inhibition of constitutively active Vav, Rac, or Pak downstream from KITD814V is a highly efficient alternative approach to treating hematologic malignancies involving this mutation. To date, several GEFs for Rac have been identified (40, 41); however, GEFs such as those that belong to the Vav family as well as Tiam-1 have been primarily implicated in tumorigenesis (42?44). Although, the precise mechanism(s) by which these GEFs regulate cancer progression is still unclear, studies suggest that Vav GEFs are significantly more diverse in their ability to activate Rho family GTPases and can regulate the activation of Rac, Rho, and Cdc42, compared with Tiam-1 and Trio, which primarily activate Rac (17, 45?47). While it is unclear how this occurs, the presence of Src homology and cysteine-rich domains in Vav are likely to contribute to this diversity. Our findings using HSC/Ps derived from Vav1-deficient mice engineered to express KITD814V suggest an essential role for Vav1 in regulating the ligand-independent growth of oncogene-bearing cells and in activating both Rac1 and Rac2. Our findings demonstrating the correction of myeloid cell infiltration in the lungs of mice coexpressing RacN17 or PakK299R along with KITD814V suggest that KITD814V-induced metastasis of myeloid cells in these tissues is dependent on Rac and Pak. Furthermore, our results also demonstrate that prolonged survival of KITD814V-bearing mice in the setting of RacN17 expression correlates with marked repression of Rac1, Rac2, and Pak in these cells, and loss of Rac1, Rac2, or both Rac1 and Rac2 substantially represses ligand-independent growth in these cells. These findings were also confirmed by using cells from mice bearing KITD814V in the setting of Vav1 and Rac1/Rac2 deficiency and by transplantating these cells into lethally irradiated WT recipients. Interestingly, our data implicating Rac1 and Rac2 in KITD814V-induced transformation are similar to those reported by Thomas et al. using p210BCR-ABL translocation (48). In both instances, Rac1 and Rac2 deficiency collectively shows a more prolonged survival of leukemic mice. In addition to the genetic approaches to test the role of Rac in MPNs, we also used pharmacologic approaches to test the possibility of targeting Rac GTPases for the treatment of KITD814V-induced MPNs and AML. To this end, we first used an established Rac inhibitor, NSC23766. Previous studies have shown that NSC23766 functions by binding in the pocket of Rac1 that interacts with GEFs such as Trio and Tiam1 but not Vav (17, 49). Our results using this drug suggest that Rac1 does not greatly contribute to KITD814V-induced transformation, since we observed only a 50% reduction in the growth of both murine and human oncogene KIT?bearing cells at very high doses of NSC23766. While reasonable, an alternate explanation may involve a lack of robust involvement of Trio and Tiam1 in KITD814V-induced transformation. Therefore, in an effort to assess whether Rac GTPase could be targeted more efficiently in KIT oncogene?bearing cells, we used a newly described Rac inhibitor, EHop-016 (18). This drug is a derivative of NSC23766 and inhibits Rac 100-fold more efficiently relative to the parental compound (18). EHop-016, like NSC23766, binds to the surface groove of Rac, which is critical for interacting with GEFs. Studies have shown that EHop-016 is more potent than the parental compound in terms of its interaction with the effector domains of Rac (18). This presumably allows EHop-016 to block the activation of additional Rac GEFs in addition to those blocked by NSC23766. Our head-to-head studies comparing NSC23766 and EHop-016 show that EHop-016 is a more potent Rac inhibitor than NSC23766. Although we have no direct evidence to suggest which additional GEFs might be inhibited by EHop-016 in oncogene KIT?bearing cells, previous studies in an MDA-MB-435 metastatic breast cancer line have shown that EHop-016 inhibits the interaction of Vav2 with Rac (18). It is therefore likely that in KITD814V-bearing HSC/Ps, EHop-016 inhibits the interaction of Vav1 with Rac1 and Rac2. We show that the treatment of oncogene-bearing cells with EHop-016 results in the inhibition of both Rac1 and Rac2. Consistent with these findings, Vav1 deficiency in oncogene-bearing cells impairs the activation of both Rac1 and Rac2 and substantially corrects the ligand-independent growth observed in WT oncogene?bearing HSC/Ps, very similar to the growth repression observed in the presence of EHop-016. Downstream from Rac, we show that Pak plays an essential role in KITD814V-induced transformation. We used both an allosteric inhibitor of Pak, IPA-3, as well as a genetic approach to implicate Pak in KITD814V-induced transformation. Although IPA-3 selectively inhibits the activation of Pak1 (33), at higher doses it has been shown to also inhibit the activation of other isoforms including Pak2 and Pak3 (33). Our studies using a dominant-negative form of Pak (K299R) confirmed the IPA-3 findings demonstrating that Pak indeed contributes to KITD814V-induced transformation; whether other isoforms of Pak also contribute to leukemogenesis remains to be determined. As animal models deficient in the expression of Pak isoforms become available, the role of specific isoforms of Pak in transformation can be more readily and efficiently addressed in future studies. Taken together, our studies identify what we believe to be a novel pathway involving Vav/Rac and Pak in regulating nonclassical MPNs such as SM, in which activating the KIT mutation plays an essential role. Methods. Cell culture.. HMC1.2 cells harboring both V560G and D816V mutations were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2% penicillin-streptomycin, and monothioglycerol at 37\u00a1\u00c6C and 5% CO 2 (50). The murine P815 mastocytoma cell line was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 2% penicillin-streptomycin. 32D murine cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS and 2% penicillin-streptomycin. Kasumi-1, an AML cell line, was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% HEPES, 1% L-glutamine, and 2% penicillin-streptomycin and were a gift from Christopher Klug (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA) (51). Mice, cytokines, and antibodies.. C57BL/6 mice and C3H/HeJ mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.

Vav2 ?/? and Vav3 ?/?cells were a gift from Jose Cancelas (Cincinnati Children\u00a1\u00afs Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA). All mice used in this study were 6?12 weeks of age. Murine IL-3, murine IL-6, SCF, Flt-3 ligand (Flt-3), and thrombopoietin (TPO) were purchased from PeproTech. 2,2\u00a1\u00c7-dihydroxy-1,1\u00a1\u00c7-dinaphthyldisulfide (IPA-3) and NSC23766 were purchased from Tocris Bioscience. The discovery and characterization of EHop-016 have been described previously (18). The Cdc42 small?molecule inhibitor, CASIN, was a gift from Yi Zheng (Cincinnati Children\u00a1\u00afs Hospital Medical Center) (54, 55). Western blot analysis and IP experiments were performed as described previously (56). Protein expression was determined using antibodies against Rac1, Rac2, and Rac1/2/3 (Millipore), pPak, Pak, KIT, Vav1, pKIT, total ERK, pMLC, and pTyrosine (Cell Signaling Technology), pBAD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and \u00a5\u00e2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Rac activity was determined by using a Rac activation kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol and analyzed by Western blot using Rac1, Rac2, or Rac1/2/3 pan-antibody. Patient samples.. Cells from the BM and PB of patients with SM were analyzed for KIT mutations (57) and cultured in 100 ng human SCF in IMDM supplemented with 20% FBS and 2% penicillin-streptomycin. Plasmids.. pCMV6 expressing a Myc-tagged kinase-dead (K299R) Pak was a gift from Jeffrey Field (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA) (58). Plasmids encoding RacN17 have been previously described (34). The cDNAs were subcloned into a bicistronic retroviral vector, MIEG3, upstream of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the EGFP gene (59) or human CD4 gene. The pLNCX2-PAK1T423E-IRES2-EGFP plasmid has been described (60). Plasmids encoding MIEG3-RacN17 and MSCV-puro-RacV12 have been previously described (56). Expression of WT KIT and KITD814V receptors in 32D cells and primary HSC/Ps.. Retroviral supernatants for the transduction of 32D cells and primary BM low-density mononuclear cells (LDMNCs) were generated with a Phoenix ecotropic packaging cell line transfected with retroviral vector plasmids using a calcium phosphatase transfection kit (Invitrogen). Supernatants were collected 48 hours after transfection and filtered through 0.45-\u00a5\u00ecm membranes. 32D cells were infected with 2 ml of high-titer virus supernatant in the presence of 8 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml polybrene. EGFP-positive cells or human CD4-positive (hCD4-positive) cells containing the WT form of KIT or KITD814V with RacN17 or PakK299R were sorted to homogeneity and used in the experiments. BM LDMNCs were suspended in nontissue culture plates along with prestimulation media (IMDM containing 20% FBS and 2% penicillin-streptomycin supplemented with 100 ng/ml SCF, 100 ng/ml TPO, 50 ng/ml Flt-3, and 4 ng/ml IL-6) for 2 days prior to two rounds of retroviral infection using 2 ml of high-titer retroviral supernatants (WT KIT, KITD814V, pLNCX2-PAK1T423E, or MSCVpuro-RacV12) on fibronectin fragments (Retronectin; Takara). Forty-eight hours after the last infection, cells expressing WT KIT or KITD814V were sorted to homogeneity based on EGFP expression. MSCV puro cells were selected with 1 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for an additional 48 hours. Transplantation.. Transplantation into C3H/HeJ mice was carried out by administering a single i.v. injection of 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 32D cells bearing WT KIT or KITD814V with or without RacN17 or PakK299R, or 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 KITD814V-bearing 32D cells cultured overnight with DMSO (vehicle), 25 \u00a5\u00ecM NSC23766, or 2.5 \u00a5\u00ecM EHop-016. Mice were harvested at the time of moribundity, and PB, femurs, spleen, lungs, and liver were collected for histopathological and flow cytometric analysis. WT or Vav1 ?/?, Rac2 ?/?, and Mx-cre/Rac1 flox/flox/Rac2 ?/? C57BL/6 mice that were 6-to-8 weeks of age were given a single i.p. injection of 150 mg/kg of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (APP Pharmaceuticals). BM cells were collected 72 hours after injection from the tibia, femur, and iliac crest, and LDMNCs were prestimulated for 2 days in prestimulation media, as described above prior to transduction with retrovirus encoding WT KIT or KITD814V. After two rounds of infection as described above, cells were sorted to homogeneity, and 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells were counted and mixed with 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 supporting fresh splenocytes from WT C57BL/6 mice and administered i.v. by tail vein injection into lethally irradiated (1,100 cGy split dose) C57BL/6 recipient mice. We treated the recipient mice on day 14 after transplantation with two i.p. injections of 300 \u00a5\u00ecg polyI:C administered at 48-hour intervals. Flow cytometric analysis.. Cells expressing either WT KIT or KITD814V were incubated for 30 minutes at 4\u00a1\u00c6C in 10% rat serum before staining with a combination of the antibodies indicated in Figure ?Figure2A.2A. Cells were washed two times with 0.2% BSA in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and analyzed by FACS (FACS and LSR; BD). In vitro functional assays.. Proliferation was assessed by conducting a thymidine incorporation assay. Briefly, cells were washed and starved in the presence of 0.2% BSA without serum or growth factors for 6 to 8 hours. Cells (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4) were plated in replicates of four in a 96-well plate in 200 \u00a5\u00ecl complete medium either in the absence or presence of the indicated growth factors. The cells were cultured for 48 hours and subsequently pulsed with 1.0 \u00a5\u00ecCi (0.037 MBq) [ 3H] thymidine (PerkinElmer) for 6 hours and harvested using an automated 96-well cell harvester (Brandel). Thymidine incorporation was assessed as counts per minute (cpm). Apoptosis was assessed following the starvation of cells and subsequent plating in 24-well plates (2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 cells) in 0.5 ml of complete media (IMDM, 10% FBS, 2% penicillin-streptomycin) in the absence of growth factors. Apoptosis was determined following staining with an Annexin V Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Biosciences ? Pharmingen) and analyzed via flow cytometry. Statistics.. Data are expressed as the mean \u00a1\u00be SD unless otherwise stated. Sigma Plot 12.0 software (Systat Software Inc.) was used for statistical analysis. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The survival probability of transplanted mice cohorts was compared using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with a log-rank test. Study approval.. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Indiana University Laboratory Animal Research Center, and this study was approved by the IACUC of the Indiana University School of Medicine. Samples from SM patients were collected after obtaining written informed consent as approved by the IRB of the Cleveland Clinic/Case Comprehensive Cancer Center and the IRB of the Indiana University School of Medicine and were obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

                "text": "Atorvastatin overcomes gefitinib resistance in KRAS mutant human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells\tThe exact influence of statins on gefitinib resistance in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with KRAS mutation alone or KRAS/PIK3CA and KRAS/PTEN comutations remains unclear. This work found that transfection of mutant KRAS plasmids significantly suppressed the gefitinib cytotoxicity in Calu3 cells (wild-type KRAS). Gefitinib disrupted the Kras/PI3K and Kras/Raf complexes in Calu3 cells, whereas not in Calu3 KRAS mutant cells. These trends were corresponding to the expression of pAKT and pERK in gefitinib treatment. Atorvastatin (1\u00a5\u00ecM) plus gefitinib treatment inhibited proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis, and reduced the AKT activity in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells compared with gefitinib alone. Atorvastatin (5\u00a5\u00ecM) further enhanced the gefitinib cytotoxicity through concomitant inhibition of AKT and ERK activity. Atorvastatin could interrupt Kras/PI3K and Kras/Raf complexes, leading to suppression of AKT and ERK activity. Similar results were also obtained in comutant KRAS/PTEN or KRAS/PIK3CA NSCLC cells. Furthermore, mevalonate administration reversed the effects of atorvastatin on the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes, as well as AKT and ERK activity in both A549 and Calu1 cells. The in vivo results were similar to those obtained in vitro. Therefore, mutant KRAS-mediated gefitinib insensitivity is mainly derived from failure to disrupt the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells. Atorvastatin overcomes gefitinib resistance in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells irrespective of PIK3CA and PTEN statuses through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase-dependent disruption of the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes. The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), gefitinib (Iressa), benefits certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS encodes a small GTP-binding protein involved in many cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. 1 Wild-type (WT) Kras protein has intrinsic GTPase activity that catalyzes the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP, thereby inactivating the growth-promoting signaling. KRAS mutations are detected in more than 25% of lung adenocarcinomas, 97% of which affect codon 12 or 13. 2 These mutations lead to locking of oncogenic Kras into the GTP-bound state, imparing GTPase activity and resultant constitutive activating RAS signaling. Mutational activation of KRAS is associated with primary resistance of gefitinib. 2 However, the exact mechanisms underlying mutant KRAS-mediated gefitinib resistance in NSCLC remain unclear. Besides, the development of clinically effective Kras-directed treatment in cancer therapies has been largely unsuccessful. 3 Other somatic mutations also confer gefitinib resistance. Persistent activation of PI3K signaling by the PIK3CA oncogenic mutation is sufficient to abrogate gefitinib-induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells. 4 Activation of AKT signaling due to PTEN loss-of-function mutation also confers acquisition of resistance to gefitinib in NSCLC cells. 5 KRAS mutation has been found to frequently co-occur with PTEN loss-of-function mutation 6 or PIK3CA mutation 7 in lung cancer cells. However, whether KRAS/PTEN or KRAS/PIK3CA comutants influence gefitinib efficacy remains unknown. Statins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, reduce the synthesis of isoprenoids, geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, and their precursor mevalonate, which are essential substrates for posttranslational modifications of RAS. 8 The antitumor activity of statins has been suggested in various cancer cells including NSCLC cells. 9 Furthermore, previous studies show that statins enhance the tumor-inhibitory effect of many antitumor drugs, such as cetuximab in KRAS mutant human colorectal cancer 10 and celexocib in prostate cancers. 11 Our previous study also indicates that atorvastatin sensitizes NSCLC cells to carboplatin through inhibition of AKT activation. 12 However, the exact influence of statins on gefitinib resistance in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells remains unclear. This study was designed to explore the mechanism underlying gefitinib resistance and the effect of atorvastatin on gefitinib sensitivity in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells. The results indicate that gefitinib fails to disrupt the direct interaction of Kras with PI3K and Raf, contributing to its resistance in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells. Our data also suggest that atorvastatin can overcome gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells harboring KRAS mutation irrespective of PIK3CA or PTEN status. Results. Mutant KRAS-mediated PI3K and Raf pathway is critical for gefitinib resistance. To confirm whether mutant KRAS is critically involved in gefitinib resistance in NSCLC, we treated Calu3 parental cells and its KRAS mutant counterpart with gefitinib for 3 days. Figure 1a showed that gefitinib treatment effectively inhibited Calu3 cell growth with the IC 50 value of 0.43\u00a5\u00ecM. Transfection of mutant KRAS plasmids could significantly suppress the gefitinib cytotoxicity with the IC 50 value of gefitinib increased to 4.2\u00a5\u00ecM. The transfection efficacy of pBABE-puro plasmid (control plasmid) or pBabe puro-KRAS G12V plasmid (KRAS mutant plasmid) was determined by means of western blotting (Figure 1a). As shown in Figures 1b and c, gefitinib dose dependently increased the apoptotic rate and caspase 3/7 activity in Calu3 parental cells, whereas exerted minimal or low effects in KRAS mutant Calu3 cells. Next, we sought to explore the mechanism underlying mutant KRAS-mediated gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells. As shown in Figure 1d, 1\u00a5\u00ecM gefitinib time dependently inhibited the expression of pAKT and pERK in Calu3 cells. However, such inhibitory effect was absent in the presence of mutant KRAS plasmids (the right panel of Figure 1d). The results also showed that 1\u00a5\u00ecM gefitinib time dependently disrupted the Kras/PI3K subunit p110\u00a5\u00e1 and Kras/Raf complexes in Calu3 cells, whereas not in Calu3 KRAS mutant cells. These trends were corresponding to the expression of pAKT and pERK in gefitinib treatment. Mutant Kras directly binds to Raf proteins and the PI3K subunit p110\u00a5\u00e1, leading to constitutive activation of both the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Furthermore, as gefitinib exerts antitumor activity mainly via blockage of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, 13 the above results suggest that mutant KRAS-mediated gefitinib insensitivity was mainly derived from failure to disrupt the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells. Antitumor effect of atorvastatin and gefitinib on KRAS mutant NSCLC cells in vitro. As shown in Figure 2a, clinical dose of atorvastatin (1\u00a5\u00ecM) could effectively decrease the IC 50 value of gefitinib from 8.8 to 1.5\u00a5\u00ecM in A549 cells. Combination of 5\u00a5\u00ecM atorvastatin and gefitinib worked synergistically and more effectively than gefitinib in the presence of 1\u00a5\u00ecM atorvastatin. Similar results were also obtained in Calu1 cells. Activating PIK3CA mutation also confers RTK inhibitor resistance. To demonstrate whether comutant KRAS/PIK3CA mediates gefitinib resistance in NSCLC treatment, the H460 NSCLC cell line harboring comutant KRAS/PIK3CA was chosen. As shown in Figure 2a, the IC 50 value of gefitinib in H460 treatment was 16.4\u00a5\u00ecM, which was higher than that in A549 or Calu1 treatment, suggesting that comutant KRAS/PIK3CA might further decrease the chemosensitivity of gefitinib. Atorvastatin could still enhance gefitinib efficacy in H460 cells (gefitinib treatment versus 1 or 5\u00a5\u00ecM atorvastatin+gefitinib treatment, IC 50=16.4 versus 4.06 or 1\u00a5\u00ecM). Besides, we transfected PI3K mutation plasmid-PIK3CA (E545K) into A549 and Calu1 cells. As shown in Figures 2b and d, atorvastatin could also enhance the gefitinib efficacy in these transfected cells, confirming that atorvastatin can sensitize NSCLC cells to gefitinib in the presence of comutant KRAS/PIK3CA. PTEN loss-of-function mutation is another critical factor causing RTK inhibitor resistance. The H157 NSCLC cell line harboring comutant KRAS/PTEN was chosen to observe the gefitinib resistance. As shown in Figure 2a (curve lines), atorvastatin dose dependently enhanced gefitinib efficacy in comutant KRAS/PTEN H157 cells (gefitinib treatment versus 1 or 5\u00a5\u00ecM atorvastatin+gefitinib treatment, IC 50=18 versus 2.08 or 0.71\u00a5\u00ecM). As shown in Figures 2c and e, although mutant PTEN increased the gefitinib concentration required for inhibition of proliferation of KRAS mutant NSCLC cells (A549 and Calu1 cells), addition of 1 or 5\u00a5\u00ecM atorvastatin could sensitize comutant KRAS/PTEN NSCLC cells to gefitinib compared with each agent alone. To investigate the effect of the atorvastatin?gefitinib combination on apoptosis of NSCLC cells, A549 cells were treated for 48h with atorvastatin and gefitinib alone or their combination. As shown in Figure 2f, atorvastatin alone dose dependently increased the apoptotic rate in A549 treatment assayed by flow cytometry analysis. However, 1\u00a5\u00ecM gefitinib alone could partially induce apoptosis of A549 cells. Combining atorvastatin and gefitinib could produce more apoptotic rate than each agent alone, and 5\u00a5\u00ecM atorvastatin?gefitinib combination worked more effectively than gefitinib in the presence of 1\u00a5\u00ecM atorvastatin. We then observed whether atorvastatin enhanced the pro-apoptotic effect of gefitinib in A549 cells with the comutant KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN by flow cytometry assay. As shown in Figures 2g and h, atorvastatin could still dose dependently increase the apoptotic rate of these two A549 cells (comutant KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN) and sensitize these cells to gefitinib treatment. A similar increase in caspase 3/7 activity was reflected in the apoptotic index of A549 parental cell, or its other two mutant status, suggesting that the addition of atorvastatin significantly enhances the same concentration of gefitinib for reaching the threshold of caspase activation and apoptosis in KRAS mutant alone, or in the comutant KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN status of A549 cells (Figures 2i and j). Similar results were also obtained in another NSCLC cell line Calu1 and its KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN comutants (Figures 2k, l, m, n and o). Atorvastatin and gefitinib synergistically inhibit the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways. Next we explored the mechanisms underlying atorvastatin-mediated increase in gefitinib sensitivity in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells. The PI3K inhibitor-LY294002 and MEK inhibitor-PD98509 were chosen, and whether they could enhance the tumor-inhibitory effect of gefitinib in A549 and Calu1 parental cells and their KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN comutants was subsequently observed. As shown in Figure 3a, LY294002 (30\u00a5\u00ecM) or PD98509 (30\u00a5\u00ecM) alone inhibited A549 cell proliferation by 44.66 or 33.07%, respectively. Additional administration of LY294002 (30\u00a5\u00ecM) or PD98509 (30\u00a5\u00ecM) enhanced the tumor-inhibitory effect of gefitinib (1\u00a5\u00ecM) from 11.76 to 64.83 or 57.78%, respectively. In comutant KRAS/PIK3CA and KRAS/PTEN statuses, LY294002 (30\u00a5\u00ecM) or PD98509 (30\u00a5\u00ecM) alone could still obtain 38.83 or 31.76% and 36.18 or 38.48% inhibitory rates. Additional administration of LY294002 (30\u00a5\u00ecM) or PD98509 (30\u00a5\u00ecM) could still enhance the tumor-inhibitory effect of gefitinib (1\u00a5\u00ecM) from 5.01 to 60.49% or 55.81 and 2.27 to 55.78 or 54.99% in KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN comutants, respectively (Figures 3b and c). The similar results were also obtained in Calu1 cells and their KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN comutant (Figures 3a, b and c). We further observed whether atorvastatin alone or combined with gefitinib inhibited the activation of AKT and ERK. As shown in Figures 3d, e and f, 1 or 5\u00a5\u00ecM atorvastatin alone dose dependently inhibited the activation of AKT by 52.47 or 66.1% in A549 parental cells, by 46.5 or 61.33% in cells with comutant KRAS/PIK3CA, and by 50.5 or 63.9% in cells with comutant KRAS/PTEN. Additional administration of 1 or 5\u00a5\u00ecM atorvastatin enhanced the inhibitory effect of gefitinib (1\u00a5\u00ecM) on AKT activation in A549 parental cell and its KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN comutants (Figures 3d, e and f). However, 1\u00a5\u00ecM atorvastatin alone or combined with 1\u00a5\u00ecM gefitinib could not induce the ERK inhibition of A549 cell and its KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN comutant until the dose of atorvastatin was elevated to 5\u00a5\u00ecM (Figures 3g, h and i). The similar AKT or ERK inhibitory effect mediated by atorvastatin alone or in the presence of 1\u00a5\u00ecM gefitinib was also obtained in Calu1 cells and their KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN comutants (Figures 3g, h and i). Atorvastatin-induced inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways correlates with disruption of the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes. As shown in Figure 4a, immunostaining of A549 cells and Calu1 cells with Kras and PI3K p110\u00a5\u00e1 antibodies revealed that Kras and the PI3K p110\u00a5\u00e1 subunit were well overlapped in these cells. Interestingly, when PIK3CA E545K plasmid or PTEN shRNA was transfected into these cells, Kras and p110\u00a5\u00e1 were also well overlapped. To confirm that Kras directly interacts with the PI3K p110\u00a5\u00e1 subunit in KRAS mutant cells irrespective of PIK3CA and PTEN statuses, we performed immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Figure 4b, Kras directly bound with the PI3K p110\u00a5\u00e1 subunit in A549 cells, and transfection with PIK3CA E545K plasmid or PTEN shRNA enhanced such interaction corresponded with increased kinetics of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Consistent results were also obtained in another KRAS mutant cell line Calu1 (Figure 4c). Next we sought to determine the mechanism underlying atorvastatin-induced inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. As shown in Figure 5a, atorvastatin treatment led to a time-dependent dissociation of the PI3K p110\u00a5\u00e1 subunit from Kras corresponded with inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway in A549 cells, as well as comutant KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN A549 cells. As shown in Figure 5b, after a 48-h treatment, atorvastatin also resulted in a dose-dependent dissociation of the PI3K p110\u00a5\u00e1 subunit from Kras in A549 cells, as well as comutant KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN A549 cells, corresponded with inhibition of AKT kinetics determined by means of ELISA assay (Figures 3d, e and f). Consistent results were also obtained in Calu1 cells (Supplementary Figure 1A and B). As shown in Figure 5c, atorvastatin (1\u00a5\u00ecM) administration had no effects on the interaction of Kras with Raf after 0?48h incubation, corresponding with failure to inhibit the MEK/ERK pathway in A549 cells. Consistent results were also obtained in Calu1 cells (Supplementary Figure 1C). These results may account for no effects of atorvastatin (1\u00a5\u00ecM) on kinetics of ERK in these cells (Figure 3g). However, as shown in Figure 5d, when the dose of atorvastatin was increased to 5\u00a5\u00ecM, it could confer a time-dependent dissociation of Raf from Kras corresponding with the inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway in A549 cells, as well as comutant KRAS/PIK3CA or KRAS/PTEN A549 cells. Consistent results were also obtained in Calu1 cells (Supplementary Figure 1D). Therefore, the above results together suggest that inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways by atorvastatin in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells correlates with disruption of the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes irrespective of the PIK3CA and PTEN statuses. To determine whether the effects of atorvastatin on the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes are derived from its main function inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, we added mevalonate to the culture medium. As shown in Figure 5e, additional mevalonate treatment reversed the effects of atorvastatin on the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes, corresponded with inhibition of AKT and ERK activities in A549 cells. Consistent results were also obtained in Calu1 cells (Supplementary Figure 1E). Atorvastatin and gefitinib synergize in suppressing tumor growth in vivo. It was critical to determine whether the synergistic effect of atorvastatin and gefitinib could exist in vivo. A549 cells, A549 cells harboring PIK3CA mutant or PTEN loss mutant (\u00a1\u00ad1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells each group) were subcutaneously inoculated into the right flank of 6-week-old female nude mice. When tumors grew to \u00a1\u00ad100mm 3 in size, the animals were treated with gefitinib (100mg/per thrice days, oral gavage), clinical dose of atorvastatin (1 or 10mg/kg/day, daily oral gavage), and gefitinib plus atorvastatin (combination therapy was categorized into two groups: 100mg/mouse/once every 3 days gefitinib plus 1mg/kg/day atorvastatin, and 100mg/mouse/once every 3 days gefitinib plus 10mg/kg/day atorvastatin), respectively. To address the long-term survival-prolonging effect of the combination, we further observe the survival rate between control group and different doses of atorvastatin and gefitinib alone and their combination in a cycle of 60 days approximately. As shown in Figure 6a, the survival rate of A549 tumor-beard nude mice treated with atorvastatin plus gefitinib was significantly increased compared with gefitinib treatment agent alone. Similar results were also obtained in nude mice bearing A549 tumors harboring PIK3CA mutant or PTEN loss. We also observed the changes of tumor volume after 21-day treatment. As shown in Figure 6b, the combination of gefitinib and atorvastatin resulted in a statistically significantly reduced tumor volume compared with each agent alone, at both low and high doses, respectively. The statistical analysis for tumor volume after 21-day treatment has been shown in Supplementary Figure 2. Similar results were also obtained in nude mice bearing A549 tumors harboring PIK3CA mutant or PTEN loss. Statistical data for Figures 6a and b are shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of combination of atorvastatin and gefitinib was further confirmed by Ki67 (the biomarker to evaluate tumor proliferation) (Figure 7a) and TUNEL staining analysis (evaluation of tumor apoptosis) (Figure 7b). To explore the mechanism underlying the combination efficacy in vivo, we performed immunohistochemical staining assay to determine the effect of the combination of atorvastatin and gefitinib on the levels of pAKT and pERK in tumor tissues. After 1-week treatment, treatment with atorvastatin plus gefitinib significantly reduced the levels of pAKT (Figure 8a) and pERK (Figure 8b) compared with each agent alone in A549 tumors or tumors harboring PIK3CA mutant or PTEN loss, respectively. To confirm and quantify such findings, the ELISA assay was performed. As shown in Figures 8c and d, the combination of gefitinib and atorvastatin resulted in statistically significantly reduced levels of pAKT and pERK compared with each agent alone, at both low and high doses, respectively. Similar results were also obtained in nude mice bearing A549 tumors harboring PIK3CA mutant or PTEN loss. Discussion. Mutations in the KRAS gene have been found in 20?30% of NSCLC 14 and believed to be critically involved in gefitinib resistance. However, how mutant KRAS mediates gefitinib resistance in NSCLC treatment is still a puzzle. Previous studies have confirmed that mutant Kras directly binds to Raf proteins and the PI3K subunit p110\u00a5\u00e1, leading to constitutive activation of both the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. 15 In the present study, our data show that transfection of mutant KRAS plasmids into WT NSCLC cell line Calu3 confers gefitinib resistance in these cells. Consistent with other reports, 16, 17 this work indicates that gefitinib can efficiently inhibit the activation of AKT and ERK in KRAS WT NSCLC cells, whereas has no effects on the ERK and AKT activities in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells. Specifically, we find that gefitinib has the capacity to inhibit the interaction of Kras with Raf and PI3K in KRAS WT cells, whereas not in KRAS mutant cells. Therefore, combined with the finding that gefitinib shows antitumor activity mainly via the blockage of downstream MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, 13 the present study suggests that the failure of gefitinib to disrupt the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes contributes to mutant KRAS-mediated gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells. RAS has been found to activate several other effector pathways, the two best characterized of which are the Raf/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. 1 Knockdown of mutant KRAS results in decreased ERK activity in various NSCLC cell lines, and reduces the AKT activity in KRAS-dependent NSCLC cells (H358 cells), whereas enhances or has minimal effect on the AKT activity in KRAS-independent A549 NSCLC cells, respectively. 18, 19 Similar results were reported that mutant KRAS knockdown suppresses ERK and AKT activities in the KRAS-dependent SW620 colon cancer cells, while reduces ERK activity but increases AKT activity in the KRAS-independent SW837 cells. 20 In the present study, however, we find that atorvastatin-induced inhibition of ERK and AKT activities may be, at least partly, derived from its disruption of the interaction of Kras with Raf and PI3K in NSCLC cells including KRAS-independent A549 cells. These results suggest that disturbance of direct interaction of Kras with Raf and PI3K reduces ERK and AKT activities in both KRAS-dependent and -independent NSCLC cells. The discrepancy of our results with others may be due to the fact that knockdown of mutant KRAS can influence other genes' expression, for example IL-8. 21 This effect may vary in different cancer cell lines and some factors affected by mutant KRAS knockdown may subsequently enhance AKT activity in certain cancer cells. Furthermore, our data show that atorvastatin can also disrupt the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes in comutant KRAS/PIK3CA and KRAS/PTEN NSCLC cells, leading to decreased ERK and AKT activities. These results suggest that the interaction of mutant Kras to Raf and PI3K is still critically involved in regulation of its downstream ERK and AKT activities irrespective of the PIK3CA and PTEN statuses. Statins have been confirmed to exhibit pro-apoptotic and growth-inhibitory responses in neoplastic cells of diverse origin. For example, Mistafa et al. 22 reported that statins inhibit the growth of pancreatic cancer cells via P2 \u00a1\u00bf 7 receptor-mediated inhibition of AKT signaling. Yanae et al. 23 reported that statins induce apoptosis via inhibition of the geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate biosynthesis and resultant suppression of ERK and Akt activation in glioblastoma cell. The present study finds that atorvastatin itself has obvious capacity to induce NSCLC cell apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation. Besides, atorvastatin administration efficiently suppresses ERK and AKT activation, mainly due to disruption of Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes in NSCLC cells. The results that mevalonate administration reverses the effects of atorvastatin on Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes suggest that atorvastatin disrupts Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes in NSCLC cells through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. These data together suggest that inhibition of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways is closely related to the antitumor activity of statins in various tumors. Furthermore, our results suggest that blockage of interaction of mutant Kras to Raf and PI3K may contribute to a critical molecular mechanism underlying the statins-mediated antitumor effect. The present study shows that atorvastatin at the relative low dose (1\u00a5\u00ecM) works effectively to disrupt the direct interaction of Kras with PI3K but not Raf, whereas a high dose (5\u00a5\u00ecM) of atorvastatin can inhibit the interaction of mutant Kras to Raf. The possible explanation for these effects may be that the affinity of the Ras/Raf complex is higher than that of the Ras/PI3K complex. 24 This explanation may also clarify our previous finding that atorvastatin sensitizes human NSCLC cells to carboplatin via the suppression of AKT but not ERK signaling, 12 as 2.5\u00a5\u00ecM atorvastatin used in such study is not sufficient to disturb the Kras/Raf complex in NSCLC cells. Combining statins and TKIs showed enhanced inhibition and cooperative cytotoxicity in a variety of cancer cell lines. 10, 25 Specifically in NSCLC cells, Park et al. 26 reported that lovastatin overcomes gefitinib resistance in these cells with KRAS mutations by downregulation of the RAS protein, leading to inhibition of both MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. In such a study, lovastatin was confirmed to reduce RAS protein expression, but inhibit AKT activity in KRAS-independent A549 and H460 NSCLC cells. These results seem inconsistent with that knockdown of mutant KRAS enhances or has minimal effect on the AKT activity in KRAS-independent A549 NSCLC cells as mentioned above. The possible reason may be that lovastatin may also disrupt the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes, which makes the effect of lovastatin on AKT activity in these cells complicated. This study combined with ours also suggests that disruption of the direct interaction of Kras with Raf and PI3K may partly account for atorvastatin-mediated inhibition of ERK and AKT activities, and resultant enhancement of gefitinib efficacy in NSCLC cells. KRAS mutation frequently co-occurs with PTEN loss-of-function mutation or PIK3CA mutation in lung cancer cells. However, mutations in both RAS and BRAF as well as PIK3CA and PTEN are rarely concurrent in the same tumor. 27, 28, 29 In the present study, besides in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells, we also find that atorvastatin can overcome gefitinib resistance in comutant KRAS/PIK3CA and KRAS/PTEN NSCLC cells. Therefore, our work suggests that atorvastatin can overcome gefitinib resistance in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells irrespective of the PTEN and PIK3CA statuses. Overall, our results have a number of general implications. We have defined the mechanism of mutant tumor biomarker (KRAS)-mediated shifting signaling inhibitory effect of gefitinib through Kras interacting with PI3K or Raf. We design a therapeutic schedule of atorvastatin plus gefitinib, which could effectively exert a cytotoxic effect on the KRAS mutant NSCLC tumors under various conditions and more substantially prolong the survival rate in preclinical study. Materials and Methods. Cell lines, plasmids, and transfection. Human NSCLC cell lines (originally purchased from ATCC) with documented KRAS mutations-A549 (KRAS G12S), Calu1 (KRAS G12C), H460 (KRAS Q61H PIK3CA E545K), H157 (KRAS G12R PTEN G251C), and one KRAS WT NSCLC cell-Calu3 were used. The procedure of transfection of pBabe puro-KRAS G12V (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA; Plasmid 9052) and the corresponding empty vector pBabe puro was strictly according to a previous report. 30 Human TrueORF PIK3CA E545K plasmid was purchased from OriGene Technologies (Rockville, MD, USA; Cat. no. RC400348). TrueORFs have a C-terminal fusion of MYC/DDK tag. The cloning expression vector is pCMV6-Entry. A549 and Calu1 cells were stably transfected with PIK3CA E545K according to another work. 31 For shRNA experiments, cells stably transfected with the pRetroSuper (pRS; OriGene) and pRS vector expressing shRNA for PTEN knockdown (pRS-shPTEN; OriGene; Cat. no. TR320498) were preformed as that previously reported. 32 Cell proliferation/viability assay, flow cytometry (FCM) analysis of apoptosis and caspase activity assay. The protocols and reagents used for MTT assay (detection of cell proliferation/viability), flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis, and Caspase 3/7 activity assays were all strictly according to our previous work. 12 Immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed according to a previous study. 33 Cells were treated with atorvastatin (1 or 5\u00a5\u00ecM) according to specific time points, and then scraped into ice-cold PBS and lysed with lysis buffer. The cell lysates were incubated with monoclonal anti-Kras antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cat. no. WH0003845M1) then precipitated the resultant immune complexes with protein A-sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL, USA). The immunoprecipitated material was washed and pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to western blotting analysis. Western blotting. Western blotting protocol was as that previously reported with minor modifications. 34 Cells were first seeded at a concentration of 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 cells per 100-mm dish (Corning, Corning, NY, USA), incubated at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 1 day, and then incubated with atorvastatin (1 or 5\u00a5\u00ecM) for specific times. For Western blotting analysis of AKT (Cat. no. 9272), pAKT (Cat. no. 4060), ERK (Cat. no. 4695), pERK (Cat. no. 4370), PTEN (Cat. no. 9188), and PI3K p110\u00a5\u00e1 (Cat. no. 4249), blots were probed with their specific antibodies (diluted with 5% BSA to 1:1000; all antibodies from Cell Signaling, Boston, MA, USA), respectively. The mouse monoclonal anti-flag antibody (diluted with 5% BSA to 1:5000; Sigma?Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) was used to recognize the DDK tag of PIK3CA E545K. Confocal microscopy. Cells seeded on chamber slides were briefly washed with PBS and fixed with cold 100% methanol for 5min. The slides were then subjected to a series of steps according to the previous study, except for the appropriate primary antibodies used in the present study. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:10000 dilutions in PBS). The glass coverslips were mounted with 50% glycerol (in PBS, pH7.6) and examined under a fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters. 35 ELISA analysis. ELISA analysis both in vitro and in vivo using the ELISA analysis kits (pAKT: Cat. no. 7160, CST; AKT: Cat. no. 7170, CST; pERK: Cat. no. 7315, CST; ERK: Cat. no. 7050, CST) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For analysis of AKT and ERK activation in vitro, cells were first treated with atorvastatin (1 or 5\u00a5\u00ecM), gefitinib (1\u00a5\u00ecM), or their combinations for 48h. For analysis of AKT and ERK activation in vivo, tumor-bearing nu/nu mice were treated with atorvastatin 1 or 10mg/kg, gefitinib 100mg/kg and their combinations or control solvent for 1 week. Tumors were snapped frozen and homogenized in cell lysis buffer (CST; Cat. no. 9803). Rations of pAKT to total AKT and pERK to total ERK were determined by specifc ELISA assays. Xenograft studies. Animal handling and procedures were approved by the Qiqihar Medical University Animal Care and Use Committee. Xenograft studies were strictly according to our previous report 12, except drug treatment. TUNEL staining. The TUNEL staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions of In situ cell death detection kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). After 15-min incubation with Proteinase K (20mg/ml) at room temperature, the sections were incubated with 2% H 2O 2 for 5min for blocking endogenous peroxidase. Then sections were incubated with the TdT enzyme at 37\u00a1\u00c6C for 2h. After 30-min incubation with antidigoxin?peroxidase solution, the sections were stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate for 2min and then counterstained with hematoxylin. Thereafter, slides were photographed with a microscope camera system. Immunohistochemistry. The immunostaining assay was performed as previously described. 32 Tissues harvested from A549 and its PIK3CA or PTEN mutant tumors were fixed in 10% formaldehyde overnight and then embedded in paraffin. After deparaffinization, hydration and blockage of endogenous peroxidase routinely, sections were pretreated by microwaving for 20min in Tris-EDTA (pH 9.0) buffer for antigen retrieval. The slides were blocked with 5% goat serum at room temperature for 1h and then incubated with antibody against pAKT and pERK overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1h at room temperature. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, then photographed and converted into a digital image using light microscopy equipped with camera. Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were evaluated by Student's t-test for simple comparisons between two groups and one-way ANOVA for comparions among multiple groups using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA) and JMP7.0 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). In MTT assay, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was calculated using SPSS 12.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Kaplan?Meier analysis was used to plot overall survival and differences in curves were analyzed by log-rank test. All tests were two-sided and expressed as mean\u00a1\u00beS.D. A P-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Disulfiram Treatment Facilitates Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Inhibition in Human Breast Cancer Cells In vitro and In vivo\tFrequent genetic alterations of the components in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway contribute greatly to breast cancer initiation and progression, which makes targeting this signaling pathway a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we showed that in the presence of copper (Cu), disulfiram (DSF), a clinically used antialcoholism drug, could potently inhibit breast cancer cell growth regardless of the PIK3CA status. Surprisingly, the treatment with a mixture of DSF and copper (DSF-Cu) led to the decreased expression of PTEN protein and the activation of AKT in a dose- and time-dependent manner in different cell lines with or without PIK3CA mutations. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with a combination of DSF-Cu and LY294002, a pan-PI3K inhibitor, resulted in the significant inhibition of cell growth when compared with either drug alone. In addition, the combined treatment of DSF and LY294002 significantly inhibited the growth of the breast tumor xenograft in nude mice induced by MDA-MB-231 cells expressing mutant PIK3CA-H1047R and PIK3CA-E545K, whereas neither DSF nor LY294002 alone could significantly retard tumor growth. Finally, the observed in vivo inhibitory effects are found associated with aberrant signaling alterations and apoptosis-inducing activities in tumor samples. Thus, our finding shows for the first time that treatment of breast cancer with DSF results in a novel feedback mechanism that activates AKT signaling. Our study also suggests that the combination of DSF and a PI3K inhibitor may offer a new combinational treatment model for breast cancer, particularly for those with PIK3CA mutations. Introduction. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway has been firmly established for its role in multiple cellular activities, including cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, cytoskeleton reorganization, and membrane trafficking (1?3). The abnormal activation of this signaling pathway leads to various diseases such as diabetes, autoimmunity, and cancer. PIK3CA, the gene encoding the \u00a5\u00e1 form of class IA PI3Ks, is amplified and overexpressed in an assortment of human cancers, including breast, ovarian, head and neck, urinary tract, cervical, and thyroid cancers (4?8). Recently, somatic mutations of PIK3CA were identified in various human cancers with different frequencies (9?13). Specifically, 20% to 30% of breast cancers were found to harbor PIK3CA mutations, making it one of the most frequent genetic alterations in breast cancer. The amplification and somatic mutation of PIK3CA ultimately leads to the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby making PIK3CA a promising target for breast cancer treatment. Although many groups have focused on designing specific PI3K inhibitors, some studies have shown that maximum efficacy and minimum side effects may result from combining the PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitor with other cancer therapeutics that have different mechanisms of action (14?17). Accumulated experimental and clinical evidence supports the notion that the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathway plays an essential role in the upregulation of proliferation, downregulation of apoptosis, and promotion of angiogenesis and development of drug resistance in human tumor cells (18?20). This implicates proteasome inhibitors as potentially novel anticancer drugs (21?24). Consistent with this idea, our group reported that disulfiram (DSF), a clinically used antialcoholism drug and copper-binding agent, is capable of binding copper to form a new complex (DSF-Cu), which inhibits the proteasome and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cell cultures and retards the growth of breast cancer xenografts (22). Although DSF has recently been tested in a phase I/II clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and refractory solid tumors involving the liver, its exact mechanism of action has not been well characterized. In this report, we investigated the effect of DSF-Cu on the AKT signaling pathway, a well-established survival signaling pathway in breast cancer. We found that DSF-Cu treatment on several breast cancer cell lines led to the downregulation of PTEN protein expression and activation of pAKT along with the induction of cell death. This observation prompted us to test the possible synergistic effects of DSF-Cu and the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, in these breast cancer cell lines, as loss of PTEN and activation of AKT may make cells more dependent on the PI3K/AKT pathway, and consequently more sensitive to PI3K Inhibition. Indeed, our in vitro study showed that the combination of DSF-Cu and LY294002 suppressed the growth of various breast cancer cells more effectively than either treatment alone. In addition, the effect was more significant in breast cancer cells with PIK3CA mutations than in breast cancer cells with wild-type-PIK3CA. When given to mice with a human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 expressing mutant PIK3CA, the combined treatment of DSF and LY294002 showed more significant tumor growth inhibition than either single treatment. Moreover, the in vivo inhibitory effects were found associated with signaling alterations, proteasome inhibition, and apoptosis activation, as shown by the accumulation of p27 and BAX proteins, poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and apoptotic nuclei formation detected by multiple assays using tumor samples. Taken together, the information from this study provides a basis for developing a promising therapeutic model in which a PI3K inhibitor and a proteasome inhibitor may be combined to effectively treat breast cancer. Materials and Methods. Cell culture and protease inhibitor experiment. Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231, BT20, MCF7, T47D, and BT474 were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection and grown at 37\u00a1\u00c6C in humidified 5% CO 2 in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MDA-MB-157 and MDA-MB-231 are cells that express wild-type PIK3CA, whereas the MCF7 cell line contains a PIK3CA-E545K mutation. The T47D cell line contains a PIK3CA-H1047R mutation and the BT20 cell line contains two PIK3CA mutations (H1047R and P539R). All MDA-MB-157 and MDA-MB-231?derived cells were cultured with the same medium. The MCF10A and MCF10A-derived cell lines were cultured in serum free medium with insulin, hydrocortisone and epidermal growth factor as described in ref. 25. Caspase-3 inhibitor III was purchased from Calbiochem. Protease inhibitors N-acetyl-L-Leucyl-L-methioninal, trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidin) butane (E64), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), N\u00a5\u00e1-p-tosyl-l-lysinechloromethyl ketone, and N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) were obtained from Sigma. All these reagents were prepared according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions and were used to pretreat cells for 4 hours, followed by treatment with DSF-Cu for 6 hours. Protein lysates were then collected for the Western blot. Construction of recombinant lentivirus and establishment of stable cells expressing mutant PIK3CA. The method was done as described (25). Western blotting. For immunoblotting, we used the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antibodies against pAKT (Ser473), AKT, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), ERK, p-p70s6K, p70s6K, ubiquitin, PARP (Cell Signaling), p27 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and BAX (Sigma-Aldrich); and mouse monoclonal antibodies against V5 (Invitrogen), and \u00a5\u00e2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). A Western blot process was carried out as described (25). Cell proliferation assay. Combinational treatment was performed by incubating cells with LY294002 for 2 days, adding DSF-Cu, and incubation for 1 additional day. After treatment, an MTT assay was performed as described in the protocol (Promega). Human breast tumor xenograft experiments. Five-week-old female athymic nude mice were purchased from Taconic Research Animal Services and housed under pathogen-free conditions. Xenograft experiments were performed in compliance with the relevant laws and guidelines set forth by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of Wayne State University. MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-H1047R and MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-E545K cells (3 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6) were injected s.c. into one flank of each mouse. Tumor size was measured with calipers every other day. Tumor volume (V) was determined by the equation V = (L \u00a1\u00bf W 2) \u00a1\u00bf 0.5, in which L is the length and W is the width of the tumor. When xenografts reached volumes of ~200 mm 3, the mice showing tumors were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 7), a DSF only group (n = 6), a PIK3CA inhibitor LY294002 only group (n = 6), and a combination group (DSF+LY294002; n = 6). These groups received the following treatments thrice weekly by s.c. injection on a different flank of the cell injection: solvent control (PBS/cremophor/DMSO/ethanol, 7.5:1.5:0.5:0.5), DSF (30 mg/kg), LY294002 (70 mg/kb), or DSF (30 mg/kg) plus LY294002 (70 mg/kb), respectively. The experiment was terminated and the mice were sacrificed when the control tumors reached ~1,000 mm 3 (on day 29). The tumors were removed and photographed, and then used for multiple assays including Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). H&E staining, IHC, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase?mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. For H&E staining, paraffin-embedded sample slides were deparaffinized, hydrated, and then stained with hematoxylin for 1 minute. After rinsing, the slides were stained with eosin for 1 minute, rinsed, and sealed with coverslips using Per-mount. For immunohistochemical staining, mouse monoclonal anti-p27 antibody (1:40; Vector Laboratory) and rabbit polyclonal anti-BAX antibody (1:50; Zymed Labs, Inc.) were used. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase?mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed using the ApopTag Peroxidase In situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Chemicon). Statistical analysis. Evaluation of the synergism of two drugs DSF and LY294002 on cell proliferation for each cell line was carried out using a two-way ANOVA F test on the interaction of two factors: DSF concentration levels and presence/absence of LY294002. The evaluation of the synergism of DSF at a single concentration level and LY294002 on tumor burden in vivo was carried out using a balanced 2 \u00a1\u00bf 2 factorial design with six replicates in each category. The drug effect of DSF + 10 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L LY294002 is compared between mutated and wild-type cell lines using t test. All tests apply a significance level of 0.05 without adjustment for multiple tests. All the above-specified analyses were performed in the statistical software R. Results. The effect of DSF-Cu on breast epithelial cells with or without PIK3CA mutation. In an effort to investigate whether DSF-Cu has different effects on breast cancer cell lines with different PIK3CA status, we treated BT20 cells (with P539R and H1047R mutations) and MDA-MB-231 cells (with wt-PIK3CA) with various doses of DSF-Cu under various time courses. There was no observable difference in the dose- or time-dependent effects of DSF-Cu treatment on proliferation in these two cell lines. In addition, DSF-Cu treatment induced significant accumulation of ubquitinated proteins and PARP cleavage in both breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1). Interestingly, treatment with the authentic proteasome inhibitor MG132, which was used as a control, generated a p85 PARP cleavage fragment in both cell lines, whereas DSF-Cu treatment resulted in a p85 fragment in MDA-MB-231 cells and a p65 fragment in BT20 cells (Fig. 1). Taken together, these data suggests that inhibition of cell proliferation induced by DSF-Cu is a common phenomenon in breast cancer cell lines regardless of PIK3CA status. DSF-Cu treatment results in PTEN protein decrease and AKT activation. We next investigated the effect of DSF-Cu on the AKT signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in cell survival and proliferation. We first treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a mixture containing copper and either DSF, clioquinol (CQ), or tetrathiomolybdate (TM). CQ is a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer\u00a1\u00afs disease and has antiproteasomal, androgen receptor?suppressive, proapoptotic, and antitumorigenic activities in human breast and prostate cancer cells in the presence of copper (26, 27). TM is a strong copper chelator currently being tested in clinical trials (28, 29) and was used as a control here. To our surprise, we found that treatment with 10 or 20 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L DSF-Cu or 20 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L CQ-Cu mixtures could significantly inhibit PTEN protein expression, whereas TM-Cu at both concentrations had no effect (Fig. 2A). A kinetic experiment using MDA-MB-231 cells showed a time-dependent decrease in PTEN protein expression with DSF-Cu treatment, which correlated with an initial increase in pAKT levels that decreased at later time points. The total AKT signal was not changed in this treatment (Fig. 2B). To confirm that this phenomenon was not cell line specific, we treated BT20 cells that harbor PIK3CA mutations with 10 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L DSF-Cu and showed a significant time-dependent decrease in PTEN protein expression in these cells as well. Again, p-AKT was abruptly increased with DSF-Cu treatment (0.5?2 h) and then decreased to normal levels (after 2 h; Fig. 2C). A similar phenomenon was also observed with a low level of DSF-Cu treatment (0.5 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L DSF) in BT20 cells, although the decrease of PTEN protein expression was postponed until after 24 hours of treatment and pAKT activation did not last longer than 24 hours (Fig. 2D). We next sought to explore the mechanism underlying the decrease in expression of PTEN upon the treatment of DSF-Cu. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed no significant change in PTEN mRNA level after DSF-Cu treatment in BT20 cells (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that protein stability rather than transcriptional regulation is the major mechanism responsible for the decreased PTEN protein levels in response to DSF-Cu treatment. We then examined the effects of different protease inhibitors on the decreased expression of PTEN protein induced by DSF-Cu in cultured cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, decreased PTEN expression induced by DSF-Cu treatment was attenuated in BT20 cells pretreated with two cysteine protease inhibitors NEM and TPCK. However, when MDA-MB-231 cells were tested, three protease inhibitors, E64, NEM, and PMSF, showed effect in blocking PTEN degradation induced by DSF-Cu (Fig. 3C). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 3D, a caspase-3 inhibitor could not rescue the PTEN degradation in BT20 cells treated with DSF-Cu. Therefore, caspase-3 does not play a critical role in PTEN degradation in DSF-Cu?treated cells. To investigate whether other authentic proteasome inhibitors could also cause a decrease in PTEN protein expression, we used MG132 and PS341, two well-recognized proteasome inhibitors, on breast cancer cell lines with different dose and time courses. The result showed that both MG132 and PS341 treatments led to the activation of pAKT and apparent decrease of PTEN protein in BT20 cells. The effects were less apparent in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Data S1). These data suggest that AKT activation and PTEN protein decrease may be common to all the proteasome inhibitors. Combined treatment of LY294002 and DSF-Cu inhibits cell growth in vitro. AKT is a major cell survival molecule and activation of pAKT is a common cellular response to proapoptotic signaling. PTEN antagonizes PI3K and negatively regulates the AKT signaling pathway (30?32). Suppression of PTEN expression in breast cancer cells leads to AKT activation and confers sensitivity to inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin and AKT (33). In addition, breast cancer cell lines with PIK3CA mutation are more sensitive to PI3K inhibitor than cells with wt-PIK3CA, as evidenced by several reports including our own using newly established cell lines (Supplementary Data S2?4). Considering that DSF-Cu treatment leads to multiple biological effects such as decreasing PTEN and activating AKT, along with its cell death induction function, we investigated whether the combined treatment of DSF-Cu with LY294002 would show an additive or a synergistic effect in killing breast cancer cells and also whether this effect would become more significant in cells with PIK3CA mutation. First, we performed in vitro cell proliferation assays on BT20, MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231, four cell lines with different PIK3CA mutation statuses. The combination of DSF-Cu and LY294002 treatment led to a more significant decrease in cell proliferation than each single treatment alone in all four cell lines (Fig. 4A). Specifically, the effect in BT20 cells was more significant than in MDA-MB-231 cells at three concentrations (P = 0.007, 0.001, and <0.001). MCF7 and T47D cells had very similar effect in response to the combinational treatment (Supplementary Data S5). Statistical analysis indicated that synergism of the two drug treatments was found in all four cell lines (Supplementary Data S5; Fig. 4B). In addition, we performed a similar treatment on a set of isogenic cell models: MDAMB-231/vector cells, MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-H1047R, and MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-E545K (Fig. 4C). We found that combined treatment led to increased proliferation inhibition compared with each single treatment alone in all three cell lines. The effect was more significant in MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-H1047R and MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-E545K cells than in MDA-MB-231/vector cells with 10 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L LY294002 plus 1 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L DSF-Cu (Fig. 4C), although no significant synergism was found with indicated treatment conditions (Fig. 4D). Moreover, the effect of MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-H1047R and MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-E545K cells responding to the combinational treatment is similar (Fig. 4C). We also observed similar results in MDA-MB-157 and MCF10A-derived model cells (Supplementary Data S6). Combined treatment of LY294002 and DSF synergistically inhibits tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells in vivo. To further test our hypothesis in vivo, four different treatments were delivered to a xenograft mouse model created by s.c. injection with MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA H1047R cells. We found that combined treatment, as well as treatment with DSF or LY294002 alone, inhibited tumor growth by 74.5% (P = 0.02), 35% (P = 0.18), and 27% (P = 0.21), respectively, compared with the solvent control (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, tumor burden in the DSF and LY294002 single-treatment groups was reduced by 25% (P = 0.3) and 16.7% (P = 0.4), respectively, whereas in the combined treatment group, tumor burden was reduced by 58.3% (P = 0.02), compared with the control group (Fig. 5B). Two-way ANOVA test was performed and showed synergism of the two drugs DSF and LY294002 on tumor burden in vivo (P = 0.002; Supplementary Data S7). Similarly, in contrast to either single treatment, only the combined treatment could significantly retard the growth of the xenograft tumor induced by the MDA-MB-231/PIK3CA-E545K cells (Supplementary Data S8). Taken together, the in vivo data are consistent with in vitro data and support the hypothesis that the combined treatment of DSF and LY294002 has a more significant effect in targeting breast cancer cells. In addition, the mutation in the helical and kinase domain had no significant difference in response to the combined treatment. To further investigate whether the observed inhibitory effects of the combined treatments and single treatments are associated with signaling alterations or apoptosis induction, tumor samples from xenograft mice were subjected to Western blotting and IHC assays. Western blots using the tumor extracts showed that DSF treatment slightly increased pAKT, whereas LY294002 treatment decreased pAKT and the combined treatment led to a relatively low-level of pAKT compared with control. No significant changes in p70S6K or p-p70 S6K were observed (Fig. 5C). In addition, combined treatment led to significant PARP cleavage compared with single treatment alone or control. Subtle accumulation of ubiquitinated protein was also observed in DSF-, LY294002-, and combination-treated tumors (Fig. 5D). An increase in the levels of the proteasome-targeting proteins p27 and BAX were also observed in the combination-treated sample (Fig. 5D) and confirmed by IHC (Fig. 6A), indicating proteasomal inhibition in these tumor samples. Moreover, apoptosis in tissues derived from xenografts that received the combined treatment occurred about thrice more frequently than in tissues derived from xenografts treated with DSF or LY294002 alone as shown by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 6A; positive control was shown in Supplementary Data S9). Apoptosis induction in tumor samples was further observed by the H&E staining results. In contrast, apoptosis occurrence was not apparent in the control xenograft tumors (Fig. 6A). Overall, the combined treatment of DSF and LY294002 showed significant inhibition of breast tumor growth in nude mice, and this inhibition was associated with aberrant signaling alterations, proteasome inhibition, and induction of apoptosis. Discussion. Although DSF is clinically used as an antialcoholism drug, our group, along with several others, reported that DSF could be used as an anticancer drug (22). One possible mechanism is that DSF may interact with elevated levels of endogenous copper in tumor tissues (34?36) and form DSF-Cu complexes with active antitumor properties, specifically proteasomal inhibition and apoptotic induction. Consistent with previous observations, our current study found that DSF treatment induced an accumulation of many ubiquitinated proteins in different cell lines regardless of the PIK3CA status. We also showed that a low dose of DSF-Cu could induce the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and activate AKT, although it did not significantly inhibit tumor growth in vivo. This observation prompted us to speculate that a combination of low-dose DSF with reagents harboring different mechanisms could result in high therapeutic effects and low toxicity in vivo. In this study, we showed that DSF-Cu treatment decreased the expression of PTEN protein (but not RNA) levels in different breast cancer cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Therefore, inhibition of protein synthesis and/or increase of protein degradation could be the mechanisms underlying this serendipitous observation. However, because decreased expression of PTEN protein upon DSF-Cu treatment was observed in the very early hours, we thus focused on the protein degradation mechanism. Our study showed that different protease inhibitors could reverse the PTEN degradation induced by DSF-Cu in two different cell lines and the cysteine protease inhibitor NEM commonly works in two different cell lines. This result not only confirmed our hypothesis but also is consistent with several previous reports that protease expression could be regulated by a feedback mechanism in response to some proteasome inhibitors (37, 38). Therefore, in our study, the DSF treatment might lead to the upregulation of some protease activity, which in turn may lead to the degradation of the PTEN protein. In the past several years, numerous studies have identified a high frequency of PIK3CA somatic mutations in cancer cell lines and tumor samples, and have clarified the oncogenic properties of mutant PIK3CA in cancer tumorigenesis (39, 40). More importantly, 80% of the PIK3CA somatic mutations were identified in two hotspots, which are separately located in the helical and kinase domains of the PIK3CA molecule. Several recent studies suggest that the mutations in the helical and kinase domains trigger a gain of function through different mechanisms and speculate the contrasting roles of p85 and Ras-GTP in these two mutations (41?43). In addition, these two mutations were also reported to be associated with different prognoses for disease-free survival (44). However, the results of several previous studies using different mutant model cell lines indicated that H1047R and E545K, two mutations located separately in the kinase and helical domains, have very similar response to a pan-PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (13, 25, 45). The in vitro and in vivo assay results of the current study further support this notion, suggesting that the inhibition of the ATP binding site of PI3Ks is a feasible strategy in targeting cancer cells with different PIK3CA mutations. Due to the structural similarity between the isoforms of PI3Ks, a specific inhibitor targeting PIK3CA is still unavailable and, as a result, most developed PI3K inhibitors are pan-PI3K inhibitors. Meanwhile, accumulating evidence has shown that various other PI3K isoforms (e.g., \u00a5\u00e2, \u00a5\u00e4, and \u00a5\u00e3) are also involved in tumorigenesis (46?49). Therefore, a pan-PI3K isoform inhibitor may offer enhanced therapeutic benefits compared with an isoform-specific inhibitor. This notion has been further supported by a recent report that shows that although p110\u00a5\u00e1 activation is required to sustain the proliferation of established PIK3CA-mutant tumors, PTEN-deficient tumors depend instead on p110\u00a5\u00e2 signaling (50). In this regard, a pan-PI3K inhibitor is expected to have the broadest clinical application, as it will target the growth of both PIK3CA mutations and PTEN-null cancers. In our current study, DSF treatment led to decreased PTEN protein and activation of AKT in both cell types with and without PIK3CA mutations. Therefore, we expect that the combination of a pan-PI3K inhibitor with DSF would be more effective than an isoform-specific inhibitor. Many newly identified drugs tested in research or preclinical settings are common apoptosis inducers and the mechanisms of these drugs on cells are not entirely clarified. This drawback limits their transition from research to clinical applications. In our current study, we show for the first time that DSF-Cu treatment on breast cancer cell lines leads to a decrease in the PTEN protein level and an increase in the pAKT level. Both changes are believed to ultimately lead to the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, DSF seems to have two mechanisms of action. On one hand, DSF-Cu inhibits the proteasome, which in turn triggers the death pathway and induces apoptosis. On the other hand, DSF-Cu also activates the PI3K/PTEN/AKT survival signaling pathway (Fig. 6B). Consistent with this observation, our study showed that the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, combined with DSF treatment, not only effectively inhibited cell proliferation in vitro, but also significantly decreased the tumor formation in vivo. Taken together, our current observations reinforce the notion that effective therapy could result from combinations of therapeutic agents with different functional mechanisms. More significantly, our results suggest that a potential proteasome inhibitor and a pan PI3K inhibitor could be a novel and promising combined treatment option for breast cancer therapy.

                "text": "Common PIK3CA Mutants and a Novel 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR Mutation Are Associated with Increased Sensitivity to Saracatinib\tPurpose. Dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Src signaling pathways commonly occur in colorectal cancer. Mutations in the PIK3CA gene are associated with an increase in severity of disease and worse clinical outcomes. Elevated levels of Src have been identified in premalignant lesions and are suggested to play a central role in tumor progression. Because these pathways appear to enhance tumor growth and metastasis, molecularly targeted agents for both pathways are currently being evaluated in early-phase clinical trials. Experimental Design. We used colorectal cancer cell lines and a patient-derived explant model to investigate the efficacy of saracatinib. Mutations in the PIK3CA were evaluated to examine the association between mutations in the PIK3CA gene and sensitivity to saracatinib. Results. We have identified a subset of patients with a PIK3CA (exon 9 and 20) mutation with increased sensitivity to saracatinib. A novel 3\u00a1\u00c7 untranslated region (UTR) mutation was also shown to be associated with increased sensitivity to saracatinib and have a reduced affinity for miR-520a and miR-525a. Importantly, we show that Src inhibition reduces the interaction between Src and p85, subsequently decreasing Akt-dependent signaling. Conclusion. These results indicate that a personalized approach in targeting Src in PIK3CA-mutant patients with colorectal cancers may prove effective in a subset of patients with this genetic alteration. Introduction. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays an integral role in modulating many different cellular functions (1, 2). The serine/threonine kinase AKT is considered the focal point of this pathway whereby AKT disseminates signals to downstream targets that are essential for enhancing cellular survival and proliferation (3, 4). Activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene commonly occur in many different cancers (5) and seem to play an important role in tumorigenesis (6). In colorectal cancer, the PIK3CA gene (exon 9 or 20) has been determined to be mutated in approximately 15% to 20%of the cases (7, 8). Colon cancer cells with mutations in PIK3CA are more resistant to apoptosis (9) and have an increased capacity to metastasize as shown in an orthotopic model (10). Clinically, mutations in the PIK3CA gene have been shown to be associated with an increased risk in rectal tumor recurrence (11) and with worse survival in patients with colorectal cancers (12). Because this pathway appears to be essential for the growth and survival of many tumors, intense drug development of inhibitors of this pathway are currently being investigated. Dysregulation of the non?receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src has been implicated to alter a wide range of tumor cell processes (13). Some of the downstream targets of Src include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a kinase that is important for cell?cell and cell?extracellular matrix interactions and Stat-3, a kinase that enhances survival of cells and angiogenesis (14?17). The activity of Src is tightly regulated and most cells express low levels (18). Activation of Src requires the dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residue at position 527 and subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosine 416, resulting in its catalytic activation (13). Although activating mutations in Src are rare or nonexistent (19), dysregulation of Src has been shown to be important at early stages of cancer development and perhaps even more important during later stages of the disease (13, 20?22). The orally available drug saracatinib is a potent Src inhibitor and has been shown to have a wide range of antiproliferative effects in many different preclinical models (23?25). For instance, we have shown in patient-derived colorectal cancers (23) and pancreatic (25) explant models that saracatinib treatment had antitumor effects only in a subset of explants treated. Of note, biomarkers of sensitivity were identified in both studies. Currently, early-phase clinical trials involving targeted agents for both the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and Src pathways are being investigated. Most of the studies are unselected for biomarker(s) and consequently, either have failed (26, 27) or will not likely find statistical benefit as the majority of these compounds will certainly only affect a small subset of patients. Therefore, identifying biomarkers of sensitivity or resistance ultimately will identify patients who will most likely derive benefit from treatment. In this study, we used a patient-derived colorectal cancer explant model and have identified an association between a mutation in the PIK3CA gene, including a novel 3\u00a1\u00c7 untranslated region (UTR) mutation and increased sensitivity to saracatinib (an Src inhibitor) in colorectal cancers. Furthermore, we show that Src interacts with p85 and treatment with saracatinib disrupts this interaction, subsequently decreasing the activation of AKT and downstream mediators. Materials and Methods. Human explant xenograft model: colorectal cancer explant xenograft model. Patient-derived colorectal cancer tumor specimens were obtained from consenting patients at the University of Colorado Hospital (Aurora, CO; COMIRB # 07-0570). The tumor pieces were then implanted in mice [Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) # 51402007(09) 2E] and expansion was carried out as previously described (28, 29). Tumors were expanded in the left and right flanks of 5 to 6 mice (10 evaluable tumors per group). Mice were randomized into the treatment group (saracatinib) or vehicle group when tumor volumes reached approximately 200 mm 3. Mice were treated daily with saracatinib 50 mg/kg and vehicle by oral gavage for 28 days. Mice were monitored daily for signs of toxicity, and tumor size was evaluated twice per week by caliper measurements with the following formula: tumor volume = (length \u00a1\u00bf width 2) \u00a1\u00bf 0.52. PIK3CA sequencing. We conducted sequencing to examine the mutational status of PIK3CA gene (exon 9 or 20) in colorectal cancer cell lines and explants. DNA was isolated with the Qiagen DNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen). PIK3CA exon 9 or 20 was PCR-amplified and analyzed by direct sequencing of the products as described previously (30). SNaPshot. PCR products were analyzed for mutations with the ABI PRISM SNaPshot Multiplex Kit (Applied Biosystems), according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. The SNaPshot method is based on the dideoxy single-base extension of unlabeled oligonucleotide primers. For each of the mutations, a primer annealing adjacent to the potentially mutant nucleotide was developed. All primers were designed with a similar melting temperature and were checked for the absence of base pairing with other SNaPshot primers. Evaluation of Src gene copy. An Src FISH probe was developed to evaluate Src gene copy number as previously described (30). Continuous variables for Src gene copy number were categorized and a conservative approach was used for cell lines and explants in determining a gain in Src gene copy number. An Src copy number of 3 or above was considered a gain and less than 3 was considered no gain. Determination of sensitive and resistant molecular biomarkers. Total RNA from all colorectal cancer explants were profiled with the Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 ST Array. Sample preparation and processing procedure were done as described in the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs manual (Affymetrix). The gene expression levels were converted to a rank-based matrix for each micro-array. Data analyses were done on this rank-based matrix. Gene set analysis was conducted as previously described (31). Gene set permutations were conducted 1,000 times for each analysis. We used the nominal P value and normalized enrichment score to sort the pathways enriched in each phenotype. We used the pathway defined by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; ref. 32). The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession number is {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE36006\",\"term_id\":\"36006\"}}GSE36006. Immunoprecipitation. Equal amounts of protein and volume in each group were used for the immunoprecipitation procedures. Five microliters of anti-Src or p85 antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) was added to each sample followed by incubation (rotator) at room temperature for 1 hour. After 1 hour, 30 \u00a5\u00ecL of protein G magnetic beads (Invitrogen-Dynal) was added to each sample and incubated for an additional 30 minutes. The samples were boiled for 5 minutes and loaded onto a 4% to 12% SDS-PAGE. p85 and p110 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies) were used for detection at a dilution of 1:1,000. Immunoblotting. Forty micrograms of sample was electrophoresed on Bis?Tris precast gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking, Src, AKT, PDK, FAK, Stat-3, ribosomal S6, p27 kip1, SGK3, actin (Cell Signaling Technology), or p-FAK Tyr861 (BioSource International), primary antibody was added at 1:1,000 in TBS with Tween (TBST) containing 5% bovine serum albumin. After washing 3 times with TBST, the membrane was incubated with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase?conjugated antibody at a final dilution of 1:50,000 in TBST. After washing 3 times with TBST, bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. miR-520a and miR-525. A dual-luciferase UTR-binding assay was conducted according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions (Promega). The 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR of PIK3CA containing the predicted miR-520a and miR-525 target sequence (base pairs 3,323? 3,487) was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into the psiCHECK-2 plasmid. Perfect match primers were used in an initial round of PCR, followed by PCR amplification of the product with primers containing XhoI and NotI restriction sites for cloning into the psiCHECK-2 plasmid. PCR products were initially cloned into T-Vector (Invitrogen), sequenced and selected for wild-type and mutant alleles. Both wild-type and mutant sequences were present in the cDNA sample and thus creation of a mutation in the binding site was not necessary; rather both alleles were cloned from the same reaction and confirmed again by direct sequencing of the clones with the psiCHECK-2 reverse primer. The psiCHECK-2 vectors containing the region of PIK3CA, as described, are designated psi-PIK3CA-WT and psi-PIK3CA-MUT. Inhibition of expression of the luciferase reporter gene by miR-520a or miR-525 was assayed in HEK293 cells cotransfected with either a vector control (psiCHECK-2) or a luciferase construct psi-CHECK2-PIK3CA-UTR and a negative control mimic and mimics of miR-520a and miR-525 (Dharmacon). Statistical analysis. An unpaired Student t test was used to determine whether the means between control and saracatinib were significant at end of treatment (~28 days). The differences were considered significant when the P value was <0.05. All error bars are represented as the SE. A tumor growth index (TGI) was calculated (mean tumor/mean control \u00a1\u00bf 100) and a cutoff point of 50% was used to dichotomize treatment effects into sensitive (TGI < 50%) and resistant (TGI \u00a1\u00c3 50%). A 2 \u00a1\u00bf 2 contingency table was used to compare the association between a mutation in the PIK3CA gene (exon 9, 20, and 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR) and sensitivity to saracatinib. Fisher\u00a1\u00afs exact test was used to calculate statistical significance. All analyses were carried out by GraphPad Prism version 5.0c for Windows (GraphPad Software). Results. Association between PIK3CA mutations/PTEN-null and increased sensitivity to saracatinib in colorectal cancer. A total of 23 colorectal cancer cell lines were previously treated with saracatinib and the antiproliferative effects were examined by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (23). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, the 3 colorectal cancer cell lines LS180, LS174T, and H508 had the greatest sensitivity (IC 50 < 0.5 \u00a5\u00ecmol/L) to saracatinib. Examination of the PIK3CA gene revealed that all 3 cell lines harbor a mutation within exon 9 or 20 of the gene (Supplementary Table S1). Fisher\u00a1\u00afs exact test was conducted to compare whether a mutation in PIK3CA gene was associated with increased sensitivity to saracatinib. As displayed in Table 1, a significant association (P < 0.0474) between PIK3CA mutation and increased sensitivity was evident in these cell lines. We next examined the predictive power of PIK3CA mutation in the colorectal cancer cell lines in 17 colorectal cancer patient-derived explants. Supplementary Table S2 shows the type of tumor, stage of disease, previous treatment, and PIK3CA mutational status of the explants of patients with colorectal cancers. As shown in Fig. 1A, only 2 colorectal cancer explants showed sensitivity (static effects, but no regression) to saracatinib (TGI \u00a1\u00c2 50%). Sequencing the PIK3CA gene (exon 9 and 20) in all colorectal cancer explants revealed that both sensitive tumors CRC007 and 040 harbor a mutation. In addition, all colorectal cancer explants were evaluated by SNaPshot that tests more than 269 common mutations in cancer (Fig. 1). The relationship between PIK3CA and sensitivity to saracatinib in colorectal cancer explants was evaluated by Fisher\u00a1\u00afs exact test. As shown in Table 1, a significant association (P = 0.0441) between PIK3CA mutation and sensitivity was identified. Combining the colorectal cancer cell lines and explants resulted in a greater association (P = 0.0020) between PIK3CA mutation and increased sensitivity to saracatinib (Table 1). The overall prevalence of PIK3CA mutations in this study in the combined 40 colorectal cancer cell lines and explants was 32.5%. Finally, we compared all PIK3CA wild-type versus PIK3CA-mutant colorectal cancer explants with respect to percentage of TGI. A significant decrease (P = 0.0157) in the percentage of TGI was seen in tumors with a PIK3CA mutation that were treated with saracatinib when compared with wild-type (Fig. 1B). We next were interested to see that whether a loss of PTEN also resulted in enhanced sensitivity to saracatinib. The PTEN isogenic (PTEN null and PTEN wild-type) HCT116 cell line was provided to us from Dr. Volgestein\u00a1\u00afs laboratory at Johns Hopkins (Baltimore, MD). Both the PTEN-null and PTEN wild-type cell lines were evaluated in a xenograft model. As displayed in Fig. 2, treatment with saracatinib (50 mg/kg/d) resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth in the PTEN-null cell line (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no effect with treatment was seen in the PTEN wild-type (Fig. 2B) cell line. As expected, an increase in the activation of AKT was seen in the PTEN-null tumor when compared with the PTEN wild-type tumor (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, Src activation was upregulated in the PTEN-null cell line when compared with the PTEN wild-type cell line. In addition to the PTEN isogenic cell line, we analyzed the explants for PTEN mutations and response to saracatinib. However, all colorectal cancer explants were PTEN wild-type (Fig. 1A) and protein levels of PTEN by Western blotting showed protein visible on the immunoblot (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that mutations in PIK3CA or PTEN have enhanced sensitivity to saracatinib in colorectal cancer preclinical models. Effects of saracatinib on the Src and PI3K/AKT pathways. To gain further insight into the mechanism whereby treatment with saracatinib reduces the activation of the PI3K pathway, we assessed the effects of Src inhibition on the Akt and Src pathways by immunoblotting in the LS180 sensitive cell line. As expected, saracatinib treatment reduced the activity of Src, FAK, and STAT-3 at all time points (0.5, 1, 4, 8, and 24 hours) examined in the sensitive LS180 cell line (Fig. 3A). In addition, treatment altered the phosphorylation of PDK-1 (1 hour maximal decrease) and significantly decreased the activation of Akt at 4, 8, and 24 hours after treatment (Fig. 3A). There were no differences identified with respect to saracatinib treatment and modulation of phosphorylated/total PTEN levels and with the activation of the AKT-independent PDK-1 target SGK-3 (data not shown). In addition, treatment increased the levels of p27 KIP1, an Akt target protein involved in cell-cycle regulation and the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 at 24 hours following treatment (Fig. 3A). We next examined the interaction between Src and PI3K (p85 and p110) in our LS180 sensitive cell line by co-immunoprecipitation studies. As displayed in Fig. 3B, treatment with saracatinib resulted in a decrease in the interaction between Src and p85 at 30 minutes, 1, and 4 hours after treatment. Conversely, saracatinib treatment increased the interaction between p85 and p110 at 30 minutes, 1, and 4 hours after treatment, suggesting that Src inhibition decreases the binding of Src to p85, resulting in an increase in the interaction between p85 and p110. We also investigated the AKT pathway in our CRC040 sensitive explant, HT29 resistant cell line, and CRC020 resistant explant (Fig. 3C). Of note, HT29, CRC020, and CRC040 have mutations in PIK3CA exon 9 or 20. Treatment with saracatinib (50 mg/kg/d) decreased the activation of Src, Akt, and ribosomal S6 in both explants when evaluated 28 days after treatment. Similar results were identified with respect to the activation of Src, Akt, and ribosomal S6 in the resistant HT29 cell line. Overall, these results indicate that saracatinib treatment not only inhibits the Src pathway but also downregulates the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway. Association between increased Src gene copy number and resistance to saracatinib. Previous work from our group showed a trend toward significance with SRC gene copy number and resistance to saracatinib (23). In this study, we evaluated SRC gene copy number in additional 7 colorectal cancer explants by FISH. Together with our previous work, a significant association (P < 0.05) is now evident with respect to an increased Src gene copy number and resistance to saracatinib (Supplementary Table S3). Of note, a gain in Src gene copy was identified in conjunction with an increase in chromosome 20, showing that the Src gene was not amplified. Src and PI3K pathways are upregulated in PIK3CA mutant sensitive. To investigate the differences between PIK3CA-mutant?sensitive versus PIK3CA-mutant?resistant cell lines and explants, we conducted gene array and pathway analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, many components of the Src and PI3K pathways were upregulated (highlighted in red; A, pathway and B, heatmap) in the PIK3CA-mutant?sensitive cell lines and explants when compared with those PIK3CA-mutant and -resistant. Interestingly, b-Raf and extracellular signal? regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 also had increased gene expression in PIK3CA-mutant?sensitive (data not shown). In contrast, expression of genes involved in cell-cycle control were increased in PIK3CA-mutant?resistant when compared with PIK3CA-mutant?sensitive (data not shown). A novel PIK3CA 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR (c.*19T>C) identified in colorectal cancer explants. Analysis of the PIK3CA sequence in our colorectal cancer explants revealed a novel mutation in the 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR of the PIK3CA gene in 2 of our explants (CRC007 and CRC042). Whereas CRC042 showed some sensitivity to saracatinib (TGI = 65%), CRC007 had the greatest sensitivity (TGI = 23%) among all of the colorectal cancer explants tested (Fig. 5A). Comparison of normal versus tumor tissue in CRC042 revealed that this mutation was the result of a somatic mutation, as the mutation was not identified in the germ line (Fig. 5B). Unfortunately, no normal tissue was available for analysis on CRC007. Evaluation of p110-\u00a5\u00e1 protein levels in the colorectal cancer explants showed that CRC007 had the highest levels of p110 protein (Fig. 5C) when compared with other explants. Because we identified this mutation in the 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR (c* 19T>C) of the PIK3CA gene, an online search (www.targetscan.org) was conducted to identify miRNAs that have the potential to bind this region where the mutation is located. miR-520a-5p and miR-525-5p were predicted to be targets of this region in the 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR (c.*19T>C). We next set out to determine whether this mutation altered the binding of miR-520a and miR-525. We cloned the 164-bp wild-type sequence and the 164-bp mutant sequence separately into a psiCHECK-2 vector and conducted a dual luciferase assay 24 hours after the addition of the miR-520 and miR-525. As shown in Fig. 5D, the addition of miR-520a and miR-525 significantly reduced the luciferase signal in the wild-type sequence, whereas no differences from control were observed in the mutant miR-520a and miR-525. These results suggest that a mutation in the 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR (c* 19T>C) reduces the binding of miR-520a and miR-525, resulting in an increase in protein levels of the p110-\u00a5\u00e1 subunit of PI3K. Discussion. The heterodimeric (regulatory and catalytic subunits) PI3K lipid kinase phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). This triggers a cascade of events whereby PIP3 phosphorylates PDK-1 that in turn activates Akt, resulting in the potentiation of cellular growth and proliferation. The PIK3CA gene (p110-\u00a5\u00e1 subunit) is located on chromosome 3q26.3 and 3 common mutations have been described that include 2 helical mutations at E542K and E545K (exon 9), which alters the inhibitory effects of p85 and one kinase domain mutation at H1047R (exon 20) that enhances the catalytic lipid kinase activity (6). All 3 mutations have been shown to be functionally relevant in the dysregulation of Akt-dependent and -independent signaling (33, 34). In this preclinical study, we showed that a PIK3CA mutation in exon 9 or 20 as well as a novel 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR (c.*19T>C) mutation was associated with enhanced sensitivity to saracatinib in both colorectal cancer cell lines and a patient-derived colorectal cancer explant model. In our colorectal cancer preclinical model, we have identified a subset of tumors that harbor PIK3CA mutations that have increased sensitivity to saracatinib. In particular, PIK3CA mutations in exon 9 or exon 20 were identified in 3 sensitive cell lines (LS180, LS174T, and H508) and 2 sensitive colorectal cancer explants (CRC007 and CRC040). Of note, gene amplification of the PIK3CA region was identified in the resistant colorectal cancer explants CRC006 and CRC012. Evaluation of colorectal cancer explants showed a significant decrease in TGI in PIK3CA mutants when compared with wild-type tumors. These findings indicate that the Src pathway plays an important role in regulating the growth of tumors with PIK3CA mutations. More recently, the importance of PIK3CA mutations and clinical outcomes has been investigated. In particular, mutations in the PIK3CA gene have been shown to be associated with local recurrences in rectal cancer and predictive of poor outcomes in patients with colorectal cancers (11, 12). He and colleagues (11) examined PIK3CA mutations in 240 rectal tumors and showed that the patients with a mutation in PIK3CA gene (exon 9 or 20) were more likely to have disease recurrence. In addition, Kato and colleagues (12) showed PIK3CA mutations to be independent predictors of worse survival among 158 patients with colorectal cancers. These studies, as well as our findings in our preclinical study, may have important implications for treatment of patients with colorectal cancers; saracatinib treatment may only be effective in patients with colorectal cancers with PIK3CA mutations and treatment may ultimately decrease disease recurrence and improve outcomes in this subset of patients. Both Fak and Stat-3 are well-known targets of Src and are involved at controlling many biologic processes involved in cell survival and metastasis (14, 15, 17). Previously, we have shown in the sensitive cell lines LS174T and H508 that saracatinib treatment reduced the activation of Src, Fak (Tyr861), and Stat-3 (Tyr 705; ref. 23). Interestingly, these cell lines also exhibited greater Src activation than in the resistant cell lines SW620 and SW480 (23). As expected, in this study, we found similar results in the LS180 sensitive cell line; treatment with saracatinib resulted in a decrease in the phosphorylation of Src, Fak, and Stat-3. Because we identified a significant association between PIK3CA mutants and sensitivity to saracatinib, we next explored the interaction between Src and the PI3K/Akt pathway. We showed that Src inhibition resulted in a decrease in the activation of PDK-1 and Akt. As previously investigated, oncogenic mutations in the PIK3CA gene also have Akt-independent effects, mainly through the activation of SGK-3 (33); however, we did not observe Akt-independent effects, as saracatinib did not alter the activation of SGK-3. Interestingly, saracatinib treatment also inhibited the Akt pathway in the resistant cell line HT29 and resistant CRC020 explant, suggesting that although PIK3CA is mutated in this cell line and explant, other genetic abnormalities may be present and more important at driving the growth of these tumors. Identifying these genetic differences will provide a stronger PIK3CA marker of sensitivity. Previously, we have shown that the main effects of saracatinib on cellular proliferation are by inducing cell-cycle arrest and not apoptosis (23). Therefore, we examined the Akt downstream targets ribosomal S6 and p27 KIP1. Both p27 KIP1 and ribosomal S6 have been shown to be important regulators of the cell cycle and cell growth, respectively (35, 36). Saracatinib treatment decreased the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 and increased levels of p27 KIP1. Furthermore, Stat-3 and Fak have been shown to be involved in cellular proliferation and cell-cycle control (37, 38) and, as discussed above, saracatinib also reduced the activation of Stat-3 and Fak. Taken together, these results indicate that saracatinib may induce cell-cycle arrest in PIK3CA-mutant tumors through inhibition of the downstream targets of the Src and PI3K signaling pathways. We also set out to determine the upstream effects of Src inhibition on the PI3K pathway. A study by Lu and colleagues (39) showed that Src interacts with the tumor suppressor PTEN to regulate the PI3K pathway. For instance, greater activity of Src reduces the stability of PTEN, resulting in an increase in the Akt pathway (39). In addition, Zhang and colleagues (40) identified a mechanism whereby PTEN downregulates Src activity. In this study, we did not observe any effects with treatment on the phosphorylated/total PTEN levels. Therefore, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation studies with Src and p85 and showed that saracatinib reduces the interaction between Src and p85 and, as a result, enhances the binding of p85 and p110. Given that Src inhibition increases p85/p110 heterodimerization and the p85 subunit of PI3K in its inactivated form stabilizes and prevents the activation of the p110 subunit (41) indicates a possible mechanism where saracatinib decreases the PI3K/AKT pathway in tumors with PIK3CA mutations. In this study, we identified a subset of PIK3CA-mutant cell lines and explants that were sensitive to saracatinib. To have a better understanding of the genetic differences between PIK3CA-mutant?sensitive and -resistant cell lines and explants, we conducted gene array and pathway analysis. We show that the Src and PI3K pathways were enriched in the PIK3CA-mutant saracatinib?sensitive cell lines and explants, suggesting that the growth of these tumors were more dependent on Src and PI3K pathways. These results were consistent with our previous study showing that the activation of Src was the greatest in cell lines and explant tumors that were sensitive to saracatinib. Additional genetic studies on PIK3CA-mutant?resistant tumors are needed to further define the important aberrations driving tumor growth in this subset of tumors. In this study, we identified a novel mutation (T?C transition) in CRC007 and CRC042 in the 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR that is located 19 base pairs from the stop codon of the PIK3CA gene. Similar to the PIK3CA helical and kinase domain mutations (CRC040, LS180, H508, and LS174T), CRC007 (TGI = 23%) and CRC042 (TGI = 65%) exhibited sensitivity to saracatinib. Of note, although, saracatinib had some treatment effects on CRC042 in our study, this explant was classified as resistant. Analysis of p110 protein levels revealed an increase in protein expression in CRC007 (highest) and CRC042, when compared with other colorectal cancer explants. These findings indicate that this mutation in the 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR (c* 19T>C) may alter the binding of miRNA (s), resulting in an increase in p110 protein translation. Given this observation, we searched for potential miRNAs with a predicted sequence match for this region and identified miR-520a-5p and miR-525-5p. Herein, we determined that both miR-520a-5p and miR-525-5p decreased luciferase reporter gene activity arising from wild-type PIK3CA but did not have an effect on the activity from the mutant PIK3CA sequence. These results show that we identified the PIK3CA gene as a target for miR-520a-5p and miR-525-5p and further show that the mutation in the 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR (c.*19T>C) of the PIK3CA gene reduces the binding of both miRNAs. Whether this increase in p110 protein expression translates to enhanced PI3K activity remains to be determined. Perhaps, with increased extracellular stimuli promoting tumor growth in conjunction with enhanced levels of p110 in the PIK3CA-mutant 3\u00a1\u00c7 UTR (c.*19T>C) tumors may enhance the activity of this pathway. Our colorectal cancer explant model has been used previously to predict biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance (23, 25, 42?44). Although, we feel that this model more closely reflects tumor heterogeneity and growth characteristics seen in patients when compared with cell lines, one of the main limitations with this model is the limited dynamic range. As is the case with using IC 50 arbitrary cutoff values in in vitro drug potency studies, there are also limitations using TGI cutoff values (TGI \u00a1\u00c2 50%, sensitive and TGI > 50%, resistant) in our colorectal cancer explant model. One of the main difficulties is how to interpret small differences in TGI. For example, it is highly probable that a TGI of 49% (we classify as sensitive) and 51% (we classify as resistant) are not very different with respect to treatment effects. Thus, as there is a limited dynamic range in this model, we generally do not use tumors with intermediate sensitivity and typically compare tumors with a TGI \u00a1\u00c2 50% (sensitive) to the most resistant tumors with a TGI of approximately >80% for biomarker development. Whether this is the best way of categorizing tumors based on sensitive and resistance remains to be determined. Although the benefit of saracatinib in clinical trials has been disappointing, identification of biomarkers of sensitivity may further define a population of patients who will benefit from treatment with this compound, or point the way toward effective combination strategies. In our colorectal cancer preclinical model, saracatinib reduced tumor growth in a subset of tumors with a PIK3CA mutation. Our data show that in addition to inhibiting the Src pathway, saracatinib disrupts the activation of the Akt pathway thereby enhancing cell-cycle arrest in tumors with PIK3CA mutations. Because saracatinib was not effective on all tumors with PIK3CA mutations, additional studies are warranted to further define the genetic differences between PIK3CA-mutant?sensitive tumors and PIK3CA-mutant?resistant tumors. This will ultimately provide a more robust biomarker for patient selection. Whether these results translate to the clinical setting remains to be determined. These findings are being translated into a biomarker-driven clinical trial, which is currently under development. Translational Relevance. The Src and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways are frequently dysregulated in colorectal cancer and play an important role in tumorigenesis. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the Src inhibitor, saracatinib, in a preclinical colorectal cancer model and to identify biomarkers of sensitivity. Here, we show that a mutation in the PIK3CA gene is associated with enhanced sensitivity to saracatinib. In addition to the common helical (E542K and E545K) and kinase (H1047R) mutations, a novel 3\u00a1\u00af untranslated region mutation in the PIK3CA gene was also shown to be associated with increased sensitivity to saracatinib. This mutation resulted in a reduced affinity for miR-520a and miR-525a as well as increased levels of p110-a when compared with wild-type. Importantly, treatment with saracatinib inhibits the Src pathway and the activation of Akt-dependent signaling by altering Src and p85 interaction. Thus, these results indicate that a subset of patients with colorectal cancer with a PIK3CA mutation may derive benefit from treatment with the Src inhibitor saracatinib. Supplementary Material.

                "text": "The AKT inhibitor AZD5363 is selectively active in PI3KCA mutant gastric cancer, and sensitizes a patient-derived gastric cancer xenograft model with PTEN loss to Taxotere\tIntroduction. Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is a common phenomenon in cancer due to multiple mechanisms, including mutation of PI3KCA, loss or mutation of PTEN, or over-expression of receptor tyrosine kinases. We recently developed a novel AKT kinase inhibitor, AZD5363, and demonstrated that HGC27, a cell line harboring both PI3KCA mutation and PTEN loss, displayed the greatest sensitivity to this AKT inhibitor in vitro and in vivo. Case preparation. To further elucidate the correlation between AZD5363 response and genetic alterations in gastric cancer (GC) and identify GC patients with both PI3KCA mutations and PTEN loss, we investigated the effects of pharmacological inhibition of AKT on a panel of 20 GC cell lines and genetic aberrations in tumor samples from a cohort of Chinese GC patients. We demonstrated that GC cells with PI3KCA mutations were selectively sensitive to AZD5363. Disease linkage studies showed that PI3KCA activating mutations or PTEN loss were found in 2.7% (4/150) and 23% (14/61) of Chinese GC patients respectively. To further dissect the role of PI3KCA mutation and PTEN loss in response to AKT inhibition, we tested the antitumor activity of AZD5363 in two patient-derived GC xenograft (PDGCX) models harboring either PI3KCA mutation or PTEN loss. Our data indicated that AZD5363 monotherapy treatment led to a moderate response in the PI3KCA mutant PDGCX model. Whilst monotherapy AZD5363 or Taxotere were ineffective in the PTEN negative PDGCX model, significant anti-tumor activity was observed when AZD5363 was combined with Taxotere. Conclusion. Our results indicated that PI3KCA mutation is an important determinant of response to AKT inhibition in GC and combination with AZD5363 can overcome innate resistance to Taxotere in a PTEN loss PDGCX model. It is suggested that AKT inhibitor is an attractive option for treatment of a new segment of GC patients with aberrant PI3K/AKT signaling. Introduction. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most lethal malignancies and the second leading cause of cancer death [1]. The estimated global incidence and mortality of GC in 2011 were 990,000 and 737,000 cases respectively, accounting for approximately 8% of total cancer cases and 10% of annual cancer deaths worldwide [2]. Geographically, GC is far more prevalent in developing countries compared to developed nations. Nations of high prevalence include Eastern Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and South America, accounting for ~70% of the total cases. The conventional treatments for GC include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy [3]. Although these modalities are able to prolong the overall survival of patients with early disease by 20-35%, they have very limited efficacy in treating patients with advanced GC, conferring a median survival time in the range of 6?11?months, with considerable treatment-related toxicities [4]. Due to the complexity of the molecular signaling pathways involved in carcinogenesis and the lower prevalence in western countries, the development of targeted therapies for GC has lagged compared to many other cancer indications. Overexpression/amplification of Her2 has been observed in 10-38% GC patients [5]. The recent phase III ToGA trial involving 3,800 GC patients indicated that the combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapy in Her2+ GC patients led to a significantly higher overall response rate (ORR), 47% versus 35%, significantly longer progression free survival (PFS) interval, 6.7?months versus 5.5?months, and significantly longer OS duration, 13.8?months versus 11.1?months compared to the chemotherapy arms respectively [6]. This positive result led to the approval of trastuzumab as the first molecularly targeted therapeutic agent for GC in both the U.S. and Europe. AKT is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a central role in the signaling network involving PI3K and mTOR, and which regulates multiple cellular processes including glucose metabolism, apoptosis, cell proliferation, transcription and cell migration. Under normal conditions, this signaling network can be activated by many receptors, including members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) families and their ligands. The activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling network has been commonly observed in many human cancers, and can be triggered by a variety of mechanisms including overexpression of upstream receptors, activating PI3KCA mutations, loss of PTEN function, and overexpression or activation of AKT [5]. For instance, the increased phosphorylations of AKT and mTOR have been observed in 80% of [7] and 47%?64% of GC patients [7-10]. Further investigations have demonstrated that the activation of the AKT/PI3K network can be attributed to overexpression of upstream receptors (20%?30%), PI3KCA activating mutations (4%?36%) [11,12] and PTEN loss (20%?36%) [11,13]. A recent study by Linos et al indicated that PTEN was lost in the majority of Her2 positive GC cases [14]. These observations provide a possible explanation for the observed clinical resistance of Her2 positive breast cancer patients to current anti-Her2 therapies, including Trastuzumab and lapatinib. This also suggests a rationale for the design of new combination therapies through dual targeting of the Her2 and PI3K?Akt?mTOR networks. Besides the involvement in resistance to anti-Her2 therapies, the importance of the PI3K?Akt?mTOR network in the resistance to chemotherapies in GC has been documented by a number of studies [12,15]. In one such study, reduction of basal AKT activity by ectopic expression of PTEN sensitized GC cells to anti-cancer chemotherapy agents. When primary tumor tissues from GC were tested for their chemotherapeutic sensitivity in vitro, the association between activated AKT and increased resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents including 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, mitomycin C, and cisplatin was found [16]. We previously reported the development of a novel AKT kinase inhibitor AZD5363, and found that cells with both PI3KCA mutation and PTEN loss were highly sensitive to treatment using AZD5363 [17]. In this study, we further investigated the correlation between the sensitivity of a panel of gastric cell lines to AZD5363 in vitro and their genetic aberrations. Using PDGCX models derived from patient GC tissues, we further confirmed a role for PI3KCA activating mutations and PTEN loss in sensitizing tumors to AKT inhibition. Materials and methods. Cell culture reagents, and proliferation assay. Human GC cell lines PAMC82 cells were obtained from Beijing tumor hospital (Beijing, China). GTL-16, 23132/87 cells were provided by AztraZeneca tissue culture unit (Alderley Park, UK). NCI-N87, SNU-1, SNU-5, SNU-16, HS746T and AGC were purchased from American type culture collection (ATCC, American). KATOIII and HGC27 were obtained from Europe collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, UK). NUGC-4, IM95 m, MKN-1, OCUM-1, MKN-74, AZ-521 cells were obtained from Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank (JCRB, Japanese). NUGC-3 cells were obtained from Beijing University (Beijing, China). SNU-261, SNU-484, SNU-601, SNU-620, SNU-638 and SNU-668 cells were obtained from Korean cell line bank. IM95 m and HS746T cells were cultured in DMEM medium with 10% FBS and 10 ug/ml insulin. OUCM-1 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 1% Na Pyruvate. All other cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 2?mM?L-Glutamine. All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. The structure and synthesis of AKT inhibitor AZD5363 [(S)-4-amino-N-[1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxypropyl]-1-(7H-pyrrolo [2, 3-d]pyrimidin 4-yl)piperidine-4-carboxamide has been described previously [17]. Cell growth rate was measured by a MTS assay. Briefly, cells seeded at 1000-2000/well density in 96 well plates were cultured overnight, and then treated with AZD5363 at different concentrations for 72?hrs. CellTiter 96\u00a2\u00e7 Aqueous One Solution Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. After 2?hours in culture the cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490?nm using Safire 2 plate-reader (Tecan, Switzerland). Patients and tumor samples. The present study included 116 patients with GC who underwent surgery between 2007 to 2011 at the Renji Hospital, Shanghai, China. All patients underwent radical surgical resection, followed by standard chemotherapy for the majority of the patients. Histologic subtype according to Lauren\u00a1\u00afs classification was determined after a review of tumor sections by two trained pathologists. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Renji Hospital. Tissue microarray construction. GC tissue samples were fixed in buffered 4% formalin for a minimum of 24?hours and embedded in paraffin. The construction of tissue microarray (TMA) follows standard procedures as previously described [18]. Immunohistochemistry (IHC). The slides were baked at 56\u00a1\u00c6C for 1?hour, then de-paraffinized in xylene and hydrated through graded series of alcohols. Antigen retrieval was done in pressure cooker for 5?min using Citrate pH6, Target Retrieval Solution (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). After cooling to room temperature, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by Peroxidase Blocking Reagent (Dako) for 5?minutes. The sections were then incubated with rabbit monoclonal antibody against PTEN (Cell Signaling Technology, USA) for 1?hour at room temperature. Then the secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Dako, Envision) was applied to the sections for 30?minutes at room temperature. After rinsed with TBST, the slides were treated with DAB substrate-chromagen (Dako), counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted with coverslips. Scoring was established as follows: 0, if absence of staining was observed; 1+, if the tumor cells had weak staining; 2+, if tumor cells had moderate staining; and 3+ if tumor cells had strong staining. Tumors with 1+, 2+, and 3+ expression were interpreted as positive and tumors with no expression (0 score) were interpreted as negative. Given the heterogeneity of protein expression in tumor cells, the highest scoring from either one of TMA cores was counted as the final result. To minimize impact of intratumoral heterogeneity, case-matched whole sections of negatively-scored patient TMA samples were re-evaluated by IHC. All slides were independently evaluated by two pathologists (X. Y. and L. Z.) who are blind to patients\u00a1\u00af clinical data. The two pathologists discussed and reached final consensus result for each case. Western blot analysis. Frozen tumor fragments were homogenized in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and then lysed in RIPA buffer (Pierce, #89901) containing Halt protease & phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Pierce,78447). Soluble proteins were quantified by BCA protein level detection kit (Pierce,#23227 ), then soluble proteins (80?\u00a5\u00ecg) subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Antibody incubation was conducted overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: phosphor-Akt (S473) (Dako, cat.M3628), phosphor-PRAS40(Tyr436) (Cell Signaling Technologies, cat.2997), Phospho-S6 Ribosomal protein (Ser235/236) (Cell Signaling Technologies, cat.2211), AKT (Cell Signaling Technologies, cat.9272), PRAS40(Cell Signaling Technologies, cat.2610), S6 Ribosomal Protein (54 D2) (Cell Signaling Technologies, cat 2317), and GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technologies, cat.2118). Secondary antibodies were applied and immunoreactive proteins were visualized using \u00a1\u00b0;SuperSignal West Dura\u00a1\u00b1; Extended Duration Substrate according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions (Thermo, #34076). Sanger sequencing. PCR was performed in a 25?\u00a5\u00ecL reaction mix containing 1\u00a1\u00bf AmpliTaq Gold\u00a2\u00e7 360 Master Mix (Life Technologies), 200?\u00a5\u00ecM of each primer, and 5?\u00a5\u00ecL of genomic DNA. PI3K, Braf and Kras genes were amplified using the following primers: PI3KCA exon 10 forward 5\u00a1\u00c7-GTCTTAGATTGGTTCTTTCCTG-3\u00a1\u00c7, PI3KCA exon 10 reverse 5\u00a1\u00c7-GCATTTAATGTGCCAACTACC-3\u00a1\u00c7; PI3KCA exon 21 forward 5\u00a1\u00c7- TTTGTCTACGAAAGCCTCTCTA-3\u00a1\u00c7, PI3KCA exon 21 reverse 5\u00a1\u00c7- CCATCACTTTTTCCTTCTCCAT-3\u00a1\u00c7. Braf exon 15 forward 5\u00a1\u00c7- TTCATAATGCTTGCTCTGATAGGAAAATG-3\u00a1\u00c7, Braf exon 15 reverse 5\u00a1\u00c7- GAACACTGATTTTTGTGAATACTGGGAACT-3\u00a1\u00c7, and Kras exon 2 forward 5\u00a1\u00c7- GTACTGGTGGAGTATTTGATAGTG-3\u00a1\u00c7, Kras exon 2 reverse 5\u00a1\u00c7-GAGAGTGAACATCATGGACCCTG-3\u00a1\u00c7. The PCR cycling conditions were: 10-min incubation at 95\u00a1\u00c6C, followed by 40?cycles of 94\u00a1\u00c6C for 30?s, 60\u00a1\u00c6C for 30?s, 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 60?s, and then a final incubation at 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 10?min. The resulting PCR products were digested with ExoSAP-IT reagent (Affymetrix, Cleveland, Ohio, USA), and then sequenced in forward and reverse directions with BigDye Terminator Kit (Life Technologies) and an ABI 3730XL DNA analyzer (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. The sequencing data were analyzed for mutations after assembly and quality calling with SeqScape sequence analysis software (version 2.5; Life Technologies). Allele specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR). Human PI3K Gene Mutation Fluorescence Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) diagnostic kit (Amoy Diagnostics, Xiamen, China) was used for the Pi3KCA mutation detection in this study. This kit detects the 5 most common Pi3KCA mutations: E542K, E545D, E545K, H1047R, H1047L. All experiments were performed following the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Briefly, 5?\u00a5\u00ecL DNA was added to 45?\u00a5\u00ecL of the PCR master mix for each assay, which contained PCR primers, fluorescent probes, PCR buffer, and DNA polymerase. The PCR cycling conditions were: 5-min incubation at 95\u00a1\u00c6C, followed by 15?cycles of 95\u00a1\u00c6C for 25?s, 64\u00a1\u00c6C for 20?s, 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 20?s, and then 26?cycles of 93\u00a1\u00c6C for 25?s, 60\u00a1\u00c6C for 35?s, 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 20?s. Fluorescent signal was collected from FAM and HEX channels. Genotypes were determined according to threshold cycles (Ct) as indicated in the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis was performed using the Agilent Human Genome 244?K Microarray Chip (Agilent Technologies) with pooled human genomic DNA (Promega) as a reference. Labeling, hybridization, washes, and data analysis were performed according to the protocol provided by Agilent (Protocol version 4.0, June 2006). Graphical overviews were obtained using the CGH Analytics software (version 3.5, Agilent Technologies). Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). MLPA assay was carried out according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions with the PTEN kit P225-A1 (MRC-Holland, Netherlands). Fragment analysis was performed with 1?\u00a5\u00ecl MLPA PCR products by caplillary electrophoresis on an ABI3730XL DNA analyzer and analyzed using Genotyper software v4.0 (Life technologies, USA). Each exon copy number of PTEN was determined by calculating ratio of normalized test and control peak heights in each run. In vivo efficacy studies using patient-derived GC xenograft (PDGCX) mouse models. Eight- to 10-week-old female nude (nu/nu) mice (Vital River, Beijing) were used for development of PDGCX mouse models and in vivo efficacy studies. All experiments using immunodeficient mice were carried out in accordance with the guidelines approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC). PDGCX mouse models were established by directly implanting fresh surgical tumor tissue into immunodeficient mice. Prior written informed consents were obtained from all patients who contribute his/her tumor tissues and the study protocol was approved by the local hospital ethics committee. After establishment and characterization of PDGCX models, PDGCX tissues were harvested and frozen in medium with 90% serum and 10% DMSO in liquid nitrogen. For the anti-tumor efficacy studies, PDGCX tissue fragments (~15?mm 3) were implanted subcutaneously via Trocar needle into female nude mice subcutaneously. Tumor-bearing mice with a tumor size range of 100 to 200?mm 3 were randomly divided into control and treatment groups (8 animals per group) for treatment. AZD5363 was solubilized in 10% DMSO 25%?w/v Kleptose HPB (Roquette) buffer and dosed by oral gavage. Taxotere (Sanofi-Aventis) solubilized in 2.6% ethanol was administrated by intravenous injection once weekly. For the combination treatment, Taxotere was injected one hour in the PDGCX model before the oral dose of AZD5363. The control group received the DMSO/Kleptose buffer alone, twice daily by oral gavage. Subcutaneous tumors in nude mice and mouse body weight were measured twice weekly. Tumor volumes were calculated by measuring 2 perpendicular diameters with calipers [formula: V=(length\u00a1\u00bfwidth 2)/2]. Percentage tumor growth inhibition [%TGI=1-(change of tumor volume in treatment group/change of tumor volume in control group)\u00a1\u00bf100] was used for the evaluation of antitumor efficacy. Statistical significance was evaluated using a one-tailed, two-sample t test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results. GC cells harboring PI3KCA mutations were selectively sensitive to the AKT inhibitor AZD5363. To explore the potential application of AZD5363 in GC, a panel of 22 GC lines was tested for anti-proliferative sensitivity using an in vitro cell growth assay. Cells seeded in 96 well plates were cultured overnight, and then treated with AZD5363 at different concentrations for 72?hrs. Cell growth rate was measured by a MTS assay. As shown in Table?1, 6 out of the 22 tested cell lines displayed sensitivity to AZD5363 with IC50\u00a1\u00afs lower than 3?\u00a5\u00ecM [17]. Further analysis of the known genetic lesions in the GC cell panel indicated that 4 of the sensitive cell lines harbored the PI3KCA E542K mutation, one of the major PI3KCA activating mutations reported previously [19]. Interestingly, HGC27, the most sensitive line amongst the 4 PI3KCA mutant cell lines, contained not only PI3KCA mutation, but also PTEN loss. As we reported recently [17], when nude mice bearing HGC27 xenograft tumors were treated with AZD5363, complete tumor regression was achieved. Together, these data suggest that activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by PI3KCA mutations or PTEN loss drives tumorigenesis in GC, potentially defining a new molecular segment for AKT-based targeted therapies. Prevalence of PI3KCA mutations and PTEN loss in Chinese GC. Next we sought to identify GC patients with both PI3KCA mutations and PTEN loss, who will benefit the most from AZD5363 therapy. The hotspot mutations of PI3K, Braf and Kras genes and loss of PTEN was screened in a cohort of 150 Chinese GC samples by using mutation specific PCR and IHC respectively. As shown in Table?2, PI3KCA mutations were identified in the samples from 4 patients (3 with grade 3 and 1 with grade 2 diseases), representing a mutation rate of 2.7% (4/150). Besides PI3K activation through mutation, loss of PTEN represents another mechanism through which the PI3K/AKT pathway can become activated. Thus, we also investigated the expression status of PTEN in GC. A total of 61 qualified tumor samples from the same cohort of Chinese GC were examined by IHC staining using an anti-PTEN antibody. As shown in Table?2 and Figure?1, the loss of PTEN protein expression was found in 23% (14/61) of the tested samples, consistent with the reported rate of 20% [20]. Further sequencing analysis of the 61 samples indicated that PTEN loss overlapped with Braf mutation in one case, but was mutually exclusive with PI3KCA and Kras mutations (Table?3). Anti-tumor efficacy of AZD5363 in gastric PDGCX mouse models with PI3KCA mutation or PTEN loss. The lack of GC patients with both PI3KCA mutations and PTEN loss and the high prevalence of PTEN loss observed in GC triggered us to investigate the response of GC with PTEN loss to AZD5363. However, due to the lack of GC cell lines with PTEN loss and wild-type PI3K, we screened 15 gastric PDGCX mouse models established from surgical samples of Chinese GC patients. The expression levels of PTEN protein were measured by IHC staining and genomic PTEN aberrations were detected by MLPA analysis respectively. PI3KCA hotspot mutations were screened by direct sequencing. As indicated in Table?4, SGC020, a PDGCX model with a PTEN exon 2-6 gene deletion and undetectable PTEN protein expression and SGC100, a PDGCX model harboring a PI3KCA H1047R activating mutation and positive PTEN staining, were both identified for AZD5363 anti-tumor efficacy study. As shown in Figure?2A, higher levels of basal phosphor AKT and phosphor S6 were detected by Western blot in SGC100 and SGC020 tumors compared to that in the SGC001 PDGCX tumors with PI3K and PTEN wild-type status, indicating the up-regulation of AKT signal pathway in SGC100 and SGC020 models. Next we tested the response of SGC100 and SGC020 models to AZD5363. As shown in Figure?2B and ?and2C,2C, AZD5363 single agent treatment resulted in 60% tumor growth inhibition in SGC100 model (P<0.0001) but had only marginal effects (23% tumor growth inhibition, p<0.002) in the PTEN null SGC020 model. AZD5363 treatment in this study was well tolerated and did not result in significant body weight loss. These data indicate that PI3KCA mutations, but not PTEN loss, predicate the sensitivity to AZD5363 in GC. Chemotherapy is the current standard of care for GC. In additional effort, we preformed in vitro combination of AZD5363 with the commonly used chemotherapy agents in GC including Taxotere, SN-38 and Oxaliplatin in a number of GC cell lines with both PI3KCA mutation and PTEN loss (HGC27), PI3KCA mutation alone, and PI3K and PTEN wild-type status. Our data showed that the combination of AZD5363 with Taxotere, SN-38 and Oxaliplatin resulted in additive or slightly synergistic effect regardless of the mutation status in PI3K gene (Additional file 1: Table S1). Previous reports have suggested a role for PTEN loss in chemotherapy resistance [15]. Therefore, we next tested whether PTEN loss contributed to Taxotere resistance, one of the major chemotherapy agents used clinically in GC [21]. As shown in Figure?2B, Taxotere at a human equivalent dose of 5?mg/kg weekly had no effect on tumor growth in the SGC020 model with PTEN loss. In contrast, combinations of AZD5363 and Taxotere resulted in significant tumor inhibition (67%, p<0.05) in the PDGCX model, supporting a potential combination strategy for the treatment of GC with PTEN loss. In addition, the induction of caspase3/7 by combination of AZD5363 with Taxotere, the hallmark of cell apoptosis, was observed in multiple tested cell lines, suggesting the anti-tumor effect of AZD5363 with Taxotere by induction of apoptotic cell death (Additional file 1: Table S1). Pharmacodynamic modulation of AKT signaling by AZD5363 correlates with anti-tumor activity. To understand the mechanism of AZD5363 anti-tumor efficacy and its combination with Taxotere in SGC020 and SGC100 models, tumor samples were collected two hours post-last dose of AZD5363. Tissues lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis of PRAS40 and S6 phosphorylation, both downstream targets of AKT signaling. As shown in Figure?3, AZD5363 single agent treatment led to up-regulated pAKT in both SGC100 and SGC020 PDGCX models, indicating the engagement of AZD5363 with its specific target [17]. It is noteworthy that the undetectable pAKT (S473) in the untreated SGC100 and SGC020 tumors was due to a shorter western blot exposure since very strong signals were detected in the AZD5363 treated samples. Interestingly, the suppression of AKT downstream signaling monitored by pPRAS40 (52%) and pS6 (42%) was only observed in the PI3KCA mutant PDGCX model (SGC100), but not in the PTEN null PDGCX model (SGC020), correlating with AZD5363 anti-tumor efficacy. Consistent with our recent observations in cell cultures (data not shown), Taxotere treatment led to a moderate increase of pPRAS40 (Figure?3C/?C/3D)3D) in SGC20 model and the addition of AZD5363 blocked this induction. These results further support the activation of AKT signaling as a resistance mechanism to chemotherapy agents, and strongly suggest AKT inhibition as a viable sensitization approach. Discussion. Emerging evidence supports a critical role for the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling network in both tumorigenesis and drug resistance. A number of novel small molecule inhibitors targeting PI3K, AKT and mTOR are at different stages of drug development for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors, including GC [22]. Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor approved for breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, has been tested in GC patients in a phase II and phase III trial. In the recent phase II trial, everolimus demonstrated anti-tumor activity with a response rate of 3.7% (2/44) and disease control rate (DCR) of 38.9% (17/44) [23]. Although the trial failed to achieve its primary objective (30% of 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate), the observed association between high expression of pS6 (Ser240/4) at baseline and higher DCR and prolonged PFS warrant further trials with a molecular stratification-based patient selection strategy. Recently we reported the development of AZD5363, a potent pan-AKT kinase inhibitor, which is currently undergoing phase I clinical investigation. Our previous results demonstrated that cancer cells harboring PI3KCA activating mutations, PTEN mutations (loss or mutations), or Her2 amplification were highly sensitive to AZD5363 [17]. This sensitivity was further confirmed in several xenograft tumor models. Interestingly, we found that HGC27, a GC cell line with PI3KCA mutation and PTEN loss was the most sensitive line amongst all those tested, both in vitro and in vivo. Because PTEN loss is more prevalent than PI3KCA mutations and the frequency of these concurrent aberrations is very low, it is intriguing to understand whether the loss of function of PTEN alone is sufficient to drive the response to AKT inhibition. PTEN phosphatase is a novel tumor suppressor and negatively regulates the PI3K/Akt signaling network [24]. PTEN functional loss can be attributed to inactivating gene mutations, chromosomal deletions and promoter methylation, all of which are implicated in multiple cancer types including GC [25]. In comparison to PI3KCA mutations, the lack of detectable PTEN protein expression by IHC staining was more frequently observed in GC with reported rates of between 20-36% [11,13]. However, the role of PTEN in driving cancer development and the response to agents targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway is yet to be fully understood. In this report, we screened 15 primary xenograft models derived from primary GC tumors and identified one model with PI3KCA activating mutation and another with undetectable PTEN expression. When treated with AZD5363, potent anti-tumor responses were observed in the PI3KCA mutant PDGCX model, consistent with the cell panel data. In contrast, no significant efficacy was observed in the PDGCX model with PTEN loss, suggesting a minor role for PTEN loss in driving tumorigenesis in GC. However, when a PTEN null PDGCX model was treated with a combination of AZD5363 and taxotere, a synergistic effect was achieved compared to treatment with either single agent. This is consistent with previous observations by us and others [17,26]. In the Her2 positive BT474 model, a combination of AZD5363 with Taxotere led to complete tumor regression. Similarly, Lin et al showed that administration of another AKT kinase inhibitor, GDC-0068, in combination with Taxotere induced tumor regression in the PC-3 prostate xenograft model with a homozygous deletion of PTEN, at doses where each single agent only caused modest tumor growth delay. To further understand the underlying molecular mechanism for the combination effect in the PTEN null PDGCX model (SGC020), pAKT modulation and downstream signaling was studied. Consistent with previous observations, increased AKT phosphorylation was observed following AZD5363 treatment, suggestive of target engagement. However, we did not observe anti-tumor efficacy using AZD5363 monotherapy, nor modulation of pPRAS40 and S6. The reason for the inability of single agent AZD5363 to elicit efficacy in a PDGCX model (SGC020) is not currently fully understood. As the tumor samples used for the pharmacodynamic study were collected after a multiple dosing regimen, we postulate that there may be dynamic subtleties within the AKT signaling pathway and that further study using a single dose of AZD5363 over a dynamic time course may provide additional insight. Consistent with our own results from cell culture studies (data not shown), the expression levels of pPRS40 and pS6 were moderately upregulated by Taxotere in a PDGCX SGC020 model and treatment with AZD5363 blocked this activation, suggesting a possible mechanism for the anti-tumor efficacy observed in the combination study. PI3KCA hotspot mutations in GC have been previously reported by several groups. Mutation frequencies range from 10.6%% to 15.9% [27,28] in Caucasian and 4.3% to 7.1% in Asian GC [12,29]. This apparent discrepancy between Western and Eastern populations may be due to geographical differences, as shown for the situation with EGFR mutation in lung cancer [30]. In a separate study we found that the mutations in a number of oncogenes, including PI3KCA mutations, are enriched in advanced stage and genomically unstable patients (manuscript in preparation). The low frequency (2.7%, 4/127) of PI3KCA mutation detected in our study may be due to the relatively small sample size related to disease stage and genomic instability status. The observations described in this study were supported by emerging data from our ongoing two AZD5363 phase I clinical trials [31]. As a monotherapy, AZD5363 was generally well tolerated when administrated using intermittent doses of 480?mg twice daily, with four days on and three days off. The pharmacokinetic studies indicated that exposures achieved in patients were comparable to those achieved at efficacious doses used in our preclinical animal studies. Reductions in pPRAS40 and pGSK3\u00a5\u00e2 in plucked hair and blood samples were observed in 30% of patients. To date, partial responses have been observed in two treated patients, harboring tumor mutations in either AKT1 or PI3KCA. Given the high prevalence of PTEN loss in gastric cancer, the synergistic combination effect of AZD5363 with Taxotere in the PTEN-loss primary model warrants further clinical trial for potential application of AKT inhibitors for the treatment of patients with PTEN null tumors. In conclusion, AZD5363, a potent and selective small molecule AKT inhibitor, demonstrates the effectiveness to suppress growth of PI3KCA mutant GC cells in vitro and PDGCX model in vivo. It reverses the de novo resistance to Taxotere in a PTEN loss PDGCX model. These results point out a potential new strategy for treatment of subsets of GC patients with AKT inhibitors.

                "text": "5-azacytidine reduces methylation, promotes differentiation and induces tumor regression in a patient-derived IDH1 mutant glioma xenograft\tSomatic mutations in Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are frequent in low grade and progressive gliomas and are characterized by the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) from \u00a5\u00e1-ketoglutarate by the mutant enzyme. 2-HG is an \u00a1\u00b0oncometabolite\u00a1\u00b1 that competitively inhibits \u00a5\u00e1-KG dependent dioxygenases resulting in various widespread cellular changes including abnormal hypermethylation of genomic DNA and suppression of cellular differentiation. Despite the growing understanding of IDH mutant gliomas, the development of effective therapies has proved challenging in part due to the scarcity of endogenous mutant in vivo models. Here we report the generation of an endogenous IDH1 anaplastic astrocytoma model which rapidly grows in vivo, produces 2-HG and exhibits DNA hypermethylation. Using this model, we have demonstrated the preclinical efficacy and mechanism of action of the FDA approved demethylating drug 5-azacytidine in vivo. Long term administration of 5-azacytidine resulted in reduction of DNA methylation of promoter loci, induction of glial differentiation, reduction of cell proliferation and a significant reduction in tumor growth. Tumor regression was observed at 14 weeks and subsequently showed no signs of re-growth at 7 weeks despite discontinuation of therapy. These results have implications for clinical trials of demethylating agents for patients with IDH mutated gliomas. INTRODUCTION. Gliomas are a classification of nervous system tumors arising from glial cells, the most common of which are astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, arising from astrocytes and oligodendroglia, respectively. The most aggressive glioma is the WHO grade IV astrocytoma, or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which can arise de novo (primary GBM) or can progress from a WHO grade II or III glioma (secondary or progressive GBM). Whole exome sequencing of GBMs revealed frequent mutations at the position 132 arginine residue in the catalytic domain of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) of progressive gliomas and targeted sequencing found additional mutations in the mitochondrial family member IDH2 [1, 2]. Remarkably, more than 70% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary GBMs were found to bear mutations in IDH1 or IDH2. Both the IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were highly conserved, confined to a single residue, R132 and R172, respectively, and most frequently a single allele was mutated with the wild type allele retained [1]. Since its identification as an oncogene in glioma, IDH mutations have been identified in a number of cancer types, including a large percentage of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes [3, 4] as well as a small percentage of prostate cancer [5], cholangiocarcinoma [6, 7], and chondrosarcoma [8]. Overall evidence suggests that gain-of-function IDH1 or IDH2 mutations affect one or several fundamental cellular processes that underlie several types of malignancies. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed the probable mechanism of this oncogene: IDH mutations alter the enzymatic function of the protein to produce D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) from \u00a5\u00e1-ketoglutarate (\u00a5\u00e1-KG) [9]. Normally not present in human cells at significant concentrations, 2-HG functions as an \u00a1\u00b0oncometabolite\u00a1\u00b1 that competitively inhibits several \u00a5\u00e1-KG dependent dioxygenases [10]. Of particular importance, 2-HG has been shown to inhibit both the TET family of 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases and the H3K9 demethylase KDM4C, leading to the accumulation of repressive histone and DNA methylation alterations and a subsequent transcriptional block of differentiation gene expression [11, 12]. It has recently been shown that IDH mutations alone are sufficient to induce a global hypermethylated phenotype that is characteristic of the gliomas with these mutations [12, 13]. Abnormal DNA hypermethylation has been recognized as a possible target in cancer and DNA methylation reducing drugs, including 5-azacytidine that was reported nearly 40 years ago [14]. 5-azacytidine is an analogue of cytidine and it is incorporated into DNA and RNA. At therapeutic doses, 5-azacytidine inhibits DNA methyltransferase leading to a reduction in DNA methylation. In particular, 5-azacytidine is a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), inducing ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the protein [15]. Unfortunately, despite the growing understanding of IDH mutant gliomas, the development of effective therapies has proved challenging. IDH mutant tumors do not adapt well to growth in culture, including \u00a1\u00aestem cell\u00a1\u00af media and endogenous mutant models remain scarce [16, 17]. Engineered cell lines have been useful in elucidating the complex network underlying IDH mutations but lack the appropriate genetic and mutational context found in patient derived IDH mutant gliomas. Patient derived endogenous IDH mutant models are therefore critical for the development and testing of therapies which target IDH driven oncogenenic pathways and mechanisms. Here we report the generation of an endogenous IDH1 anaplastic astrocytoma and the preclinical demonstration of efficacy and mechanism of 5-azacytidine in this model. Long term administration of 5-azacytidine resulted in inhibition of DNMT1, loss of methylation of key genomic markers, in vivo induction of differentiation, reduction of cell proliferation and a significantly reduced tumor growth. Tumor growth was essentially arrested at 14 weeks and subsequently showed no signs yet of re-growth after removal of the therapy. RESULTS. Establishment and serial passage of an IDH1 (R132H) anaplastic astrocytoma model. Tumor was obtained from the resection of an anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III) from an adult patient with a history of glioma who presented with a large right temporal lobe tumor. The patient had been previously diagnosed with a low grade astrocytoma (WHO grade II) after his initial craniotomy twelve years prior. The resected WHO grade III tumor was found to have a high degree of anaplasia but lacked areas of necrosis and vascular proliferation. Direct sequencing of IDH1 exon 4 demonstrated that the grade III tumor bore a heterozygous G395A (R132H) mutation (Figure ?(Figure1C),1C), validated by immunohistochemistry (Figure ?(Figure1B).1B). Fresh tissue was collected from the specimen and directly implanted subcutaneously into athymic nude mice. Additionally, neurosphere cultures from the same patient were attempted in multiple media conditions including serum-free media containing hFGF and hEGF, but these cells did not propagate. However, a first generation tumor quickly arose in the nude mouse approximately one month after implantation as a large, localized subcutaneous mass. The resulting IDH1 (R132H) tumor model was designated as JHH-273. Direct sequencing of the xenograft tissue revealed preservation of the IDH1 (G395A) mutation, but revealed a loss of the wild type copy (Figure ?(Figure1C).1C). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated strong IDH1 (R132H) expression throughout the tissue (Figure ?(Figure1B).1B). All subsequent serial passages have retained the hemizygous IDH1 (R132H) mutation and exhibit robust expression of the mutant protein. Xenografts show histopathological similarity and diffuse growth pattern. Histopathological analysis of H&E samples obtained from the patient's recurrent tumor sample and subsequently xenograft tissue showed that both the flank and orthotopic xenografts maintain histopathological similarity to the patient tumor and maintain morphological characteristics of anaplastic astrocytomas (Figure ?(Figure1A).1A). The patient's recurrent tumor was a cellular infiltrating astrocytoma with scattered gemistocytic cells as well as rare tumor giant cells. Scattered mitotic figures were identified consistent with the diagnosis of an anaplastic astrocytoma. Immunostaining for mutant IDH1 was strongly and diffusely positive. JHH-273 xenografts maintained many of the features of the primary tumor including a typical astrocytic morphology as well as scattered tumor giant cells, mixed with vascular, stromal, and skeletal muscle elements characteristic of this anatomical site. Intracranial injections showed infiltrative growth throughout the cortex and deep grey matter structures (data not shown). JHH-273 grows in vivo but not in vitro. The JHH-273 model grows rapidly in the flank (Figure ?(Figure2A).2A). Serially transplantable flank xenografts reach maximum size (2.0 cm 3) approximately 7 weeks after implantation and grow as dense, localized, hypercellular masses. Production of 2-HG from \u00a5\u00e1-KG is a hallmark of IDH mutations and its accumulation is believed to underlie the pathogenesis of IDH mutations. Therefore, we investigated whether our patient-derived model produces 2-HG. LC/MS analysis was performed on snap frozen tissue from well-established flank xenograft (passage 7). JHH-273 produced high levels of 2-HG which correspond to the endogenous levels reported in IDH1/2 mutant gliomas (Figure ?(Figure2B).2B). In contrast, 2-HG was nearly undetectable in tissue obtained from IDH1 wild type glioma controls. JHH-273 CpG hypermethylation and by 5-azacytidine treatment in vivo. Recent data has shown that one consequence of IDH mutation is the induction of global DNA hypermethylation which is believed to contribute to tumor formation and maintenance [12, 21, 22]. In order to determine the methylation status of JHH-273, we performed pyrosequencing analysis of bisulfate-converted genomic DNA at five genetic loci. Targets were selected based on the reported frequency of hypermethylation in IDH1 (R132H) primary tissue and engineered cell systems as well as their known functional impact in tumoriogenesis or tumor maintenance [21-31]. The analysis was performed using genomic DNA obtained from both early and late passage xenograft tissue (passages 1, 7 and 10) as well as two unrelated IDH1 (R132H) anaplastic astrocytoma samples and three IDH1 (WT) glioma primary patient samples as controls. The original patient tumor exhibited high degrees of CpG methylation at three of the five loci (the RBP1 locus did not amplify), which was maintained in the xenograft tissue at all passages analyzed (Figure ?(Figure3A).3A). The high levels of CpG methylation were consistent with other primary patient IDH1 (R132H) anaplastic astrocytoma samples. In contrast, wild type IDH1 gliomas exhibited low levels of methylation at all targets analyzed, consistent with reported data. Of note, although SOX9 hypermethylation in IDH mutant gliomas has been reported in several studies, we did not detect significant methylation in either primary tissue sample or xenograft. Overall, JHH-273 reflects the hypermethylated genomic landscape of the original patient tumor and characteristic of an IDH1 (R132H) anaplastic astrocytoma. To determine whether hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine is able to reverse methylation of the JHH-273 tumors in vivo, we analyzed CpG methylation of flank tumors following treatment with one cycle of 5-azacytidine (1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg). 5-azacytidine was able to reduce CpG hypermethylation at four of the five targets analyzed in a dose specific manner (Figure ?(Figure3B).3B). Although a significant tumor regression was observed in the high dose treatment group, this was accompanied with significant toxicity (data not shown). Long term treatment with 5-azacytidine reduces tumor growth in an IDH1 mutant model. To extend the relative exposure time of JHH-273 tumor to 5-azacytidine, serial passage of flank tumors from treated mice was performed using the strategy outlined in Figure ?Figure4.4. A moderate reduction of tumor burden was observed within one treatment cycle, but this decrease was not significant (p=0.27) (Figure ?(Figure5A).5A). Following passage of 5-azacytidine treated flank tumors, a second cycle of treatment with the 5-azacytidine was resumed as before and continued until maximum tumor burden was reached. 5-azacytidine significantly reduced tumor burden by the fourth week of Cycle 2 (p<0.01), and the difference between untreated and treated increased throughout the treatment period (Figure ?(Figure5B).5B). During passage of tumor after Cycle 2, the tissue was found to be unusually firm and encapsulated by gelatinous tissue. Enzymatically disassociated fractions of the tumor were found to be less than 10% viable by Trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). 5-azacytidine serially treated tumors were implanted for a third time into two groups of athymic nude mice (Cycle 3). To assess the durability of the therapeutic response, treatment was withdrawn in one group. Significant tumor regression was observed in both groups, including the treatment withdrawn group, suggesting a durable therapeutic response of 5-azacytidine (Figure ?(Figure5C5C). Treatment with 5-azacytidine induces differentiation and reduces the proliferative index. Intracellular 5-azacytidine activity was confirmed by DNMT1 expression in tissue from untreated and 5-azacytidine treated tumors (Cycles 1 and 2). DNMT1 is expressed at high levels in untreated tumors but expression of the protein is robustly inhibited following treatment with 5-azacytidine. DNMT1 protein was undetectable after one treatment cycle of 5-azacytidine (Figure ?(Figure6A6A). Prior studies had proposed that the IDH mutation inhibits DNA and histone demethylation leading to a block in cellular differentiation [24]. Additionally in a study published in this issue, treatment of endogenous IDH1 mutant glioma cell lines with hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine was found to drive differentiation in vitro [32]. To test whether reduction of hypermethylation by 5-azacytidine leads to an increase in cellular differentiation in vivo, immunoblotting was performed for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in tumors treated with 5-azacytidine. GFAP expression was undetectable in the untreated tumors, confirming the undifferentiated phenotype of IDH (R132H) tumors. Following one cycle of 5-azacytidine treatment, GFAP expression was robustly increased and protein levels were maintained throughout the second treatment cycle. To validate these findings, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. Compared with untreated tissue, 5-azacytidine treatment markedly increased the fraction of GFAP-positive cells (Figure ?(Figure6C).6C). These results confirm that IDH mutations plays an active role in repressing cellular differentiation, a deficiency which is reversible with long term treatment with hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine. To test whether 5-azacytidine induced differentiation translated to a decrease in proliferation, tumors from 5-azacytidine treated mice were stained with the proliferation marker Ki-67. 5-azacytidine treatment significantly reduced the fraction of Ki-67 positive cells in a time dependent manner, with the greatest decrease in proliferation during the 7 to 14 week period of Cycle 2 (Figure ?(Figure6D6D). DISCUSSION. Somatic mutations in IDH are found in a high percentage of low grade and progressive gliomas. IDH mutant gliomas are associated with a pro-neural gene expression profile, a characteristic pattern of DNA hypermethylation and a signature of repressive histone methylation [12]. A mechanism by which the 2-HG produced by IDH mutations are believed to promote tumorigenesis is by blocking cellular differentiation via hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes involved in differentiation [11-13, 21, 22]. The current therapy for low grade gliomas is surgical resection followed by monitoring with periodic MRI scans. Unfortunately, the majority of these tumors recur or progress to a high grade glioma. Although repeat surgery and additional treatment with radiation can temporarily slow tumor growth, if the gliomas progress to high grade no curative therapy is available. Median survival for grade II astrocytoma (fibrillary or diffuse astrocytoma) is approximately 5 to 7 years and for grade III astrocytoma (anaplastic), median survival is 4 to 5 years [33]. In this work, we report the first in vivo model of a patient derived IDH mutant anaplastic astrocytoma, JHH-273. This model was established after many attempts, which underscores the difficulty most labs have had at growing IDH mutant astrocytomas. The goal of establishing the xenografts was to enhance translational studies with more accurate models harboring relevant mutations that developed during the course of human tumorigenesis. Importantly, we show in that IDH1 (R132H) expression is stable through multiple passages, 2-HG is robustly produced in the tissue, and the model bears a hypermethylated CpG phenotype characteristic of IDH1 mutant glioma. Once evidence emerged that hypermethylation was a likely oncogenic mechanism of IDH mutations, demethylating agents became an attractive choice for translational investigation. When 5-azacytidine treatment was first tested in the JHH-273 model, a decrease in methylation was observed in a dose specific manner but was associated with only marginal reduction of tumor burden. We were able to achieve a significant in vivo response by lowering drug dosing and extending the relative exposure time of tumor to drug by passaging pre-treated tumor tissue into treatment naive mice. Short term 5-azacytidine treatment (1 cycle, 7 weeks) perhaps started to slow tumor growth, but by doubling treatment time, we were able to achieve tumor regression. Treatment with 5-azacytidine for 2 cycles elicited a durable treatment response as treatment withdrawal for an additional 6 weeks did not produce any visible signs of tumor re-growth (although we continue to monitor the mice). At the end of 2 treatment cycles, the tumors had changed dramatically in appearance with the presence of hard fibrous tissue and less than 10% cell viability. Additionally, with 7 weeks of treatment 5-azacytidine drives cellular differentiation to the astrocytic linage as seen by increase in GFAP expression, further underscoring the reversal of the presumed mechanism of mutant IDH1 oncogenesis. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that demethylating drugs may promote re-expression of previously silenced Polycomb controlled genes and subsequently activate genes involved in differentiation [21, 34]. The observed induction of cellular differentiation and subsequent reduction in proliferation following treatment with a hypomethylating agent in IDH mutant glioma is surprisingly consistent with an independent study that is simultaneously reported in this journal [32]. In this companion work, decitabine, a closely related demethylating agent, was found to preferentially induce differentiation in IDH mutant glioma cells but not in wild type cells. This work showed very similar mechanistic results to this study, and since both the drug and the models utilized are independent, the collective evidence supports the hypothesis that the gene expression reactivated by demethylating agents is sufficient to produce terminal differentiation in the self renewing malignant cells of the tumor. 5-azacytidine is currently FDA approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and well tolerated in patients. Its close structural analogue, decitabine, can effectively cross the blood brain barrier in laboratory animals [35]. Experimentally, pre-treatment of cells with transient, low dose exposure of 5-azacytidine has been shown to decrease tumorigenicity and percentage of stem-like cells in several cancer models [36]. In addition to considering 5-azacytidine or decitabine for recurrent or high grade IDH mutant glioma, 5-azacytidine therapy may also be useful as a maintenance therapy following tumor resection. Due to the infiltrative growth pattern of astrocytoma, complete resection is nearly impossible and the remaining tumor frequently recurs, often as a higher grade glioma. Low-dose treatment with 5-azacytidine following resection may drive the remaining mutant IDH glioma cells into differentiation, thereby delaying recurrence. This work supports the further investigation of demethylating drugs such as 5-azacytidine for its use against mutant IDH gliomas both in the laboratory and in clinical trials. Although it is very likely that these drugs have the potential to help patients with IDH1 mutant gliomas, the optimal demethylating drug, patient population, dosing strategy, delivery and drug combinations have yet to be determined. METHODS. Flank xenograft establishment and passage. A fresh tissue sample was obtained during the resection of an anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III) from a male patient. The tissue was implanted subcutaneously into a 4?6-week old female athymic nude mice (NCI-Frederick) under a Johns Hopkins approved protocol as previously described [18]. Briefly, the freshly harvested tumor tissue was mechanically dissociated using scalpels, mixed with an equal volume of growth factor?reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences, CA), and injected subcutaneously into the flanks of athymic nude mice (0.2cc/flank). Xenografts were passaged in a similar fashion and animals were monitored frequently for signs of tumor growth. All animal protocols and procedures were performed in accordance with the Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Orthotopic tumors were established using cells obtained from flank tissue disassociated using a 2:1 ratio of collagenase (10mg/mL, Invitrogen, NY) and hyaluronidase (1000 units/mL, Sigma Aldrich, MO). Cross-sectional samples were obtained at each passage and fixed in formalin. The samples were then embedded in paraffin and stained by H&E or used for immunohistochemistry. The IDH1 (R132H) mutation was validated by direct sequencing for each passage. Sequencing of IDH1. Genomic DNA was isolated from patient tissue and flank xenografts using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR and sequencing was conducted as previously described [19]. Briefly, 60 ng of genomic DNA was added to a standard PCR reaction to amplify a portion of exon 4 of IDH1 (forward 5'-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTTGAGCTCTATATGCCATCACTGC 3', reverse 5'-CAATTTCATACCTTGCTTAATGGG-3'). The PCR product was purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, CA) and submitted for sequencing (Genewiz, NJ) using targeted primers (forward 5'-CGGTCTTCAGAGAAGCCATT-3', and reverse 5'-GCAAAATCACATTATTGCCAAC-3'). LC/MS. 2-hydroxyglutarate levels were analyzed from snap frozen flank xenograft samples. Prior to extraction, frozen samples were thawed in a water bath at ambient temperature. Tissue homogenates were prepared at a concentration of 200 mg/mL in methanol. A 10 \u00a5\u00ecL aliquot of homogenized tissue was added to a borosilicate glass test tube (13\u00a1\u00bf100 mm) containing 10 \u00a5\u00ecL of acetonitrile solution and 2-phosphonomethyl pentanedioic acid (1 mg/mL), which was used as the internal standard. The tube was mixed vigorously and evaporated under nitrogen gas at 4\u00a1\u00c6C until completely dried. After the samples were dried, 100 \u00a5\u00ecl of acetonitrile and 100 \u00a5\u00ecL of N-tert-Butyldimethysilyl-N-methyltrifluoro-acetamide were added sequentially. The tubes were incubated at 80\u00a1\u00c6C for 1 hour then diluted 1:10 with acetonitrile. 100 \u00a5\u00ecl of the top layer was transferred to a 250-\u00a5\u00ecL polypropylene autosampler vial sealed with a Teflon crimp cap. 10 \u00a5\u00ecL of each sample was injected onto the LC/MS/MS for quantitative analysis using a temperature-controlled autosampling device operating at 10\u00a1\u00c6C. Chromatographic analysis was performed using an ACQuity \u00a2\u00e2 UItra Performance LC (Waters, MA). Separation of the analyte from potentially interfering material was achieved at ambient temperature using X-Terra \u00a2\u00e7 RP18 column (20 \u00a1\u00bf 2.1 mm, Waters, MA) packed with a 3.5 \u00a5\u00ecm RP 18 material (Milford, MA). The mobile phase used for the chromatographic separation was composed of acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid and 2mM ammonium acetate in water (80:20, v/v) and delivered using an isocratic flow rate of 0.3 mL/minute. The column effluent was monitored using a QTRAP R 5500 mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, MA). The instrument was equipped with an electrospray interface, operated in a positive mode and controlled by the Analyst 1.5.1 software. The mass spectrometry was programmed to monitor the following MRM's 491.0 to 359 for 2HG and 683.0 to 551.4 for the IS. Samples were quantified over the assay range of 0.02 to 2 \u00a5\u00ecg/mL. The standard curve of ratio response (analyte peak area/IS peak area) vs. concentration was plotted using linear regression with 1/x weighting for the data analyzed. Histology and Immunohistochemistry. Paraffin-embedded (5 micron) sections were deparaffinized, and stained with either hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or immunohistochemical stains as specified. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed for 36 minutes at 98\u00a1\u00c6C in target retrieval buffer. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using antibodies specific for IDH1 (R132H) (Dianova, DIAH09LM), GFAP (Dako, Z0334) and Ki-67 (Ventana, 790-4286). Immunostaining was visualized using the ultraView DAB detection system (Ventana Medical Systems, AZ). Pyrosequencing of target genes. Bisulfite conversion was carried out using EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, CA) with 1\u00a5\u00ecg genomic DNA. PCR was carried out using PyroMark PCR kit (Qiagen, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were run in a 25 \u00a5\u00ecL reaction with 2.5 \u00a5\u00ecL of primer reconstituted according to manufacturer's instructions. The thermocycler conditions are an initial activation step of 95\u00a1\u00c6C for 15 minutes, 45 cycles of 94\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 seconds, 56\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 seconds, and 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 30 seconds, and a final extension of 72\u00a1\u00c6C for 10 minutes. Controls included 100%, 50%, and 0% human methylated control DNA (Zymo Research Corp, CA), and a no-template control. Samples plus controls were amplified using primer kits Hs_PYCARD_03_PM, Hs_RBP1_02_PM, Hs_MGMT_01_PM, Hs_SOX9_08_PM, and Hs_BMP4_02_PM (Qiagen, CA). Amplified DNA was then pyrosequenced using the PyroMark CpG Assay kit (Qiagen, CA) on the PyroMark 24 system (Qiagen, CA). Bisulfite conversion, PCR amplification and pyrosequencing was performed at the Genetic Resources Core Facility, Johns Hopkins Institute of Genetic Medicine, Baltimore, MD. Therapeutic administration of 5-azacytidine to JHH-273 flank bearing mice. Female, athymic nude mice aged 4-6 weeks were implanted with the JHH-273 tumor line as described above. Five days after implantation, mice received daily i.p. injections of 5-azacytidine (Sigma Aldrich, MO; 3 mg/kg) diluted in sterile water for five days followed by a two day rest period. Treatment continued until tumors reached maximum allowable size (Cycle 1). Following sacrifice, tumors were harvested and passaged individually into another set of female athymic nude mice, identically as before. 5-azacytidine treatment was resumed immediately after tumor implantation and continued until tumors reached maximum allowable size (Cycle 2). Following the second cycle of treatment, tumors were again resected and passaged into two groups of mice. To assess the durability of the therapeutic response, 5-azacytidine treatment was withdrawn in one group of pre-treated animals and resumed immediately in the other (Cycle 3). Treatment strategy is outlined in Figure ?Figure4.4. Tumors were measured weekly and volume was calculated as: H\u00a1\u00bfL\u00a1\u00bfW (mm 3). Immunoblotting. Protein lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer and immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described [20]. Briefly, protein lysates were obtained from freshly resected flank tumors using RIPA buffer (ThermoScientific, MA) containing Halt protease inhibitor cocktails (Pierce, IL) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Lysates (50 \u00a5\u00ecg) were heated to 95\u00a1\u00c6C in Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min and separated on SDS polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) in Western transfer buffer [25 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mmol/L glycine, and 20% methanol]. For Western blot analysis, membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (1\u00a1\u00bf TBS, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C with antibodies against GFAP (Cell Signaling Technology, MA), or DNMT1 (New England Biolabs, MA). After washing, membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody detection was achieved by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pierce, IL). Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using a Student t-test for comparisons between the treatment groups. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Acknowledgments. We thank Dr. Michelle A.

                "text": "Modelling vemurafenib resistance in melanoma reveals a strategy to forestall drug resistance\tMutational activation of BRAF is the most prevalent genetic alteration in human melanoma, with \u00a1\u00c3 50% of tumours expressing the BRAF(V600E) oncoprotein 1,2. Moreover, the marked tumour regression and improved survival of late-stage BRAF-mutated melanoma patients in response to treatment with vemurafenib demonstrates the essential role of oncogenic BRAF in melanoma maintenance 3,4. However, as most patients relapse with lethal drug-resistant disease, understanding and preventing mechanism(s) of resistance is critical to providing improved therapy 5. Here we investigate the cause and consequences of vemurafenib resistance using two independently derived primary human melanoma xeno-graft models in which drugresistanceisselected by continuous vemurafenib administration. In one of these models, resistant tumours show continued dependency on BRAF(V600E) \u00a1\u00e6 MEK \u00a1\u00e6 ERK signalling owing to elevated BRAF(V600E) expression. Most importantly, we demonstrate that vemurafenib-resistant melanomas become drug dependent for their continued proliferation, such that cessation of drug administration leads to regression of established drug-resistant tumours. We further demonstrate that a discontinuous dosing strategy, which exploits the fitness disadvantage displayed by drug-resistant cells in the absence of the drug, forestalls the onset of lethal drug-resistant disease. These data highlight the concept that drug-resistant cells may also display drug dependency, such that altered dosing may prevent the emergence of lethal drug resistance. Such observations may contribute to sustaining the durability of the vemurafenib response with the ultimate goal of curative therapy for the subset of melanoma patients with BRAF mutations. To model the emergence of drug resistance, we developed an early passage, vemurafenib-naive, primary human-patient-derived xeno-graft (PDX) BRAF T1799A-mutated melanoma model, HMEX1906 (Supplementary Table1), which was continuously treated with vemurafenib in immunocompromised mice. This system models the emergence of drug-resistant melanoma in response to drug exposures similar to those in patients. Furthermore, this model permits the sampling of serial biopsies from a single tumour, allowing us to investigate the presence of more than one clonally derived mechanism of resistance within the original tumour. HMEX1906 melanomas are highly sensitive to vemurafenib, with tumour regression observed at clinically relevant drug exposures (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a?c). To generate drug-resistant melanomas, tumour-bearing mice were dosed for 8 weeks with 45 mg kg ?1 vemurafenib. This dose resulted in over 80% inhibition of phosphorylated (p) ERK1 and ERK2 (also known as MAPK3 and MAPK1, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 1d) for up to 24 h, a degree of inhibition previously associated with tumour regression in clinical trials 4,5. Approximately 56 days after dosing was initiated, drug-resistant tumours emerged in 2 out of 10 mice (Fig. 1b). One such tumour (45V-RT) was harvested, fragmented and re-implanted into a new cohort of mice, which were then treated with 45 mg kg ?1 vemurafenib to generate drug-resistant tumours for exploration of mechanisms of resistance (Supplementary Fig. 1e, f). Next, we assessed differences in the response to vemurafenib between sensitive parental HMEX1906 and resistant 45V-RT tumours by measuring pERK1 and pERK2 levels 3 h after drug dosing (Fig. 1c). Whereas pERK1/2 and the expression of ERK1/2 target genes such as DUSP6 and SPRY4 were strongly suppressed in sensitive parental HMEX1906 tumours, they were largely unaffected in drug-resistant 45V-RT tumours (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Analysis of fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of eight resistant tumours over a 72-h time course revealed higher pERK1/2 levels compared to parental tumours 30 min after drug administration, with the nadir of pERK1/2 consistently higher than that observed in parental drug-sensitive tumours (Fig. 1d). Hence, resistant tumours do respond to drug treatment, but the degree of pERK1/2 inhibition was less profound compared to sensitive melanomas. These data suggest that BRAF(V600E) remains essential for sustaining MEK\u00a1\u00e6ERK pathway activation. One explanation for such observations is that BRAF was mutated to a vemurafenib-resistant state. Alternatively, upstream (for example, NRAS) or downstream (for example, MEK1; also known as MAP2K1) nodes in the RAS\u00a1\u00e6RAF\u00a1\u00e6MEK\u00a1\u00e6ERK pathway may be mutationally activated, as described recently 6,7. However, exome sequence analysis failed to reveal secondary mutations in the coding sequences of BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS or MEK1 in resistant tumours (data not shown). To determine whether BRAF overexpression or alternative splicing might account for vemurafenib resistance 8,9, BRAF(V600E) expression was measured in sensitive and resistant tumours. Immunoblot analysis indicated that both sensitive and resistant tumours expressed an 85 kilodalton (kDa) isoform of BRAF(V600E) (Fig. 2a). However, compared to sensitive tumours, all nine resistant tumours expressed elevated levels of BRAF messenger RNA and protein, with the 45V-RT5 tumour showing the highest levels (Fig. 2a, b). Taqman analysis of BRAF copy number indicated that the parental HMEX1906 tumour contained approximately six copies of BRAF T1799A. Although eight out of nine of the resistant tumours showed no additional BRAF copy number gain, the 45V-RT5 tumour was found to have ~14 copies of BRAF T1799A (Fig. 2c), consistent with BRAF amplification as a mechanism of vemurafenib resistance 9. These data suggest that the parental tumour contains heterogeneous vemurafenib-resistant cells, all of which show elevated BRAF mRNA/protein expression but only a subpopulation further amplify BRAF 10. Finally, we did not detect evidence of alternatively spliced isoforms of BRAF(T1799A) or BRAF(V600E) by mRNA or protein analysis 8. To confirm elevated levels of BRAF protein as a resistance mechanism, melanoma cell lines were derived from the parental HMEX1906 and the vemurafenib-resistant 45V-RT tumour (Fig. 1b). We noted difficulty in establishing cultures of drug-resistant cells unless the media contained ~50 nM vemurafenib. This observation is consistent with reports that vemurafenib-resistant variants of BRAF(V600E)-expressing M288, SK-MEL28 or M14 melanoma cell lines require vemurafenib for continuous proliferation 11. In addition, HMEX1906 melanoma cells grown in the absence of drug and 45V-RT melanoma cells grown in the presence of drug showed similar morphology (Fig. 3a, top middle and bottom right). However, culturing 45V-RT melanoma cells in the absence of vemurafenib for 10 days resulted in marked alterations in cell morphology. Cells appeared rounded, refractile and spindle shaped, features characteristic of cells with elevated RAF\u00a1\u00e6MEK\u00a1\u00e6ERK signalling 12?14 (Fig. 3a, middle). Furthermore, a cell-proliferation assay conducted with a range of drug concentrations indicated a bell-shaped response to vemurafenib, with peak proliferation in the resistant cells occurring at 50 nM vemurafenib, and with diminished cell proliferation noted at lower and higher drug concentrations (Fig. 3b). A similar curve was observed with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, with a shift in peak proliferation consistent with the compound\u00a1\u00afs decreased potency. Analysis of BRAF(V600E)\u00a1\u00e6MEK\u00a1\u00e6ERK signalling indicated that reducing the concentration of vemurafenib led to elevated pERK1/2 levels in the resistant 45V-RT cells. Moreover, the level of pERK1/2 in resistant 45V-RT cells cultured in 50 nM vemurafenib was similar to that detected in parental HMEX1906 cells cultured in the absence of vemurafenib (Fig. 3c, dotted line). After 10 days of culture in the presence of 50 nM vemurafenib, 45V-RT cells showed elevated BRAF(V600E) protein expression similar to resistant tumours in mice (Figs 2a and ?and3d).3d). To confirm that resistant cells remained oncogene dependent, we inhibited BRAF(V600E) expression by RNA interference (using siBRAF short interfering RNA). Complete knockdown of BRAF(V600E) expression in resistant 45V-RT cells resulted in suppression of proliferation; hence, resistant cells remain dependent on oncogenic BRAF(V600E) signalling for proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). However, partial suppression of BRAF(V600E) to levels detected in parental cells (Fig. 3f) re-sensitized resistant cells to both vemurafenib and AZD6244 (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 3c). These data confirm that resistant tumour cells remain oncogene dependent and that drug resistance is due to elevated expression of BRAF(V600E). Moreover, the fitness benefit given to resistant cells by elevated BRAF(V600E) in the presence of vemurafenib becomes a fitness deficit when the drug is removed. To test this hypothesis, we expressed a conditional BRAF(V600E)?oestrogen receptor (ER; also known as ESR1) fusion protein in parental HMEX1906 cells, such that addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) leads to increased BRAF(V600E) signalling 12?14 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). As predicted, elevated BRAF(V600E) activity in the parental cells led to increased pERK levels but decreased proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). These data indicate that HMEX1906 cells are responding to both the quality and quantity of BRAF(V600E)\u00a1\u00e6MEK\u00a1\u00e6ERK signalling such that either reduced (in response to vemurafenib) or enhanced (in response to BRAF(V600E)?ER activation) pathway activation has a deleterious effect on their proliferation 12?14. To test whether observations made with cultured melanoma cells are relevant to tumorigenesis in vivo, we evaluated the effects of cessation of drug administration on vemurafenib-resistant tumours in mice. Initially we noted that significantly fewer drug-resistant tumours grew in vehicle-treated mice as compared to vemurafenib-treated mice (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, cessation of drug treatment of mice carrying vemufarenib-resistant melanomas led to clear signs of regression within 10 days after drug withdrawal (Fig. 4b). Consistent with in vitro observations, immunoblot analysis of melanoma specimens collected by serial FNAs from each tumour indicated that drug withdrawal led to elevated pMEK1/2\u00a1\u00e6pERK1/2 signalling, concomitant with tumour regression (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 5a). However, following an initial period of tumour regression after drug withdrawal, tumours showed re-growth?at which time pERK1/2 levels in the vehicle-treated tumours (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 5a, light blue bars) returned to their original levels (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 5a, dark blue bars). These data support the hypothesis that vemurafenib-resistant tumours suffer a fitness deficit in the absence of vemurafenib. On the basis of molecular analysis of the HMEX1906 model, we propose that resistance to BRAF inhibitors is due to increased BRAF(V600E) expression. To expand on observations made using the HMEX1906 model, we tested whether this phenomenon might hold true in additional models of vemurafenib resistance. First, we assessed the effect of vemurafenib withdrawal from SK-MEL239-C3 cells, in which resistance is due to expression of a 61-kDa splice variant of BRAF(V600E) (Supplementary Fig. 6b) 8. In a clonogenicity assay, we observed significantly fewer SK-MEL239-C3 cell colonies when cultured in the absence of vemurafenib (Supplementary Fig. 6c). In addition, we tested the effects of vemurafenib withdrawal from a second BRAF-mutated PDX (M120214) (Supplementary Table 1) isolated from a patient whose melanoma already showed vemurafenib resistance. This PDX was established in mice dosed with 45 mg kg ?1 vemurafenib (twice daily) immediately after tumour implantation. After 59 days of drug treatment, drug administration was ceased in four out of five tumour-bearing mice. All four tumours demonstrated clear signs of drug-withdrawal-induced tumour regression (Supplementary Fig. 6c), consistent with observations in the HMEX1906 model (Fig. 4c). These models support the observation that vemurafenib-resistant 45V-RT melanomas show a fitness deficit in the absence of vemurafenib. One prediction of this model is that, whereas continuous vemurafenib treatment will inevitably select for drug-resistant tumour cells, discontinuous dosing would create a disadvantageous environment for drug-resistant cells?thereby forestalling the onset of lethal drug resistance. To that end, mice were implanted with parental HMX1906 tumours and treated either continuously or intermittently (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off) with 15 mg kg ?1 vemurafenib (twice daily), such that mice on the intermittent dosing schedule received the same or a greater cumulative drug dose as mice on the continuous schedule over the entire treatment period. As predicted, mice continuously dosed with vemurafenib developed lethal drug-resistant disease within 100 days after initiation of drug administration. By contrast, none of the mice on the intermittent dosing schedule developed drug-resistant disease over the course of 200 days (Figs 1b and ?and4d,4d, and Supplementary Fig. 5b). In addition, a similar intermittent versus continuous dosing experiment was conducted in another early passage PDX expressing BRAF(V600E), HMEX2613 (Supplementary Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table1). In this case, the intermittent dosing schedule was individualized for each tumour-bearing mouse. As in the HMEX1906 model, HMEX2613 tumours treated continuously with 45 mg kg ?1 vemurafenib (twice daily) developed lethal drug-resistant disease, whereas mice dosed intermittently with vemurafenib did not (Fig. 4e). Irrespective of the underlying mechanism of resistance in the two models, these results indicate that intermittent dosing significantly delays the onset of drug resistance by exploiting the fitness deficit shown by drug-resistant tumour cells in the absence of drug. Furthermore, although we observed that counter-selection against resistant cells by cessation of vemurafenib administration allowed drug-sensitive tumours to restart their growth, these cells remained responsive to the antitumour effects of vemurafenib re-administration. Although vemurafenib can inhibit BRAF(V600E)\u00a1\u00e6MEK\u00a1\u00e6ERK signalling sufficiently to elicit marked tumour regression, the durability of vemurafenib responses is limited by acquired drug resistance 6?9,15,16. Our results suggest that the proliferation of vemurafenib-resistant cells can be dependent on the continuous presence of the drug, such that tumour growth is inhibited after cessation of drug administration. These data are consistent with previous results indicating that both normal and tumour cells can be sensitive to both the quality (that is, which pathways are activated) and the quantity (that is, magnitude of pathway activation) of signal pathway activation 12?14,17?19. Furthermore, we show that discontinuous dosing forestalls the onset of drug resistance in two primary human xenograft models. Our observations, and those of others, suggest that the majority of BRAF(V600E) melanomas remain reliant on the reactivation of ERK despite ongoing inhibition of BRAF(V600E). In these cases, drug resistance is achieved via elevated signalling through receptor tyrosine kinases, mutational activation of NRAS or MEK, amplification of BRAF, or alternative splicing of the BRAF T1799A precursor mRNA to yield aberrant forms of BRAF(V600E) 6?9,15,16. Our data indicate that some mechanisms of vemurafenib resistance confer a fitness deficit upon the tumour cells in the absence of the drug. This is probably due to elevated ERK1/2 activation that leads to arrest of the cell division cycle or the onset of apoptosis. Indeed, established literature indicates that deliberate elevation of RAF\u00a1\u00e6MEK\u00a1\u00e6ERK signalling in bona fide human cancer cells can have antiproliferative effects 11?13. Furthermore, these data suggest that the durability of responses to agents like vemurafenib may be improved through alterations in the dosing schedule, a phenomenon consistent with a recent case report of two melanoma patients with BRAF mutations who demonstrated a secondary antitumour response to BRAF inhibition after cessation of BRAF-inhibitor treatment owing to acquired drug resistance 20. Moreover, these results may have implications for other targeted cancer therapies, especially those that target RAF\u00a1\u00e6MEK\u00a1\u00e6ERK signalling. Although published clinical observations are still lacking, we suggest that dose regimens that exceed the daily maximum tolerated dose could be used to induce rapid tumour regression, followed by a drug holiday to prevent the onset of toxicities observed with chronic daily dosing and the emergence of drug-resistant tumour cells. Whereas continuous dosing promotes the clonal expansion of drug-resistant cells 12?14,21,22, intermittent dosing could serve to eliminate the fitness advantage of the resistant cells and delay the onset of drug-resistant disease. Hence, our results could have an impact on the use of pathway-targeted therapies to treat at least the subset of melanomas in which BRAF is mutated. METHODS. Copy number assay. DNA from tumour tissue was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (69504, Quiagen) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol. Quantitative PCRwas carried outusing the Taqman genotypingmaster mix, Taqman assay (Hs04949885_cn, Hs05005955_cn or Hs04949201_cn; Applied Biosystems), and RnaseP was used as a normalization control for DNA content. Quantitative analysis was carried out using the 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). RT?qPCR. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Kit (74104, Quiagen) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol. One-step RT?qPCR reactions were carried out in triplicate using the Quantitect Multiple RT?PCR master mix, Taqman Gene expression assay primer and 18S probe, Taqman Gene expression assay primer and BRAF probe (4331182, Applied Biosystems), and Quantitect RT mix. Quantitative measurements were collected using the 7500 Realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Endogenous control 18S was used as a normalization control for RNA content. pERK1/2 and pMEK measurements. Meso Scale Discovery plates were used for pERK1/2 (K111DWD-2), total ERK (K111DXD-2), pMEK (K111DUD-2) or total MEK (K111CWD-2) analysis according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol. Plates were analysed on the SECTOR Imager. Both pERK1/2 and pMEK readings were normalized to the total ERK and total MEK levels, respectively. Data for Supplementary Figs 1d, e, 2 and 4a, c were collected using this method. Cell viability assay. HMEX1906 cells were split 1:2 the day before seeding. Cells were plated in 100 \u00a5\u00ecl of media the next day at 2,000 cells per well onto black-walled, clear-bottom 96-well plates (3904, Corning Costar). Cells were incubated for 3 days with or without compound at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C before carrying out the viability assay. Using the Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability assay kit (Promega) and instructions, luminescent measurements were taken on Trilux MicroBeta2. The graphically represented values are means \u00a1\u00be s.d. for three independent samples. Cell culture. HMEX1906 cell lines were generated using FNAs from either the parental or the resistant tumours. The FNA was then directly flushed out into EGM media (CC-3124, Lonza) and transferred onto collagen-coated plates (BD Biosciences). Media was changed every day until all tumour debris was gone. Once cell lines were established the plates were maintained at about 50?80% confluence and with media change twice a week. Resistant tumour cell lines were maintained in 50 nM vemurafenib. BRAF siRNA and western blots. HMEX1906 cells were plated 1 day before transfection at 70% confluency. The next day parallel plates were left untreated, or were transfected with a non-targeting pool of siRNA or BRAF14 on target plus siRNA (target sequence, AGACGGGACUCGAGUGAUG, J-003460-14; Dharmacon). For the transfections, 1,000 \u00a5\u00ecl of Opti-MEM was mixed with 17.5 \u00a5\u00ecl of siRNA to give a final concentration of 50 nM; this was then combined with 1,000 \u00a5\u00ecl Opti-MEM and 21 \u00a5\u00ecl of Dharmafect 1. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature (25 \u00a1\u00c6C) on a shaker, the transfection mix was applied drop-wise to the cells and incubated overnight. Protein lysates, pERK1/2 assays and cell viability assays were then carried out 72 h after transfection. BRAF immunoblot was carried out with RAF-B (F-7) antibody (sc-5284; Santa Cruz). Accumen pERK1/2 assay. HMEX1906 cells were plated at 2,000 cells per well onto black-walled, clear-bottom Corning Costar 96-well plates (#3904) and incubated for 72 h in varying drug concentrations. On day 3, the media was discarded and the cells were fixed using 100 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15?20 min. The wells were washed with PBS and then permeabilized with PBS plus 0.1%Triton for 10?15 min at room temperature. The plates were then blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h, after which pERK1/2 (4370; Santa Cruz) primary antibody was applied to the cells at a 1:200 dilution in PBS with 0.1% Triton and 1% BSA. Plates were left overnight on a shaker at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C. Plates were washed and secondary antibody (Invitrogen Alexa 488) and Hoechst stain (34580; Invitrogen) were applied at 1:1,000 and 1:2,500, respectively, for 1?1.5 h. The plates were washed and sealed to scan on the Acumen EX3. PERK1/2 levels were normalized to cell numbers for data analysis. Clonogenic assay. SK-Mel-239-C3 vemurafenib-resistant cells were plated at the indicated cell density in 2 \u00a5\u00ecM vemurafenib. The next day, half the plates were washed and re-fed with media lacking vemurafenib (day 0). Plates were stained with crystal violet on the days indicated. Plates were re-fed with the appropriate media plus or minus vemurafenib every 3 days. Supplementary Material. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Targeting ER stress?induced autophagy overcomes BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma\tMelanomas that result from mutations in the gene encoding BRAF often become resistant to BRAF inhibition (BRAFi), with multiple mechanisms contributing to resistance. While therapy-induced autophagy promotes resistance to a number of therapies, especially those that target PI3K/mTOR signaling, its role as an adaptive resistance mechanism to BRAFi is not well characterized. Using tumor biopsies from BRAF V600E melanoma patients treated either with BRAFi or with combined BRAF and MEK inhibition, we found that BRAFi-resistant tumors had increased levels of autophagy compared with baseline. Patients with higher levels of therapy-induced autophagy had drastically lower response rates to BRAFi and a shorter duration of progression-free survival. In BRAF V600E melanoma cell lines, BRAFi or BRAF/MEK inhibition induced cytoprotective autophagy, and autophagy inhibition enhanced BRAFi-induced cell death. Shortly after BRAF inhibitor treatment in melanoma cell lines, mutant BRAF bound the ER stress gatekeeper GRP78, which rapidly expanded the ER. Disassociation of GRP78 from the PKR-like ER-kinase (PERK) promoted a PERK-dependent ER stress response that subsequently activated cytoprotective autophagy. Combined BRAF and autophagy inhibition promoted tumor regression in BRAFi-resistant xenografts. These data identify a molecular pathway for drug resistance connecting BRAFi, the ER stress response, and autophagy and provide a rationale for combination approaches targeting this resistance pathway. Introduction. The 50% response rate and 7-month progression-free survival (PFS) observed in clinical trials of BRAF inhibition (BRAFi) using the inhibitors vemurafenib (also known as PLX4032) and dabrafenib represents a major advance in the treatment of melanoma patients harboring the BRAF V600E mutation. However, nearly 100% of patients eventually progress on BRAFi therapy (1?3). Recently, a number of resistance mechanisms to BRAF inhibitors were proposed, involving either reactivation of the MAPK kinase pathway or concurrent activation of alternative growth factor signaling pathways (4). These studies demonstrate that BRAFi resistance is likely to be heterogeneous, encompassing a spectrum of molecular changes that are being found in biopsies obtained during treatment and at the time of progression. Drug-induced autophagy has emerged as a common pathway of resistance to a number of kinase inhibitors. In most of these cases, the focus of the effects of kinase inhibitors on autophagy has been on the well-characterized link between PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and autophagy (5). Much less is known about the link between MAPK signaling and autophagy. Autophagy is a multistep process that involves the sequestration of organelles and proteins in autophagic vesicles (AVs) and subsequent lysosome-dependent degradation of these contents, leading to recycling of macromolecules to fuel further growth. There is a large body of evidence to indicate that autophagy can promote cell survival within the tumor microenvironment (5, 6), depending on cellular and tissue context. Within the same cell, cytoprotective autophagy is often upregulated early during cancer therapy and concurrently with cell death pathways such as apoptosis. Especially in vivo, therapy-induced autophagy that is observed within intact tumor cells in a shrinking tumor may be indicative of cells that are not destined to die, but are adapting to therapeutic stress and will eventually give rise to recurrent tumors. Based on reports that autophagy inhibition can augment the antitumor efficacy of therapies that induce autophagy (7?10), numerous clinical trials involving the first-generation autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been launched (5, 11). We previously reported that high levels of autophagy prior to treatment predict invasiveness, poor response to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and shortened survival in metastatic melanoma (12). Elevated levels of autophagy in primary tumors also correlated with proliferation and lymph node metastases in human melanoma tumors (13, 14). These results demonstrate that autophagy levels can be high before treatment in melanoma, but may be induced even further during therapies, and support the notion that autophagy modulation may be especially effective as a therapeutic strategy in melanoma. To date, the role of autophagy as a potential druggable adaptive resistance mechanism in the setting of BRAFi has not been investigated. Here we report elevated levels of autophagy after treatment with vemurafenib, dabrafenib, or the combination of dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib in melanoma patient tumor samples that persist at the time of progression. The mechanistic link between BRAF signaling and autophagy, and the effects of autophagy inhibition in BRAFi-sensitive and BRAFi-resistant cell lines, were studied. Our findings indicate that BRAFi induces cytoprotective autophagy through activation of an ER stress response, and that targeting multiple components of the ER stress?autophagy pathway can overcome BRAFi resistance in melanoma. Results. Vemurafenib-induced autophagy in patient tumor samples.. To determine whether autophagy levels increase in response to BRAFi, paired biopsy samples from 15 patients with BRAF mutant melanoma treated with BRAF inhibitors were stained for the autophagy marker LC3B. LC3 is an ubiquitin-like cytoplasmic protein that is conjugated to the surface of AVs as they are formed. Autophagy levels are directly reflected by the degree of punctuate LC3B (14). The clinical characteristics of the 15 advanced BRAF mutant melanoma patients included in our analysis are presented in Supplemental Table 1 (supplemental material available online with this article; doi: 10.1172/JCI70454DS1). Patients were all treated at therapeutic doses with the single-agent BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib (n = 10) or dabrafenib (n = 2) or with the combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib (n = 3). For each of the 15 patients, we applied our previously validated LC3B immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay (14) to tissue biopsies from tumors prior to treatment (pretreatment samples) and to tumors that were regrowing despite treatment with BRAF inhibitors (resistance samples) (Figure ?(Figure1A).1A). The LC3B IHC scores for pretreatment versus resistance samples were 13% versus 7% for 1+, 67% versus 7% (P < 0.05) for 2+, 20% versus 40% (P < 0.05) for 3+, and 0% versus 46% (P < 0.05) for 4+. LC3B scores in pretreatment samples were lower than those in resistance samples in 74% of cases, equal in 13% of cases, and higher in 13% of cases (Figure ?(Figure1B).1B). Higher-powered views of LC3B staining in pretreatment and progression samples showed not only increased total LC3B signaling, but an increase in the punctuate staining pattern that is typically associated with AV buildup (Supplemental Figure 1A). Serial tumor biopsies from 2 patients with BRAF mutant melanoma enrolled on clinical trials of vemurafenib were obtained and analyzed by electron microscopy. Even within 15 days of starting treatment, cells surviving the stress of BRAFi, with intact nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes, had a 2- to 6-fold increase in AVs compared with baseline measurements (Supplemental Figure 1B). Biopsy of tumor tissue at the time of progression demonstrated persistently elevated levels of autophagy in both patients. These findings demonstrated that at therapeutic doses of BRAF inhibitors, autophagy is induced early in patient tumors, and elevated autophagy persists at the time of tumor progression. The clinical relevance of the observed increase in autophagy at the time of resistance as a potential adaptive resistance mechanism in melanoma cells was apparent when we correlated changes in LC3B levels and absolute LC3B levels in progression samples with clinical outcomes. Patients who had a 2+ increase in LC3B staining in progression versus baseline samples had a 17% confirmed partial response rate (>30% shrinkage of tumor compared with baseline on 2 computed tomography scans separated by at least 30 days), whereas patients who did not have a 2+ increase in LC3B staining in progression versus baseline biopsies had an 88% confirmed partial response rate (P < 0.05, Fisher exact test; Figure ?Figure1C).1C). Similarly, patients with 4+ LC3B staining at progression had significantly shorter PFS (median 229 days) than patients with lower levels of LC3B staining in progression samples (median 275 days; hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.08?0.99; P = 0.0487, log-rank test; Figure ?Figure1D).1D). These clinical data demonstrated that autophagy is a potentially druggable adaptive resistance mechanism to BRAFi. BRAFi induces autophagy in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines.. To determine the role of autophagy in BRAFi resistance, we assessed autophagy induction in 6 BRAF V600E melanoma cell lines, including a set of paired cell lines that were BRAFi-sensitive, but had acquired BRAFi resistance through chronic in vitro exposure (15). We categorized cell lines as either BRAFi-sensitive (A375P, SKMEL5, MEL1617) or BRAFi-resistant (MEL1617R, WM983BR, MEL624) by treating cells with the highly specific BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 and identifying the IC 50. Based on previous literature for BRAFi resistance mechanisms (15, 16), we classified cell lines with nanomolar IC 50s as BRAFi-sensitive and those with micromolar or millimolar IC 50s as BRAFi-resistant (Figure ?(Figure2A).2A). After 48 hours of treatment with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720, immunoblotting against the autophagy markers LC3 and p62 was conducted. When conjugated to the AV surface, the conjugated form of LC3 (LC3II) migrates separately from the unconjugated, free cytoplasmic form (LC3I). The LC3II/LC3I ratio is reflective of AV accumulation (17). When autophagy is induced, the LC3II/LC3I ratio is increased, and levels of the protein cargo adaptor p62 drop as it gets digested within functional AVs (18). After treatment with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720, we observed a significant increase in the LC3II/LC3I ratio and a significant decline in p62 in all cell lines (Figure ?(Figure22B). To ensure that BRAFi was in fact inducing autophagy and not blocking distal clearance of AVs, A375P mCherry-eGFP-LC3 cells were treated with DMSO, 1 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720, 500 nM rapamycin, or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM HCQ (Figure ?(Figure2C).2C). In the absence of any treatment, diffuse LC3 fluorescence was observed. Treatment with PLX4720 produced small red puncta, similar to the canonical autophagy inducer rapamycin, indicative of increased production of autophagosomes and increased autophagic flux, since functional fusion with the lysosome allows quenching of the GFP signal. In contrast, treatment with HCQ produced yellow puncta, reflecting lysosomal impairment and distal autophagy blockade producing persistence of green and red fluorescence (18). To ensure that autophagy was induced by BRAFi and not an off-target effect of PLX4720, we used control nontarget shRNA (shNT) and shRNA against BRAF (shBRAF) in BRAFi-sensitive A375P cells, generating the stable clones A375PshNT and A375PshBRAF cells, respectively. Autophagy induction, as evidenced by elevated LC3II/LC3I ratio, was observed in all subclones of A375PshBRAF compared with A375PshNT cells (Figure ?(Figure2D).2D). Treatment of A375PshNT and A375PshBRAF cells with HCQ for 48 hours demonstrated that autophagy inhibition produced a more than 3-fold increase in growth inhibition in A375PshBRAF versus A375PshNT cells (Figure ?(Figure2E),2E), which indicated that autophagy associated with genetic BRAF suppression was cytoprotective. Finally, we determined the effect on autophagy and cell death of MAPK pathway inhibition with a second BRAF inhibitor, GSK2118436, the MEK inhibitor GSK1120212, and combined BRAFi and MEK inhibition. This BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination is currently showing promising activity and acceptable safety in human clinical trials (19). Treatment with GSK2118436 or GSK1120212 alone clearly induced autophagy, with increased LC3II/LC3I ratio and decreased p62, at the 48-hour time point (Figure ?(Figure2F).2F). BRAF/MEK inhibition produced an additive increase in LC3II/LC3I ratio, but the combination of GSK2118436 or GSK1120212 with HCQ produced substantial increases in LC3II/LC3I ratio and p62 levels, and the triple drug combination (GSK2118436, GSK1120212, and HCQ) produced the most substantial increase in LC3II/LC3I ratio and buildup of p62 (Figure ?(Figure2F),2F), indicative of simultaneous autophagy induction and distal autophagy blockade. Similar results were observed in BRAFi-resistant MEL624 cells (Supplemental Figure 2A). Autophagy inhibition augments BRAFi-associated growth impairment.. HCQ blocks autophagy by impairing lysosomal function and causing accumulation of AVs with undigested contents (8). Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy with HCQ was compared with genetic inhibition of autophagy using shRNA against ATG5 in BRAFi-resistant MEL624 and BRAFi-sensitive A375P cells (Figure ?(Figure3A).3A). Stable clones of MEL624shNT, MEL624shATG5, A375PshNT, and A375PshATG5 cells were selected (Supplemental Figure 2B). Despite the finding that HCQ produced an equivalent degree of autophagy inhibition in MEL624 versus A375P cells (Supplemental Figure 2C), addition of HCQ significantly augmented PLX4720-induced growth impairment (as measured by 72-hour MTT assay) nearly 2-fold in MEL624 cells, but not in BRAFi-sensitive A375P cells. Knockdown of ATG5 in MEL624 cells produced a 2-fold significant augmentation of growth inhibition, nearly identical to the effects of HCQ treatment (Figure ?(Figure3A).3A). Long-term autophagy suppression augmented PLX4720-associated suppression of colony formation in a 14-day clonogenic assay for both BRAFi-sensitive A375P and BRAFi-resistant MEL1617R and MEL624 cells (Figure ?(Figure3B).3B). Our previous work demonstrated that autophagy levels in cancer cells grown as 3D spheroids in a collagen matrix closely resemble autophagy measured in tumor cells within a tumor microenvironment (12). Treatment with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM HCQ significantly augmented BRAFi-induced cell death in BRAFi-sensitive A375P, WM983B, and MEL1617 cells as well as in BRAFi-resistant MEL624, MEL1617R, and WM983BR cells grown as 3D spheroids (Supplemental Figure 3). Recently, our group reported the synthesis and characterization of a novel lysosomal autophagy inhibitor, Lys05, which is 10-fold more potent as an autophagy inhibitor than HCQ (20). PLX4720 in combination with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM Lys05 resulted in additive cytotoxicity in A375P, SKMEL5, MEL1617, and MEL624 cells (Figure ?(Figure3C).3C). Autophagy inhibition with HCQ also augmented the cytotoxicity of the combined BRAF/MEK inhibitors GSK2118436 and GSK1120212, but only in BRAFi-resistant MEL624 cells, not in BRAFi-sensitive A375P cells (Figure ?(Figure3D).3D). Importantly, there was no antagonism observed when HCQ was combined with BRAF/MEK inhibitors in BRAFi-sensitive cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that BRAFi-induced autophagy is a cytoprotective stress response that is limiting, not promoting, BRAFi-induced cell death. While BRAFi activates autophagy in both BRAFi-sensitive and BRAFi-resistant cells, the latter may be more reliant on autophagy as a survival mechanism, and therefore are more reliably sensitive across models to autophagy inhibition. PLX4720-induced autophagy is associated with early ER stress.. Next, we investigated the mechanism by which PLX4720 induces autophagy. Autophagy can be activated by alterations in various growth factor signaling cascades (5). The major known direct signaling regulators of autophagy include mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), AMPK, and specific components of the ER stress response (5). Previous studies suggest that BRAFi can potentially activate AMPK by disinhibiting liver kinase B1 (LKB1) (21, 22). Activated AMPK can phosphorylate and activate the unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) complex, one of the first complexes involved in initiating autophagy (23). Activated mTORC1 phosphorylates and inhibits multiple components of the ULK1 complex. Inhibition of mTORC1 signaling leads to dephosphorylation of the inhibitory phosphorylation site Ser757 on ULK1 (24). Within 1 and 4 hours of BRAF inhibitor treatment, no significant change was observed in the levels of phospho-AMPK (Thr172; indicating activation) or phospho?p70 S6 kinase (phospho-p70S6K) (Thr308; indicating activation) upstream of mTORC1 in the BRAFi-resistant MEL624 cells (Figure ?(Figure4A).4A). By 24 hours, when there was clear evidence of PLX4720-induced autophagy (increased LC3II/LC3I ratio and decreased p62), there was a modest decline in phospho-AMPK levels, indicative of decreased AMPK activity. Phospho-ULK1 (Ser757) was increased (Figure ?(Figure4A),4A), reflecting decreased ULK1 activity. These results indicate that major changes in mTORC1, AMPK, or ULK1 signaling are not associated with BRAFi-induced autophagy. In contrast, multiple markers of the ER stress response were elevated at early time points in response to BRAFi. The ER stress response can be activated by a number of cellular stresses and is controlled primarily by the gatekeeper GRP78, which binds and limits activation of 3 transmembrane proteins: PKR-like ER-kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring kinase 1\u00a5\u00e1 (IRE1\u00a5\u00e1), and activating transcription factor 6\u00a5\u00e1 (ATF6\u00a5\u00e1) (reviewed in refs. 25, 26). The most well-studied connection between the ER stress response and autophagy involves the PERK arm of the ER stress response. PERK activation leads to phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u00a5\u00e1 (eIF2\u00a5\u00e1) and increased expression of the transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) (26). Immunoblotting against whole-cell lysates indicated striking upregulation of ATF4 within 4 hours in MEL624 and A375P cells treated with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720, but not the 1 \u00a5\u00ecM lower dose (Supplemental Figure 4A). Dose-dependent decreases in p62 levels, indicative of autophagy induction, were most evident at 6 hours, which indicates that autophagy closely followed induction of the ER stress response. However, within 6 hours of low-dose PLX4720 treatment (1 \u00a5\u00ecM), substantial increases in the levels of phospho-eIF2\u00a5\u00e1 were observed in BRAFi-sensitive A375P and BRAFi-resistant MEL624 cells (Figure ?(Figure4B).4B). Probing nuclear lysates of low-dose PLX4720?treated cells, instead of whole-cell lysates, demonstrated substantial increases in the levels of ATF4 and CHOP within 4?6 hours. This upregulation of ER stress markers persisted for 48 hours at levels similar to or higher than those of the canonical ER stress activator thapsigargin. Higher doses of PLX4720 (10 \u00a5\u00ecM) produced even higher levels of phospho-eIF2\u00a5\u00e1 and ATF4 at earlier time points (1?4 hours) (Supplemental Figure 4B). In support of the dose-dependent increase in PERK-related signaling associated with BRAFi, mRNA levels of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which is known to coordinate transcription downstream of eIF2\u00a5\u00e1 and in conjunction with ATF4 (27), also increased in response to PLX4720 (Supplemental Figure 4C). Other arms of the ER stress response were activated to a lesser degree in a dose- and time-dependent fashion after PLX4720 treatment, including spliced and translationally active X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA (Supplemental Figure 4C), which is predominantly downstream of IRE1\u00a5\u00e1 signaling. To determine the proximal link between BRAFi and ER stress activation, a proximity ligation assay (PLA) (28) was performed on MEL624 cells using antibodies against GRP78 and BRAF, while simultaneously outlining the ER via immunofluorescence against the ER resident protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (Figure ?(Figure4C).4C). Positive and negative PLA controls performed as expected (Supplemental Figure 5A). In the absence of BRAFi, a faint PLA signal indicated that mutant BRAF does bind to GRP78 to some degree in the absence of drug treatment. This binding occurs mainly in the cytoplasmic pool of mutant BRAF, as images of GRP78-BRAF and the ER marker did not markedly colocalize. While the GRP78 protein predominantly resides in the ER, there is a cytoplasmic variant, GRP78va, which lacks the ER localization signal but retains its cytoplasmic chaperone function (29). Within 30 minutes of treatment with PLX4720, the GRP78-BRAF PLA signal increased more than 2-fold. A substantial increase in binding between mutant BRAF within the ER pool and GRP78 was also observed. These findings suggested that while mutant BRAF bound to GRP78va constitutively, BRAFi promoted further binding of mutant BRAF and GRP78 within the ER, thereby allowing the ensuing ER stress response. To further confirm that GRP78 does in fact bind to BRAF in a drug-dependent manner, MEL624 cells were transduced with viral particles containing empty expression vector or a vector expressing Flag-tagged BRAF V600E. While total levels of GRP78 were similar in vehicle-treated vector control, vehicle-treated Flag-BRAF V600E, and PLX4720-treated Flag-BRAF V600E MEL624 cells, co-IP of mutant BRAF followed by immunoblotting for GRP78 revealed that significant levels of GRP78 bound to mutant BRAF in the presence, but not the absence, of the BRAF inhibitor (Supplemental Figure 5B). At the same time that PLX4720-induced binding of ER-resident mutant BRAF and GRP78 was observed, dissociation of ER-resident GRP78 and PERK was also observed (Figure ?(Figure4C).4C). Thus, the ER stress response appears to be activated in a canonical fashion in BRAF mutant melanoma cells treated with BRAF inhibitor. Drug-induced binding of GRP78 to mutant BRAF and simultaneous dissociation of this gatekeeper chaperone from the activators of the ER stress response (30) leads to activation of the ER stress response after BRAFi. In addition, a significant expansion of the ER area per cell was observed (Figure ?(Figure4C4C and Supplemental Figure 5C). Morphological changes in the ER, consistent with ER stress, were observable by electron microscopy at later time points (Supplemental Figure 6). PLX4720 treatment produced dilated and disorganized ER with granular contents suggestive of retained unfolded proteins, similar to the ER stress inducer thapsigargin, providing morphological evidence that BRAFi induces early ER stress. Blockade of PERK-dependent ER stress response limits BRAFi-induced autophagy and enhances cell death.. To determine whether this ER stress response contributes to BRAFi-induced cell death, or rather mitigates it (like autophagy), we studied the effects of PERK kinase activity blockade, with or without BRAFi, on cell death markers using the potent and specific PERK inhibitor GSK2606414 (31). MEL624 and A375P cells treated with PLX4720 demonstrated increased levels of phospho-PERK that were nearly completely abrogated when PLX4720 was combined with GSK2606414 (Figure ?(Figure5,5, A and B). Neither PLX4720 nor GSK2606414 treatment alone produced increased levels of the apoptosis markers cleaved PARP or cleaved caspase-3 compared with control cells; however, significant accumulation of both were observed with combined BRAF and PERK inhibition. This increased apoptosis with combined BRAFi and ER stress inhibition was further confirmed by measuring cell viability in MEL624 cells treated with DMSO, 1 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720, 1 \u00a5\u00ecM GSK2606414, or the combination. At both 24 and 48 hours, combined BRAFi and PERK inhibition produced additive cytotoxicity compared with either treatment alone (Figure ?(Figure5C).5C). While PERK inhibition alone had minimal effects on autophagy, as measured by LC3II/LC3I ratio, combining PERK inhibition with BRAFi completely abrogated BRAFi-induced autophagy (Figure ?(Figure5D).5D). To further confirm that the PERK arm of the ER stress response is essential for BRAFi-induced autophagy, MEL624 and A375P cells transfected with siRNA against PERK were treated with DMSO or PLX4720 (Figure ?(Figure5,5, E and F). Knockdown of PERK was robust (Supplemental Figure 7) with separate duplexes. PLX4720 treatment resulted in a significant increase in the LC3II/LC3I ratio in cells transfected with the siRNA against nontarget control, reflective of PLX4720-induced autophagy. In contrast, there was no PLX4720-associated increase in LC3II/LC3I ratio in cells transfected with siPERK in either cell line (Figure ?(Figure5,5, E and F). These results establish a significant role for PERK-dependent ER stress response in PLX4720-induced autophagy. Lysosomal autophagy inhibition augments the efficacy of BRAFi in vivo.. Since autophagy inhibition with HCQ is already being tested in clinical trials, we sought to determine the effects of combining BRAFi and lysosomal autophagy inhibition in vivo. MEL624 was chosen for in vivo studies because it is naturally occurring in the BRAF mutant PTEN wild-type cell line (32) that has de novo resistance to BRAFi, reflecting a large subset of BRAF mutant melanoma that may not be effectively addressed by BRAF and PI3K pathway inhibitor combinations that are entering clinical trials. Xenografts were generated in the flanks of nude mice using BRAFi-resistant MEL624 cells. Mice were treated daily with either PBS or 40 mg/kg Lys05 i.p. and fed either control or PLX4720-infused chow. After 15 days of daily treatment, the Lys05 dose was reduced to 20 mg/kg to avoid bowel toxicity (20). 1 mouse treated with Lys05 died, presumably of bowel toxicity. All other mice survived the planned 22 days of treatment without significant toxicity. At the end of 22 days, the combination of Lys05 and PLX4720-infused chow was the only treatment that produced significant tumor regression compared with control (Figure ?(Figure6A6A and Supplemental Figure 8). Cell lysates from tumors harvested at the end of this treatment were subjected to immunoblotting against phospho-MAPK, LC3, p62, and cleaved caspase-3 (Figure ?(Figure6B).6B). Quantification of Western blot bands by cohort indicated that all treatments produced reduced phospho-MAPK levels compared with control, even after 22 days of treatment. BRAFi alone significantly decreased p62, and BRAFi combined with Lys05 led to slightly increased p62 levels, as expected, due to simultaneous autophagy induction and distal blockade. PLX4720 treatment, both alone and in combination with Lys05, produced an increase in LC3II/LC3I ratio compared with controls. Cleaved caspase-3 was only evident in tumor lysates from mice treated with combined PLX4720 and Lys05, providing in vivo evidence that this combination enhances cell death compared with single-agent therapy. Electron microscopy demonstrated evident AV accumulation in tumors harvested from mice treated with single-agent Lys05- or PLX4720 compared with PBS treatment (Figure ?(Figure6C).6C). Massive AV accumulation was observed in tumors in mice treated with combined PLX4720 and Lys05. Discussion. Fluoro-deoxyglucose PET scan studies have demonstrated that BRAFi produces rapid, strikingly homogenous, and profound metabolic effects to all tumors in most BRAF mutant melanoma patients (33). This finding, and the significant survival benefit of single-agent vemurafenib, firmly established oncogenic BRAF as a driver mutation. BRAF mutant melanoma cells are therefore addicted to signaling through mutant BRAF. However, while some patients experience a prolonged tumor response that translates into a significant survival benefit (2), other patients with larger, bulkier tumors are likely to have short-lived tumor responses and progress rapidly (34). There have been a number of escape mechanisms described for BRAF mutant melanomas, including mutations and posttranslational alterations that activate either the MAPK pathway (16, 35) or the PI3K signaling pathway (15) in the face of continued BRAFi. A splicing variant of mutated BRAF was described as the first example of an alteration directly in the BRAF protein conformation that allows BRAF mutant melanoma cells to escape BRAFi-induced cell death (36). Some of these cell-intrinsic mechanisms of resistance are thought to be present in a small subset of cancer cells within tumors prior to starting treatment, rather than being directly induced by BRAFi. More recently, numerous adaptive mechanisms of resistance have been described, whereby BRAFi induces a resistance mechanism in a more substantial population of cells. For instance, FOXD3-dependent ERBB3 activation has been found to promote BRAFi resistance (37). Upregulation of antiapoptotic BCL2A1 (38) and reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism through MITF-dependent transcription (39) have also has been implicated as resistance mechanisms. The tumor microenvironment can also promote BRAFi resistance through stromal cell secretion of hepatocyte growth factor and engagement of MET signaling in BRAF mutant melanoma cells (40). The homogenous metabolic compromise to cancer cells, and the heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance and clinical outcome that result in patients, prompted us to study the effect of cytoprotective stress responses downstream of perturbed growth factor signaling, and lead us to the discovery of BRAFi-induced autophagy as an adaptive resistance mechanism to BRAFi. Unlike intrinsic resistance mechanisms (such as an oncogene mutation present in pretreatment tumor samples that confers immediate resistance to a subpopulation of tumors cells) or acquired resistance mechanisms (where reliance on alternative signaling pathways emerges over time, specifically in the resistant cell population), adaptive resistance mechanisms are not turned on to a substantial degree in cells before treatment, but rather are hardwired responses to drugs that occur early in the course of therapy, both in cells that are destined to die (sensitive) and in cells that are destined to survive therapy (resistant). Our data suggest that in certain model contexts, cells that have either intrinsic or acquired BRAFi resistance can also rely on BRAFi-induced autophagy more heavily for survival than BRAFi-sensitive cells. Importantly, blockade of autophagy did not antagonize BRAFi-induced cell death in BRAFi-sensitive cells, and in certain long-term cell culture models, this approach demonstrated additive cytotoxicity as well. Maximizing cell killing by initially targeting mutant BRAF and components of stress responses, such as autophagy, could prevent the emergence of cells that already have resistance to BRAFi due to bypasses in MAPK or alternative signaling pathways. Autophagy occurs at basal levels in virtually all cells, but is upregulated when cells face metabolic or therapeutic stress. During tumor response, in patients treated with vemurafenib, autophagy is increased in the surviving cells that are destined to recur. Our in vitro data, which demonstrated that autophagy was induced in both BRAFi-sensitive and BRAFi-resistant cell lines, indicate that cells that are dying or dead in response to BRAFi may have also induced autophagy as an attempt to survive the stress, but autophagy was inadequate to stop death due to BRAFi in sensitive cells. Consequently, combining autophagy blockade with BRAFi led to augmented cell death and growth impairment compared with BRAFi alone in both 2D and 3D culture. The results of the current study support therapeutic targeting of autophagy in melanoma and provide the preclinical rationale for launching clinical trials of the combination of BRAF and autophagy inhibitors. The identification of the ER stress response as the mechanistic link between BRAF signaling and cytoprotective autophagy establishes a new signaling axis that has multiple druggable targets. Our finding that mutant BRAF bound GRP78 in the presence of BRAFi identifies the proximal molecular link between MAPK signaling and the ER stress response in BRAF mutant melanoma cells. BRAFi-induced binding of mutant BRAF to the ER stress gatekeeper GRP78 within the ER is a new and unexpected molecular interaction. While BRAF lacks the predicted signal peptide, or the ER retention peptide KDEL, it may be that in the presence of BRAFi, a pool of mutant BRAF gets redirected or trapped in an unfolded state in the ER during translation. Further study is needed to confirm this subcellular localization, understand how mutant BRAF enters the ER, and determine the functional role (if any) for mutant BRAF within the ER. Previous work in yeast (41) and mammalian cells (42, 43) has established that ER stress can activate autophagy. We have previously found that the stress of forced Myc expression activates an ER stress response, followed by PERK-mediated processing of LC3 and increased autophagic flux (44). The PERK-eIF2\u00a5\u00e1-ATF4 axis is likely the critical connection between BRAF signaling and autophagy, since phosphorylation of eIF2\u00a5\u00e1 inhibited global translation accompanied with selective translation of ATF4, a transcription factor that regulates LC3 expression. ATF4 has been shown by at least 2 groups to stimulate autophagy (45, 46). The contribution of IRE1\u00a5\u00e1- and ATF6\u00a5\u00e1-dependent ER stress response signaling to activation of autophagy has been less well studied. In IRE1\u00a5\u00e1-dependent signaling, JNK is a known regulator of autophagy, both at the transcriptional level and through the phosphorylation of BCL2 and displacement of Beclin-BCL2 binding (47). The influence of the transcription factors XBP1 and CHOP and ATF6\u00a5\u00e1 on the activation of cytoprotective autophagy is unknown. A previous report found that the ER stress response that ensues after BRAFi in some BRAF mutant cell lines may contribute to BRAFi-associated apoptosis (48). In our present work, chemical and siRNA studies demonstrated that inhibition of components of the PERK arm of the ER stress response blunted PLX4720-induced autophagy and enhanced cell death. While it is clear that activation of an uncontrolled ER stress response or autophagy can contribute to cell death (26), our data support that in the setting of BRAFi, ER stress?induced autophagy can promote cell survival (Supplemental Figure 9). While there are currently no clinically available inhibitors that target components of the ER stress response or proximal autophagy inhibitors available to test in combination with BRAF inhibitors, the distal lysosomal autophagy inhibitor HCQ is being tested in multiple combination regimens for melanoma and other diseases. Based on the results of the present work, a clinical trial testing the safety of the combination of vemurafenib and HCQ in patients with BRAF mutant melanoma has already been launched (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01897116). Methods. Patient samples and IHC.. Patients\u00a1\u00af BRAF mutation status was confirmed by DNA sequencing (49). For LC3 IHC studies, FFPE slides were made from either freshly obtained biopsy tissue or, if unavailable, archival tissue. Slides were stained with anti-LC3B (Abcam Inc.; 1:500, with citric acid/antigen retrieval) by standard immunoperoxidase techniques all together by the Fontana-Masson procedure, which differentiates LC3B-positive tumor cells (brown) from tumor-associated melanophages (azure) (50). Original images were produced with a Zeiss Axioskop 40 light microscope equipped with a Spot Flex digital camera. All images were cut and assembled together into a single Photoshop document, merged into a single layer, and then treated with automatic contrast and brightening tools. LC3B staining intensity was assessed by 2 trained observers blinded to treatment, with independent agreement in 12 of 14 pairs (87%). Scoring was by consensus for the remaining 2 pairs. Scoring was as follows: 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong; 4, very strong. Cell culture and reagents.. Melanoma cell lines A375P, SKMEL5, 1205Lu, MEL624, MEL1617, MEL1617R, WM983B, WM983BR, and A375P mCherry-GFP-LC3 were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml gentamicin, and 25 mmol/l HEPES in the presence of 5% CO 2 at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. The BRAFi-resistant cell lines WM983BR and MEL1617R were generated and maintained as previously described (15). PLX4720 was provided by Plexxikon. Rapamycin and thapsigargin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. HCQ was purchased from Spectrum Chemicals. GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 were purchased from Selleck Chemicals. GSK2606414 was provided by Glaxo Smith Kline. PLX4720 and PLX4720-infused chow was provided by Plexxicon. Electron microscopy.. Electron microscopy was performed as previously described (12). Immunoblotting and IP.. Immunoblotting was performed on whole-cell lysates (12) and nuclear extracts as previously described (44). Cell Signaling Technology antibodies used were as follows: phospho-AMPK\u00a5\u00e1 (Thr172), AMPK\u00a5\u00e1 (23A3), phospho-ULK1 (Ser757), ULK1 (A705), cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175), phospho-eIF2\u00a5\u00e1 (Ser51), eIF2\u00a5\u00e1, PERK (C33E10), phospho?p70S6K (Thr389), and p70S6K. Santa Cruz antibodies used were as follows: CHOP (F-168), CHOP/GADD 153 antibody (B-3), p62/SQSTM1 (D-3), actin (I-19), ATF4/CREB-2 (C-20), and Raf-B (C-19). Novus Biologicals antibody used were as follows: ATG5 ([DyLight 488]). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against LC3 was generated from QCB biological using rat LC3B N terminus peptide as previously described (51). Phospho-PERK was a gift from A. Diehl (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA). Co-IP was performed using Pierce Crosslink Kit (Thermo Scientific; catalog no. 26417). Briefly, MEL624 cells were transduced with viral particles of Flag-tagged BRAF V600E or empty vector, then selected with 10 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml blasticidin for 72 hours. After blasticidin withdrawal for 24 hours, cells were treated with DMSO or 10 \u00a5\u00ecM PLX4720 for 30 minutes, then harvested for Co-IP. Anti-BRAF polyclonal antibody (10 \u00a5\u00ecg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-166) was coupled to 20 \u00a5\u00ecl Pierce Protein A/G Plus Agarose into a Pierce Spin Column, and Pierce Control Agarose Resin was used as a negative control. Co-IP reactions were performed at 4\u00a1\u00c6C overnight. Eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot for GRP78 (GRP78 antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-1051) and for Flag-BRAF V600E using both anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich, F3165) and anti-BRAF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-166). Densities from Western blots were quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS4 Extended. PLA.. PLA was performed using Duolink In Situ fluorescence technology (Olink Bioscience). Briefly, MEL624 cells were plated into 16-well Chamber Slides (Lab-Tek) and grown overnight. The cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 minutes and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes. Cells were blocked with 1% BSA for 40 minutes, then incubated with combinations of goat anti-GRP78 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-1051, sc-1050), rabbit anti-BRAF polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-166) and rabbit anti-PERK polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-13073)overnight at 4\u00a1\u00c6C. The primary antibodies were detected with secondary antibodies conjugated with the oligonucleotides of Anti-Goat PLUS (Sigma-Aldrich, DUO92003) and Anti-Rabbit MINUS (Sigma-Aldrich, DUO92005) at 1:5 dilution in 1% BSA buffer for 1 hour. The PLA reaction of goat anti-GRP78 and rabbit IgG isotype (Novus, NB600-441) with Anti-Goat PLUS/Anti-Rabbit MINUS was used as a technical negative control, and goat anti-GRP78 and rabbit anti-ATM (Santa Cruz, sc-7230) with Anti-Goat PLUS/Anti-Rabbit MINUS was used as a biological negative control. Detection of BRAF using rabbit anti-BRAF with Anti-Rabbit PLUS (Sigma-Aldrich, DUO92002) and Anti-Rabbit MINUS was used as a technical positive control. Ligation and amplification steps were performed using Duolink In Situ Detection Reagents Red (Sigma-Aldrich, DUO92008) according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions. To detect ER, the SelectivFX Fluor 488 ER Labeling Kit (Invitrogen, {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"S34253\",\"term_id\":\"421942\",\"term_text\":\"pir||S34253\"}}S34253) was used with a modified procedure and incorporated into the above PLA assay. Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axioplan Microscope at \u00a1\u00bf20, \u00a1\u00bf40, and \u00a1\u00bf100 magnification. Quantification of intensity and area of fluorescent signal was performed by applying the Adobe Photoshop magic wand tool to specific colors on unadjusted TIFF images collected directly from the microscope. MTT assay, clonogenic assay, and 3D culture.. For the MTT assay, cells were treated in 6 replicates for 72 hours. MTT reagent (Roche) was applied, cells were solubilized, and absorbance was read at 570 nm, with background subtraction at 690 nm. The clonogenic assay was performed as previously described (52). Briefly, cells were suspended in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS, then plated in 6-well plates (1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 3 cells/well). Medium was changed and drug treated every 3?4 days. After incubation for 2 weeks, colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted. 3D spheroid experiments were conducted as previously described (12) using the Live/Dead Assay (Molecular Probes). Spheroid dimensions and quantification of percentage of dead cells was done using the lasso and magic wand tools in Adobe Photoshop Extended CS4. RNA interference.. Knockdown of human PERK expression was performed using Thermo Scientific Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus siRNA (catalog nos. NT D-001810-10-05, J-004883-09, and J-004883-10) and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Briefly, MEL624 and A375P cells were plated at a density of 30% confluence at the time of transfection. After 48 hours, cells were treated with DMSO or PLX4720 and cultured for 24 hours, and protein expression levels were then measured by Western blotting. Knockdown of ATG5 expression was performed using the following Sigma-Aldrich mission shRNA vectors: TRCN0000150940, 0000151963, 0000150645, 0000150976, and 0000151474. TRC Non-Target shRNA vectorSHC002 was used as negative control. Cells were transfected with the above vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and selected with puromycin. Knockdown of BRAF was accomplished using OpenBiosystems shRNA pLKO.1 plasmids. Specifically, MEL624 and A375P cells were transduced with the lentiviral particles, which were produced by cotransfection of shBRAF (hp3, TRCN0000006293, sequence TTGCTGGTGTATTCTTCATAG; hp4, TRCN0000006292, sequence TTTGAAGGCTTGTAACTGCTG) and shNT (sequence CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCGCTCGAGCGAGGGCGACTTAACCTTAGG) with lentiviral packaging plasmid mix into the packaging cell line HEK293. The transduced MEL624 and A375P cells were selected by puromycin until cells were to be assayed, and then protein expression levels were measured by Western blotting. Tumor xenograft experiments.. All experiments were carried out using 5-week-old nu/nu nude mice (Charles River Labs). Tumor generation, tumor measurements, and tissue harvesting were performed as previously described (20). Statistics.. To assess statistical significance in experiments directly comparing an experimental group with a control group, Student\u00a1\u00afs unpaired, 2-tailed t test was used. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significantly different from the null hypothesis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted using Graphpad Prism, and the log-rank test was used to assess statistical significance of differences between survival curves. Study approval.. For patient materials, informed consent on a University of Pennsylvania IRB-approved tissue collection protocol was obtained for each patient prior to biopsy or retrieval of archival tumor tissue and correlation with clinical outcome. Approval for animal care and use for these experiments was provided by the University of Pennsylvania IACUC. Supplementary Material. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "A secreted PTEN phosphatase that enters cells to alter signaling and survival\tPhosphatase and Tensin Homologue on chromosome Ten (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor and an antagonist of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway. We identified a 576-amino acid translational variant of PTEN, termed PTEN-Long, that arises from an alternative translation start site 519 bp upstream of the ATG initiation sequence, adding 173 N-terminal amino acids to the normal PTEN open reading frame. PTEN-Long is a membrane permeable lipid phosphatase that is secreted from cells and can enter other cells. As an exogenous agent, PTEN-Long antagonized PI3K signaling and induced tumor cell death in vitro and in vivo. By providing a means to restore a functional tumor suppressor protein to tumor cells, PTEN-Long may have therapeutic uses. PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome ten) is a tumor suppressor that is mutated in multiple types of cancer (1,2). PTEN encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase, whose primary substrate is phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3) (3?7). Through this activity, PTEN antagonizes phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling and thereby affects a myriad of cellular processes including growth, proliferation, and survival (8?11). In mice, loss of Pten in tumors or the tumor microenvironment results in neoplastic growth (12?14) indicating that PTEN\u00a1\u00afs tumor suppressive functions are not confined to tumor cells alone. Inspection of the PTEN mRNA transcript (Fig. 1A) revealed an alternative translation initiation codon (CUG) at bp 513 that was 5\u00a1\u00af of and in-frame with the canonical translation initiation codon (AUG) at bp 1032. Alternative translation beginning at bp 513 was predicted to encode a 576-amino acid translational variant, which we termed PTEN-Long. PTEN-Long contains a 173-amino acid domain at its N-terminus followed by the classical 403 amino acids of PTEN (Fig. S1)(15). Search of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/) database found five somatic missense mutations specific for PTEN-Long in tumor samples (Fig. S1). Alignment of the predicted 173 amino acid sequence of the PTEN-Long unique region with predicted protein sequences from other species indicated that it is evolutionarily conserved (Fig. S2). To determine if PTEN-Long is translated in cells we transfected human breast (BT549) and glioblastoma (U87MG) cells that lack PTEN with a cDNA expression vector containing the PTEN-Long and PTEN open reading frames. Immunoblots of these lysates revealed two forms of PTEN: a ~75-kD form, PTEN-Long, and a ~55-kD species that corresponded to the conventional translated protein. Expression of PTEN-Long was increased by mutating the alternate start site (CTG) to a classical start site (ATG) (16), was not diminished when the canonical ATG was mutated to ATA, and was lost if the alternatively translated region was deleted or a frame shift was introduced between the alternate start site at 513 and the classic start site at 1032 (Fig. S3). PTEN-Long showed a different enzymatic profile across the tested range of lipid substrate concentrations (soluble di-C8-phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (di-C8-PIP3)) (Fig. 1B, Fig. S4) (p<0.001 by ANOVA ) (17). A missense mutation in the phosphatase domain of PTEN-Long (G302R), analogous to PTEN (G129R), a tumor mutation, decreased the phosphatase activity of the protein (Fig. S5)(1, 18, 19). Immunoblots of U87MG cells overexpressing equivalent amounts of transfected PTEN, PTEN-Long, or their mutated analogues confirmed that, similar to PTEN, PTEN-Long decreased signaling through the PI3K pathway in a phosphatase-dependent manner (Fig. S6). Immunoblots of mouse embryonic stem cells and human cancer cell lines with antibodies either specific for PTEN-Long or an epitope shared by PTEN and PTEN-Long showed that a ~75 kD PTEN-Long band was present in wild-type but not cells lacking PTEN (Fig. 1C). Immunoprecipitations with PTEN or PTEN-Long antibodies confirmed that PTEN-Long contains canonical PTEN peptides and is therefore a translational variant of PTEN (Fig. 1D, Fig. S7). Amounts of PTEN-Long were reduced in primary human breast tumors compared to those of matched normal breast samples (Fig. 1E, Fig. S8, Table S1). Immunohistochemistry of brain tissue from a mouse glioblastoma caused by the deletion of Pten, p53, and overexpression of PDGF revealed that PTEN-Long was more abundant in the tumor microenvironment than in the tumor or normal tissue (Fig. S9)(20). PTEN-Long was similarily abundant in the tumor microenvironment in 4 of 50 samples from primary breast cancers (Fig. S10). Computer modeling indicated that PTEN-Long contained a secretion signal sequence with a predicted cleavage site at amino acid 22 (Fig. S11)(21). Thus, we tested whether PTEN-Long might exist outside of cells. We overexpressed V5 epitope tagged PTEN, PTEN-Long, and a mutant with an altered signal sequence predicted to abolish secretion (PTEN-Long\u00a5\u00c4A 6) (Fig. S12) in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. We concentrated the proteins from conditioned medium by immunoprecipitation with PTEN (138G6) antibody or with heparin columns (Fig. S13). With antibodies that recognized the V5 tag or the endogenous C terminal region of PTEN and PTEN-Long, we detected PTEN-Long but not PTEN nor PTEN-Long\u00a5\u00c4A 6 in conditioned medium (Fig. 2A, Fig. S14). Brefeldin-A, an inhibitor that interferes with retrograde transport of vesicles in the endoplasmic reticulum, inhibited the secretion of PTEN-Long (Fig.2B)(22). Endogenous PTEN-Long from HEK293 cells bound to concanavalin A-sepharose, a hallmark of a secreted glycoprotein (Fig. S15). Furthermore, PTEN-Long but not PTEN was present in both human plasma and serum (Fig. S16). A screen for PTEN interacting proteins identified multiple heparan-sulfate-modified cell surface proteins in the glypican and syndecan families (Fig. S17)(23). Thus PTEN-Long appears to be secreted from cells and to interact with cell surface proteins. We noted the presence of a poly-arginine stretch in the unique region of PTEN-Long that was evolutionarily conserved (Fig. S2) and bore a resemblance to the poly-basic residues of the cell-penetrating element of the HIV transactivator of transcription (TAT) protein (24, 25). To determine whether this sequence conferred similar properties to PTEN-Long, we constructed a PTEN-Long\u00a5\u00c4R 6 construct in which these six arginines were deleted (Fig. S18). After treating cells with 100 nM purified Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP)-V5/His, PTEN-Long-RFP-V5/His, or PTEN-Long\u00a5\u00c4R 6-RFP-V5/His, we detected PTEN-Long-RFP but not RFP nor PTEN-Long\u00a5\u00c4R 6-RFP in the cells by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3A, Fig. S19). We confirmed this observation through subcellular fractionation (Fig. 3B, Fig. S20). Fusion of the PTEN-Long unique region (PL) to red fluorescent protein (RFP) enabled cellular uptake of the fusion protein (Fig. S21). Therefore the PL domain facilitates cell penetration of tethered peptide sequences. We next tested whether PTEN-Long affected cellular signaling as an exogenous agent. Treatment of cells in culture for fifteen minutes with purified PTEN-Long reduced basal phosphorylation of the protein kinase AKT on Thr 308 in the majority of cell lines (Fig. 3C, Fig. S22?23). When starved U87MG cells were incubated with PTEN-Long for 10 minutes, subsequent stimulation of phosphorylation of AKT Thr 308 by insulin or epidermal growth factor (EGF) was inhibited. Inhibition of PI3K signaling appeared to be dependent upon the poly-arginine sequence of PTEN-Long because the PTEN-Long\u00a5\u00c4R 6 mutant did not block Insulin or EGF-induced phosphorylation of AKT (Fig. S24). Dose response experiments in cells deprived of serum and treated for 24 hours showed that PTEN-Long decreased PI3K signaling as indicated by the decreased phosphorylation of AKT, FOXO, and PRAS40, and induced cell death as indicated by cleavage of caspase 3 (Fig. 3,D?E). We confirmed this effect on cell survival by treating U87MG and MDA-MB-468 cells grown in 0.1% serum with various doses of PTEN-Long or PTEN-Long\u00a5\u00c4R 6 (Fig. 3F). Upon treatment of mice with PTEN-Long we observed in blood a transient increase in glucose concentration (Fig. S25) and PTEN-Long (Fig. S26). Similar to what we observed in culture, PTEN-Long was detected in mouse tissues, including a xenografted breast tumor (MDA-MB-468), and could alter cell signaling (Fig. S27?29). PTEN-Long derivatives lacking phosphatase or cell penetrating activity were unable to cause these signaling changes. TAT-PTEN only recapitulated some of the effects of PTEN-Long indicating that the PTEN-Long unique region may have other functions beyond the cell permeability conferred by TAT (Fig. S30). We further explored the effect of PTEN-Long in murine tumor models. We engrafted U87MG cells subcutaneously into athymic nude mice and allowed them to grow until their tumor volume reached approximately 0.2 cm 3. Animals were then injected intraperitoneally with PTEN-Long (4 mg/kg) or a control preparation. PTEN-Long caused tumor regression after four days of treatment (Fig. 4A, Fig. S31). Similar regressions were also observed in multiple other xenograft models with the exception of the human colon cancer tumor cell line HCT116 (Fig. S32?33). Although both PTEN-Long and PTEN-Long G302R were detected within tumor tissues after five days of treatment, only the wild-type protein affected PI3K signaling or induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B). Immunohistochemistry of serial sections of tumor xenografts confirmed exogenous PTEN-Long within tumor cells and a concomitant reduction of pAKT staining. We also treated syngeneic allografts from a mouse model of glioblastoma (GBM). After treatment with PTEN-Long (4 mg/kg), tumors derived from Pten ?/?, p53 ?/?, PDGF overexpressing GBM cells underwent complete tumor regression within five days, whereas treatment with PTEN-Long\u00a5\u00c4R 6 did not prevent tumor growth (Fig. 4C) (20). Mutant PTEN-Long proteins derived from three cancers (Fig. S1) in which PTEN-Long underwent somatic mutation all showed reduced ability to affect signaling in vitro and in vivo, suggesting there may be selective pressure to mutate PTEN-Long during tumor development (Fig. S34). Thus PTEN-Long protein appears to alter PI3K signaling in vivo to inhibit tumor growth and this effect is dependent on its entrance into cells. PTEN-Long is a translational variant of PTEN that, like classical PTEN, acts as an antagonist of the PI3K pathway. As a secreted product of a tumor suppressor gene capable of entering cells, endogenous PTEN-Long may contribute to an organism\u00a1\u00afs maintenance of signaling, tissue homeostasis and suppression of cancer. Recombinant PTEN-Long and derivative fusion proteins may be useful for delivering proteins in a variety of experimental and clinical settings. Supplementary Material. Supplementary Material.

                "text": "Development of a Colon Cancer GEMM-Derived Orthotopic Transplant Model for Drug Discovery and Validation\tPurpose. Effective therapies for KRAS mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) are a critical unmet clinical need. Previously, we described GEMMs for sporadic Kras mutant and non-mutant CRC suitable for preclinical evaluation of experimental therapeutics. To accelerate drug discovery and validation, we sought to derive low-passage cell lines from GEMM Kras mutant and wild-type tumors for in vitro screening and transplantation into the native colonic environment of immunocompetent mice for in vivo validation. Experimental Design. Cell lines were derived from Kras mutant and non-mutant GEMM tumors under defined media conditions. Growth kinetics, phosphoproteomes, transcriptomes, drug sensitivity, and metabolism were examined. Cell lines were implanted in mice and monitored for in vivo tumor analysis. Results. Kras mutant cell lines displayed increased proliferation, MAPK signaling, and PI3K signaling. Microarray analysis identified significant overlap with human CRC-related gene signatures, including KRAS mutant and metastatic CRC. Further analyses revealed enrichment for numerous disease-relevant biological pathways, including glucose metabolism. Functional assessment in vitro and in vivo validated this finding and highlighted the dependence of Kras mutant CRC on oncogenic signaling and on aerobic glycolysis. Conclusions. We have successfully characterized a novel GEMM-derived orthotopic transplant model of human KRAS mutant CRC. This approach combines in vitro screening capability using low-passage cell lines that recapitulate human CRC and potential for rapid in vivo validation using cell line-derived tumors that develop in the colonic microenvironment of immunocompetent animals. Taken together, this platform is a clear advancement in preclinical CRC models for comprehensive drug discovery and validation efforts. INTRODUCTION. Activating KRAS mutations are observed in 40?50% of human colorectal cancer (CRC) and pose a significant therapeutic challenge because of their inherent resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, such as cetuximab (Erbitux) or panitumumab (Vectibix) (1). Whereas this underscores the urgent need for development of novel therapeutic strategies, the overall success rate for the clinical approval of oncology drugs continues to be less than 10% (2). As the largest failure rates occur when efficacy in human patients is first directly assessed (phase II trials), robust pre-clinical models that faithfully model human disease are critical to maximize the efficiency of the clinical drug development pipeline. The majority of CRC genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) employ germ-line or tissue-wide modification of genes that are critical for CRC carcinogenesis (3). Although these are useful models for hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, such as Familial Adenomatous Polyposis and Lynch Syndrome, they are poor surrogates for sporadic CRC, which comprises ~80% of all CRC cases (4). Furthermore, the majority of these murine tumors present in the small intestine rather than the colon. To circumvent this problem, we have recently described novel GEMMs for sporadic CRC based on the delivery of adenovirus expressing cre recombinase (AdCre) in a restricted fashion to the distal colon of floxed mice (5). This is a faithful surrogate for human sporadic CRC, as it is based on stochastic and somatic modification of genes known to be important in human CRC, resulting in colonic tumors that develop in the context of the colonic microenvironment of immunocompetent mice. We have successfully used this model to stratify multiple therapeutic responses according to underlying tumor genotype (5, 6). Whereas this is a powerful approach that recreates human CRC with the utmost fidelity, it is more suitable for hypothesis-driven mechanistic interrogation of specific targeted therapies, rather than large-scale high throughput drug discovery efforts. To create a high throughput drug discovery-validation platform that closely mimics human CRC, we developed a novel GEMM-derived orthotopic transplant model that combines the capability for traditional in vitro high throughput drug screening with rapid in vivo validation in the context of a species-matched tumor-stroma microenvironment and an intact immune system. Several high throughput drug screening approaches rely on the use of pre-existing highly passaged human CRC cell lines with poorly defined genetics; in addition, investigators have utilized patient-derived tumorgraft models in which a human tumor fragment is serially passaged in an immunodeficient mouse host in order to study its biological characteristics and response to therapeutics. Here, we have utilized primary tumor tissue from our GEMMs for sporadic CRC to derive low passage, genetically-defined cell lines, thus providing a platform for rapid in vitro drug discovery. Furthermore, to facilitate rapid in vivo candidate drug validation, we developed a procedure to engraft these cell lines into the native colonic environment of immunocompetent mice, thus modeling the appropriate tumor-stroma-immune microenvironment for CRC carcinogenesis. Thus, GEMMs have become a useful system in which to recapitulate and investigate a broad spectrum of human diseases, including cancers which derive from somatic genetic events. As is the case with any model of human disease condition, there are benefits as well as limitations to GEMMs as models of human carcinogenesis. Our GEMMs of CRC have certain advantages over traditional human tumor cell lines in that they are low-passage and clearly genetically defined, as well as over human tumorgrafts, in that they can be studied within the context of a colonic environment with a fully intact immune system. Indeed, there are limitations with any GEMMs of human disease, including the possibility that there may be aspects of human CRC not fully captured within the context of the limited driver mutations we have engineered into these models. In addition, the extent to which these models recapitulate the therapeutic response seen in human CRC patients may also be incomplete. Nonetheless, we feel that a successful preclinical effort must take advantage of all possible models of the human disease condition, and that these GEMMs play a useful role within such a comprehensive effort. Since KRAS mutational status is an independent predictor of treatment response in CRC (1), we generated GEMMs of advanced CRC based on: 1) somatic loss of the tumor suppressors Apc and p53 (AP) and 2) Apc and p53 loss with concomitant gain of an activating Kras mutation (AKP). Subsequently, we derived corresponding panels of murine cell lines and demonstrated that they contain many canonical features of human CRC biology. Finally, we successfully engrafted these cell lines into the appropriate colonic microenvironment of immunocompetent mice and observed robust tumor growth and development. Here we present the development, characterization, and validation of our novel discovery-validation platform and highlight its utility by demonstrating: 1) the predisposition of Kras mutant tumors and tumor-derived cell lines towards enhanced growth and proliferation; 2) the dependency of Kras mutant tumors on oncogenic signaling; 3) the generation of a Kras signature which closely resembles several recently published CRC signatures and is enriched for hallmark CRC characteristics; 4) the propensity of Kras mutant tumors towards aerobic metabolism; and 5) how this phenotypic difference might be exploited for PET-based diagnoses of Kras mutant tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Genetically Engineered Mouse Models (GEMM). The generation and genotyping of Apc CKO, Kras LSL-G12D, and p53 flox/flox genetically engineered mice has been previously described (Supplemental Figure 1 and (5)). To generate compound mutant mice, Apc CKO and p53 flox/flox mice were crossed to generate Apc CKO p53 flox/flox (AP) mice and Apc CKO, Kras LSL-G12D, and p53 flox/flox mice were crossed to generate Apc CKO, Kras LSL-G12D, and p53 flox/flox (AKP) mice. Adenoviral Infection of the Colonic Epithelium and Endoscopy. 12-week old mice were infected with 10 9 pfu Ad5CMVcre (AdCre) (Gene Transfer Vector Core, University of Iowa) after surgical laparotomy under anesthesia (2% isoflurane), as described (5). Resulting compound genotypes and nomenclature are depicted in Supplemental Figure 1. Mice were followed with biweekly optical colonoscopy for tumor development. The Tumor Size Index (TSI) based on the relative ratio of the cross sectional areas of the tumor to that of the colonic lumen was derived as described (5, 6). Tumor-bearing mice with TSI > 75 were euthanized, and the colons were removed, opened longitudinally, and rinsed with cold PBS. Tumors fragments were isolated for genomic analysis, histology, and cell line establishment. This research protocol was approved by our attending veterinarian, by the Tufts Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and by the Tufts Medical Institutional Biosafety Committee. Derivation of Tumor Cell Lines. Tumor samples were washed in 0.04% sodium hypochlorite followed by multiple PBS-gentamycin washes. Samples were minced and digested in collagenase D/dispase (Roche), collected by centrifugation, and digested further in 0.3% pancreatin (Roche) at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. Digested samples were passed through a 40 \u00a5\u00ecm cell strainer (BD Biosciences), collected by centrifugation, re-suspended in defined culture media (DMEM, 10%FBS, 0.2 ng/ml EGF, 1X Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (Invitrogen), 2.5 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml gentamycin), and plated on 60 mm 2 collagen IV coated dishes (BD Biosciences). Mutational analysis was confirmed using our genotyping protocol as described in the Supplemental Methods. Additional detailed methods are available in the Supplement. RESULTS. Kras G12D accelerates carcinogenesis in GEMM models of sporadic CRC. Colonic tumors were induced through surgical administration of AdCre to generate Apc CKO p53 \u00a5\u00c4/\u00a5\u00c4 (AP) and APC CKO Kras G12D p53 \u00a5\u00c4\u00a5\u00c4 (AKP) tumors, respectively (Supplemental Figure S1), and followed by optical colonoscopy (Figure 1A). Whereas initial tumor formation was observed in AP mice by seven weeks after surgical induction, neoplastic lesions were detected in AKP mice in as little as two weeks. Analysis of composite tumor growth curves further confirmed more robust tumor growth in AKP compared to AP mice (Figure 1B). In addition, the rate of histologic progression was accelerated in AKP mice (Figure 1C?D). Collectively, these data suggest that somatically activated oncogenic Kras G12D promotes tumor progression in the context of an Apc CKO p53 \u00a5\u00c4\u00a5\u00c4 genetically permissive background. Kras G12D increases MAPK and PI3K/mTOR but has no effect on WNT signaling in colonic tumors. We have previously demonstrated that introduction of Kras G12D activates the downstream MAPK pathway in tumors derived from Apc mutation (5). To examine if a similar response exists in tumors harboring an additional p53 mutation, protein analysis was performed by western blot to compare levels of p-MEK and p-ERK in individual AP and AKP tumors. While levels of total MEK and ERK were equivalent, AKP tumors demonstrated elevated levels of p-MEK and p-ERK throughout their progression (Figure 2A). These findings, along with activation of PI3K and mTOR signaling, were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Figure 2B). Next, we examined nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of \u00a5\u00e2-catenin and found that tumors from both AP and AKP mice demonstrated specific accumulation relative to adjacent normal mucosa, which is indicative of aberrant WNT signaling (Supplemental Figure 2B). Taken together, these data suggest that Kras G12D activates MAPK and PI3K/mTOR signaling and accelerates tumor progression in the context of colonic tumors with Apc and p53 deficiency. AP and AKP tumor-derived cell lines are robust in vitro models for CRC. To interrogate Kras G12D CRC biology in the context of Apc and p53 deficiency, we derived low passage primary cell lines from individual AP and AKP colonic tumors. To verify proper recombination of the genetically engineered alleles, we used PCR to examine both primary tumors and cell lines. As expected, both AP and AKP primary tumors, which are comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of tumor cells, supporting stroma, and immune cells, contain a mixture of both non-recombinant and recombinant alleles. After short-term passage (P<3) in vitro, PCR analysis demonstrated uniform loss of the non-recombinant alleles (Figure 3A). This suggests that the epithelial cells harboring genetically modified alleles obtain a growth advantage in vitro and that these cells eventually dominate the cultured cell population. Next, we examined the in vitro and in vivo growth characteristics of AP and AKP cell lines. Cumulative population doublings (CPDs) demonstrate that AKP cells grow at a faster rate compared to AP cells (~0.5 vs 1.5 PDs per day, Figure 3B). To further characterize in vitro growth capabilities, AP and AKP cell lines were grown in spheroid-inducing conditions. Consistent with their ability to grow more rapidly in a monolayer, AKP lines also form larger spheroids as evidenced by microscopy as well as a viability assay (Figure 3C). Finally, we performed subcutaneous injections of AP and AKP cells into nude mice. As indicated in Figure 3D, AKP lines displayed an enhanced ability to grow in an immunocompromised in vivo setting compared to AP lines. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the addition of Kras G12D confers a growth advantage in vitro and in vivo. Mutant Kras tumor derived cell lines are dependent on oncogenic signaling. Due to elevated MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling in vivo (Figure 2), we hypothesized that Kras mutant tumor derived cell lines would also be highly dependent on oncogenic signaling. First, Kras dependency was assessed in AP and AKP cell lines, by examining the effects of two independent hairpins targeting Kras. As shown in Figure S5A, AKP cell lines exhibited a marked decrease in cell viability upon Kras knockdown using small interfering RNA, while AP cell lines were not significantly affected despite protein knockdown being comparable (Figure S5B). These results indicated that the AKP cell lines tested displayed a greater dependency on Kras than AP cell lines, which is consistent with our hypothesis of Kras mutant cell lines require oncogenic Kras for survival. To interrogate the degree of Kras-dependency in AKP cell lines in vivo, we performed inducible RNA-interference of Kras in established tumors in vivo. Following doxycycline administration, pronounced growth inhibition was observed relative to non-induced control tumors (Figure 4A). Following 4 days of doxycycline treatment, we examined tumors from both treated (n=3) and untreated (n=3) mice by Western blot. Tumors exposed to doxycline demonstrated robust knockdown of Kras and consequently loss of p-ERK, suggesting that AKP tumor growth in vivo is reliant on MAPK signaling endowed by oncogenic Kras (Figure 4B). Next we examined the effect of MAPK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition using the pathway selective small molecule inhibitors PD-0325901 and PF-04691502, respectively. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD-0325901 revealed significantly greater sensitivity (p \u00a1\u00c2 10 ?7, Figure 4C) in Kras mutant cells, while treatment with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PF-04691502 demonstrated a slightly enhanced sensitivity in Kras mutant cells to a lower dose (50 nM, p \u00a1\u00c2 0.01, Figure 4C). Subsequently, a 3-fold increase in PF-04691502 concentration had a greater impact on cell viability with AKP cells exhibiting greater sensitivity to drug treatment (p\u00a1\u00c210 ?5, Figure 4C). Treatment using combinations of each drug demonstrated an additive effect in both AKP and AP cells with AKP cells showing a marked decrease in viability when compared to non-Kras mutant AP cell lines (p\u00a1\u00c210 ?6, Figure 4C). As expected, Western blot analysis of cells exposed to individual doses of PD-0325901 and PF-04691502 demonstrated a robust attenuation of p-MAPK and p-PI3K/AKT signaling, respectively, at 6 hours (not shown) and 24 hours (Figure 4D). A decrease in both effector pathway phosphosignaling was observed in both AKP and AP cells with combinations of PD-0325901 and PF-04691502 after 6 hours of treatment (not shown); however, restoration of both p-AKT Thr308 and p-AKT Ser473 occurred only in non-Kras mutant AP cells after 24 hours (Figure 4D). In addition, the appearance of the apoptotic marker cleaved PARP arose only in AKP cells following a 24 hour treatment with either PD-0325901 or the combination of PD-0325901 and PF-04691502 (Figure 4D) and is consistent with the decreased viability observed (Figure 4C). These results suggest that an acquired or intrinsic non-Kras G12D mediated bypass mechanism confers relative resistance in AP cells through the induction of p-AKT. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Kras mutant cell line growth and viability is dependent on oncogenic signaling, as well as Kras itself. Transcriptomic analysis reveals tumor derived cell lines capture relevant signatures of human CRC. To further characterize the extent to which our GEMM models recapitulate human disease, gene expression profiling was performed on cell lines derived from 13 murine colon adenocarcinomas (analysis scheme outlined in Figure 5A). The 500 most significantly varied genes were identified using a two-sample t-test (FDR<0.05, 2-fold change) and used for hierarchical unsupervised clustering of three AP and ten AKP cell lines. As indicated in Figure 5B, cell lines clustered into two main groups and in concordance with their respective Kras genotypes. Differences in gene expression between AKP vs. AP cell lines was further refined by performing supervised clustering using a composite of published Kras gene signatures (Kras Sig, see Supplemental Methods). This approach was also able to discriminate successfully between AKP and AP status (Figure 5C). To determine if differential gene expression among AKP and AP cell lines contains any significant overlap with published comparative murine-human signature gene datasets, pairwise comparisons were made to several CRC-related and KRAS signatures (7?9). Briefly, the genes differentially expressed in AKP vs. AP were mapped to human orthologues (renamed AKP vs. AP signature, see Supplemental Table S1) and compared to humanized gene signatures of interest, including a composite KRAS signature (9), a CRC metastasis signature (10), and intestinal epithelial signatures (ISC) (11). As indicated in Figure 5D, our list of differentially expressed genes displays significant overlap with several published CRC datasets. Notably, the AKP vs. AP gene set shows a striking overlap with a composite KRAS signature dataset (Kras Sig, Figure 5C). In addition, a significant overlap was observed between our signature with two ISC signatures (Lgr5 hi and Ephb2 hi), a late TA signature, and a CRC signature derived from a murine experimental metastasis model (11). To determine whether our AKP vs. AP signature was enriched in known disease genesets or pathways, we utilized Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. The top five biological disease categories are listed in Supplemental Table S2. Top disease categories include cancer and gastrointestinal disease, as well as metabolic disease, which may contribute in part to the altered growth kinetics observed in AKP lines. Collectively, these findings suggest that our model displays many of the transcriptional and pathway characteristics observed in intestinal biology, CRC, and oncogenic Kras. Oncogenic Kras promotes an increase in cellular glucose uptake and lactate production in vitro and in vivo. To examine potential effects of mutant Kras on cellular metabolism, we measured in vitro bioenergetic activity in AP and AKP cell lines, using the ratio of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), as a surrogate metabolic determinant. These analyses indicate that AP and AKP cell lines display a differential metabolic profile. OCR/ECAR ratios from Kras mutant cell lines are significantly decreased compared to wild-type counterparts (Supplemental Figure S3B). This is the result of an increased ECAR in AKP compared to AP cell lines (Figure 6A), with OCR remaining relatively similar in the two groups (Supplemental Figure S3A). In addition, AKP cell lines displayed enhanced glucose uptake compared to AP lines (Figure 6B). Taken together, these data indicate that activating Kras mutation may affect the metabolic characteristics of these cell lines. Given this differential metabolic profile in vitro, we wished to confirm this finding in vivo. To this end, we prepared subcutaneous tumors from AP and AKP cell lines. Upon tumor formation, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was administered via tail vein injection and mice were imaged by positron emission tomography (PET). As anticipated, FDG-PET produced an appreciable signal in heart (H), spine (S), and tumor (T). As indicated in Figure 6C, subcutaneous tumors from Kras mutant AKP lines produced a significantly higher FDG-PET signal. In addition, both mean and maximum calculated standardized uptake values (SUV) were greater in AKP lines (Supplemental Figures S3C and D). To determine if oncogenic Kras contributed to a concomitant increase in lactate production, intra-tumor lactate concentration was measured biochemically. Subcutaneous tumors from Kras mutant AKP cell lines had significantly more lactate than those with wild-type Kras (Figure 6D), a finding consistent with the Warburg Effect (12). Taken together, this data indicates that oncogenic Kras contributes to enhanced glucose uptake and glycolytic metabolism in our model system. In addition, given these findings, we performed a further investigation of our transcriptomic data to assess whether glucose transporters were differentially regulated. Indeed, the glucose transporter SLC2A1 (GLUT-1) is differentially expressed in our Kras mutant models, as indicated in Figure S6, further suggesting that alterations in Kras may lead to dysregulation of relevant metabolic programs. Intrasplenic injection of cell lines results in tumor formation at an orthotopic metastatic site. Given that the common therapeutic approach to treating advanced CRC is to treat the metastatic sites, we sought to determine whether our GEMM tumor cell lines could recapitulate metastatic growth. To this end, we performed intrasplenic injections of two independent AKP cell lines and observed growth in the liver. As indicated in Figure S4, both lines created appreciable tumor masses in the liver, as indicated by gross pathology, H&E staining and PET/CT (Figures S4A, B and C, repectively). Thus, these results demonstrate that our GEMM tumor cell line models can be utilized to test future preclinical therapeutic strategies for treating metastatic lesions. Orthotopic transplantation of cell lines into the distal colon results in invasive adenocarcinoma. To create an orthotopic model of invasive adenocarcinoma in an immunocompetent host, we established a method for transplanting cell lines derived from primary colonic tumors into the native colonic environment of a syngeneic immunocompetent recipient host mouse (see Supplemental Methods). A representative endoscopic image of a tumor established from an injection of AKP cells is shown in Figure S2A. Resulting tumors were excised after 5 weeks and sectioned. As indicated in Figure S2B, H&E sections of tumor and adjacent normal tissue indicated that these tumors are poorly differentiated, while immunohistochemical analysis found that tumor regions contained elevated nuclear \u00a5\u00e2-catenin and phosphorylated constituents of the MAPK pathway compared to adjacent normal tissue, markers of deregulated WNT signaling, and colonic transformation. Furthermore, staining for Ki67 and PECAM (CD31), markers of mitosis and angiogenesis, respectively, indicated an elevated proliferation rate and angiogenic response within tumor areas, as compared to adjacent normal colon tissue (Figure S2B). DISCUSSION. Activating KRAS mutations are commonly seen in 40?50% of human CRC (13). Whereas the prognostic role of such mutations is controversial, it is evident that they are powerful positive predictors for resistance to treatment with anti-EGFR therapies, such as cetuximab or panitumumab (14, 15). Because of the central role for KRAS in EGFR and other receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways during CRC carcinogenesis (16), robust KRAS-specific treatments are desperately needed for effective CRC treatment. As such efforts have been widely unsuccessful to date (17), the development of novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of KRAS mutant CRC is a critical unmet clinical need. Despite the identification of many candidate drug compounds during pre-clinical discovery efforts, the subsequent rate of success through the clinical trial pipeline is abysmal (18). Traditional preclinical drug discovery platforms often rely on genetically undefined and highly passaged human tumor cell lines. The in vitro discovery phase is often followed by in vivo validation in immunodeficient mice that suffer from complete species mismatch in the tumor microenvironment. This is a significant shortcoming in light of the increasing evidence implicating the critical interplay between the tumor, its supporting stroma, and the surrounding immununological milieu (19). As the highest failure rate occurs during phase II testing when clinical efficacy in humans is first directly tested, preclinical models that are better surrogates for human disease are needed (20). GEMMs possessing conditional alleles that recapitulate mutations known to be important in human disease provide an attractive and powerful alternative, as they recapitulate the full histologic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic spectrum of disease seen in human disease (21, 22). Indeed, numerous successful cancer discovery and validation efforts have been possible through the use of comprehensive comparative oncogenomic and oncoproteomic analyses (22?26). Furthermore, such GEMMs can be used to derive highly successful predictions of eventual therapeutic response in human disease (5, 27). Whereas GEMMs are excellent surrogates for human disease, they are more suited for specific hypothesis-driven efforts rather than high throughput screening. To address this deficiency, we wished to develop a composite platform comprised of 1) high throughput in vitro screening based on CRC GEMMs and 2) closely linked in vivo validation that faithfully recapitulates human disease. Many CRC GEMMs utilize germline or tissue-wide modification of genes involved in human carcinogenesis that paradoxically results in a high multiplicity of predominantly small intestinal tumors (28). Whereas GEMM-derived cell lines have been described for models of lung and pancreatic cancer (29), CRC GEMM-derived cell lines have not. This may because the large tumor burden in most CRC GEMMs results in premature death, thereby precluding the isolation and characterization of distinct tumor material that is amenable to generation of viable cell lines. Here, we have characterized two novel CRC GEMMs that present with a very low multiplicity of large advanced primary colonic tumors, making these an ideal basis for derivation of cell lines to incorporate into our GEMM derived orthotopic model. We used primary colonic tumor tissue from these two GEMMs to successfully generate low passage cell lines that recapitulate many canonical features of human CRC. In addition, low-passage cell lines derived from primary tumors recapitulate this enhanced proliferative phenotype when propagated in vitro, as well as in subcutaneous space in vivo. Gene expression signatures generated from these low passage Kras mutant cell lines are highly concordant with several signatures associated with KRAS mutation, as well as enhanced proliferation, metastasis, and stem-cell signatures, providing evidence for common biology between our model system and CRC. Furthermore, our CRC GEMM expression signatures are highly enriched for biological functions and processes associated with human cancer, gastrointestinal disease, and altered metabolism. Taken together, these findings suggest that the cell lines derived from primary GEMM tumors recapitulate many canonical features of human CRC biology and are a robust foundation for our orthotpopic model. Whereas traditional xenograft models suffer from complete species mismatch in the tumor microenvironment, our strategy permits engraftment into immunocompetent, syngeneic hosts. Multiple approaches to develop orthotopic transplant models in mice have been described, including cecal and colonic injections (30?32). Unfortunately, these strategies employ subepithelial injection of tumor cells into the supporting stroma, which is not the native microenvironment for CRC carcinogenesis. Here, we describe a method in which we disrupt the native colonic epithelium, thereby permitting robust and reproducible cell line engraftment in the colonic epithelial compartment. Further, our model allows for the development and reimplantation of syngeneic tumor cells using any number of genetic combinations. Limitations intrinsic to the model itself may include a lack of genetic heterogeneity due to the finite number of initial driver mutations built into the model, as well as, potential for the tumors themselves to manifest a limited level of intratumoral heterogeneity, as compared to human CRC counterparts. To better recapitulate such heterogeneity, implantation of a mixture of primary cell cultures that derive from independent tumor models could be implemented in the future. there are limitations intrinsic to the model itself, including a lack of genetic heterogeneity due to the finite number of driver lesions built into the model, as well as potential for the tumors themselves to manifest a limited level of intratumoral heterogeneity compared to human CRC counterparts. Nonetheless, we have developed a platform that allows for the validation of findings from high throughput in vitro screens in an in vivo setting that recapitulates CRC carcinogenesis in its native environment. Given the lack of success in generating selective pharmacological against oncogenic KRAS, several efforts have attempted to identify potential synthetic lethal targets (33?36). To this end, the Kras wild type and mutant models of CRC described and characterized herein will provide future functional screening efforts aimed at identifying and, more critically, validating (37, 38) such synthetic lethal targets in KRAS mutant CRC. In addition, the ability to transplant these low passage cell lines back into the relevant colonic microenvironment and reconstitute a colorectal tumor will provide an invaluable platform for future functional screening efforts to identify putative therapeutic targets using RNAi or genetically engineered gain-of-function approaches. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the feasibility of asking sophisticated hypothesis-driven gain-of-function and loss-of-function questions using relatively simple in vitro genetic manipulations that can be rapidly validated in vivo. In this manner, we can circumvent some of the limitations of traditional CRC GEMMs that require laborious targeting of embryonic stem cells and/or cumbersome mouse breeding. Activation of oncogenes and/or loss of tumor suppressor genes such as KRAS (39), MYC (40), and TP53 (41) increase glucose uptake and lactate production. These observations are consistent with the \u00a1\u00aeWarburg effect\u00a1\u00af that stipulates that tumor cells rely mainly on aerobic glycolysis to generate ATP instead of the metabolically more efficient mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (12). Therefore, mutations in diverse oncogenic pathways may affect glucose utilization by tumor cells. Consequently, FDG-PET has been employed as a diagnostic tool to detect metabolically active foci, which are representative of cancer cell dissemination in the clinical setting (42). Given the prevalence of metabolic pathway enrichment in our transcriptome analysis, we wished to determine whether the activation of oncogenic Kras enhanced metabolic activity in our model system. In support of an altered metabolic state, our functional analyses found that Kras mutant cell lines demonstrate decreased in vitro OCR/ECAR ratios, increased in vitro and in vivo FDG-PET signal, and increased in vivo lactate production. These findings are consistent with a metabolic shift towards increased aerobic glycolysis, termed the Warburg effect (43), and are concordant with recent findings implicating a role for oncogenic KRAS in a shift toward increased glycolysis and glucose consumption (44) This shift in metabolism is thought to provide cancer cells with a growth advantage in the tumor microenvironment, (45), and it has been suggested that aerobic glycolysis can contribute to malignant transformation (46). Furthermore, this finding highlights the potential of FDG-PET for non-invasive discrimination between KRAS mutant and non-mutant CRC metastases. Thus, our Kras mutant GEMM model presents with several phenotypes of KRAS mutant CRC, including enhanced proliferation, heightened signaling through MAPK and PI3K pathways, and an increased propensity towards aerobic metabolism. In conclusion, we present here the establishment of two genetically defined models of sporadic CRC biology, including one that displays several hallmark traits of KRAS driven CRC. These findings provide evidence that this model system faithfully recapitulates human CRC, thereby making it a highly desirable platform for preclinical therapeutic target identification for KRAS CRC and subsequent in vivo validation. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE. Treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) with activating KRAS mutations represents a critical unmet clinical need. To evaluate the efficacy of experimental therapeutics in KRAS mutant CRC, we previously developed novel genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for Kras mutant and non-mutant sporadic CRC. To facilitate high throughput screening, we have generated low passage cell lines derived from our GEMM primary colonic tumors under defined conditions. Kras mutant and non-mutant tumor-derived cell lines demonstrated phenotypic differences in tumor growth, dependency on oncogenic signaling, and metabolism. Transcriptomic analysis revealed close intersection with human KRAS CRC biology. Furthermore, we developed an innovative approach to transplant our cell lines into the native colonic microenvironment of immunocompetent mice, resulting in rapid, reproducible, and tractable tumor formation. Taken together, these features provide a complementary platform for large-scale and comprehensive drug discovery efforts. Supplementary Material. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Lysosome-dependent p300/FOXP3 degradation and limits T reg cell functions and enhances targeted therapy against cancers\tp300 is one of several acetyltransferases that regulate FOXP3 acetylation and functions. Our recent studies have defined a complex set of histone acetyltransferase interactions which can lead to enhanced or repressed changes in FOXP3 function. We have explored the use of a natural p300 inhibitor, Garcinol, as a tool to understand mechanisms by which p300 regulates FOXP3 acetylation. In the presence of Garcinol, p300 appears to become disassociated from the FOXP3 complex and undergoes lysosome-dependent degradation. As a consequence of p300's physical absence, FOXP3 becomes less acetylated and eventually degraded, a process that cannot be rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. p300 plays a complex role in FOXP3 acetylation, as it could also acetylate a subset of four Lys residues that repressively regulate total FOXP3 acetylation. Garcinol acts as a degradation device to reduce the suppressive activity of regulatory T cells (T reg) and to enhance the in vivo anti-tumor activity of a targeted therapeutic anti-p185 her2/neu (ERBB2) antibody in MMTV-neu transgenics implanted with neu transformed breast tumor cells. Our studies provide the rationale for molecules that disrupt p300 stability to limit T reg functions in targeted therapies for cancers. Introduction. FOXP3 (Forkhead box P3) is a member of the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcription regulators regulatory T (T reg) cells' development and function (Ziegler, 2006). While mouse has only one isoform, human FOXP3 includes two isoforms, FOXP3a and FOXP3b (Allan et al., 2005; Ziegler, 2006). Both the expression level and stability of the FOXP3 protein play crucial roles in T reg differentiation and suppressive functions (Li and Greene, 2007; Wan and Flavell, 2007; Williams and Rudensky, 2007). Loss of FOXP3 function limits T reg cell functionalities and can promote lethal auto-aggressive lymphoproliferation, and overexpression of FOXP3 limits immune responses (Hori et al., 2003; Merlo et al., 2009). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation have been shown to occur on many transcriptional factors and affect transcriptional activity by regulating protein stability, subcellular localization, oligomerization, or DNA binding (Li and Greene, 2007). FOXP3 lysine \u00a5\u00e5-acetylation is an important post-translational modification that regulates FOXP3 expression levels and functions in T reg cells (Beier et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012b). At least two histone acetyltransferases (HAT), including Tat-interactive protein (Tip60, also known as KAT5) and p300, promote FOXP3 acetylation (Li et al., 2007; van Loosdregt et al., 2010; Xiao et al., 2010). Acetylated forms of FOXP3 appear to be more resistant to polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and move from the nucleoplasm to the chromatin (Li et al., 2007; Samanta et al., 2008; van Loosdregt et al., 2010). Garcinol, a polyisoprenylated benzophenone derivative from the fruit rind of Garcinia indica, has been claimed to represent a natural inhibitor of p300 and possibly other enzymes (Balasubramanyam et al., 2004). Garcinol inhibits p300 auto-acetylation as well as p300-mediated p53 acetylation (Arif et al., 2007; Mantelingu et al., 2007). We now discover that Garcinol induces physical degradation of p300, not through the proteasome but the lysosomal degradation processes. The study of Garcinol and FOXP3 has revealed that degradation of p300 leads to more dramatic effects on phenotypic changes in T reg cells beyond the post transcriptional modification of FOXP3. Materials and methods. Reagents. Garcinol and Bafilomycin A1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Chloroquine diphosphate salt and MG-132 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA), respectively. FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 and PE-conjugated anti-CD25 were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, Ca). APC-conjugated anti mouse CD45RB was purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA). Cell culture and transfection. H2N113 is a mouse breast tumor cell line derived from 20- to 23-week-old female BALB/c MMTV-ErbB-2/neuT transgenic mice (Stagg et al., 2008). H2N113 and the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco, Grand Island, NY). H2N113 was further supplemented with 1\u00a1\u00bf sodium pyruvate, Glutamax and MEM NEAA (all from Gibco). Cells were maintained at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C in a 95% humidified incubator containing 5% CO 2. For transfection, cells were transfected with expression plasmids (3 \u00a5\u00ecg each) in a 10-cm dish using the Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were subjected to treatment with inhibitors 24 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed by lysis buffer (20 mM Tris?Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 420 mM NaCl, 400 nM TSA,10 mM Nicotinamide, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF) in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), followed by immunoprecipitation with Acetylated-Lysine antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). For co-immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG mAb, whole cell lysates were first pre-cleared using control IgG and Protein A/G-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) after rotation at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C for 0.5 h and centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4 \u00a1\u00c6C for 1 min. Pre-cleared cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG mAb M2 (Sigma) and Protein A/G-Agarose. Total lysates and immunoprecipitated samples were separated on 6% or 10% glycine SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. For Western blot analysis, anti-HA-HRP antibody (Roche), anti-Flag-HRP (cloneM2) and Anti-\u00a5\u00e2-actin-HRP antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), Acetylated-Lysine antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at dilutions suggested by the manufacturers. The antigen-antibody complex was revealed with Millipore Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore Corporation, MA). Cell proliferation assay. To measure cell proliferation, we used the modified 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]- 2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as previously described (Masuda et al., 2006). Briefly, H2N113 cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates and treated with different concentration of 7.16.4 antibody and/or Garcinol for 3 days at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Old culture medium was replaced with 100 \u00a5\u00ecL fresh medium and incubated for 4 h at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C. 25 \u00a5\u00ecL of MTT solution (5mg/mL in PBS) were added to each well. After 2 h of incubation at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C, 100 \u00a5\u00ecL of extraction buffer (20% w/v SDS, 50% N,N-dimethyl formamide, pH 4.7) was added. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using an ELISA reader. In vivo tumor studies. All mouse procedures were performed according to the guidelines and protocols approved by the IACUC of University of Pennsylvania. 6?8 week old female MMTV-neu/FOXP3-GFP mice, which express the oncogenic neu under the MMTV promoter, were used as the syngeneic host of the H2N113 tumor line. Tumors were developed by s.c. injection of 1\u00a1\u00bf 10 6 H2N113 cells in the flank region of mice. After 10 days, mice were treated with Garcinol and/or 7.16.4 antibody by intraperitoneal injection twice weekly. Control mice were injected with PBS. Tumor size was measured with a Vernier caliper, and tumor volume was calculated by the formula: 3.14 * length * width *height/6. In vitro T reg suppression assay. CD4 + T cells were enriched by MACS CD4 + T cell isolation kit II (Miltenyi) from the spleen of C57BL/6 mice. CD4 +CD25 ?CD45RB high effecter T cells (T eff) and CD4 + CD25 high regulatory T cells (T reg) of spleen were isolated by FACS Aria II, yielding a purity of ~97% for both types of cells. T eff were labeled with CFSE (Invitrogen) and co-cultured with different ratio of T reg, anti-CD3/CD28 beads (Invitrogen), with or without Garcinol (2 or 4 \u00a5\u00ecM), in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 1\u00a1\u00bf non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 2 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) and 50 \u00a5\u00ecM \u00a5\u00e2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). After 3 days of co-culture, cells were harvested and in vitro proliferation of lymphocytes was analyzed by FACSCanto Flow Cytometry. Results. Inhibition of p300 by Garcinol leads to degradation of p300 and influences FOXP3 acetylation. Since both cellular FOXP3 level and transcriptional activity are affected by acetylation (Li et al., 2007; Song et al., 2012) and p300 is known to regulate FOXP3 acetylation (van Loosdregt et al., 2010), we investigated the effects of the p300 inhibitor Garcinol on FOXP3 activity. HEK 293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged FOXP3 (HA-FOXP3a) and Flag-tagged p300 (Flag-p300). Cells were treated with different doses of Garcinol (0?25 \u00a5\u00ecM) for 4 h. Acetylation of FOXP3 and p300 were examined by immunoprecipitation (IP) of acetylated proteins from cell lysate using an anti-acetyl lysine antibody and blotted with anti-HA and anti-Flag antibody for FOXP3 and p300, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, FOXP3 acetylation was minimal in the absence of p300. Co-expression with p300 enhanced acetylation as well as the protein abundance of FOXP3. Acetylation of both FOXP3 and p300 was reduced by Garcinol in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1A, Ac-K IP). Unexpectedly, the p300 expression level, as determined by anti-FLAG blot from the total lysate, was also clearly reduced by Garcinol. p300 proteins in the lysate were reduced quantitatively by 15 \u00a5\u00ecM of Garcinol and became undetectable after treatment with 25 \u00a5\u00ecM of Garcinol. No reduction of the FOXP3 protein level was observed at 15 \u00a5\u00ecM of Garcinol. In the presence of 25 \u00a5\u00ecM of Garcinol, when p300 was maximally degraded, the FOXP3 level was reduced and became comparable with that of control transfection (pFLAG, no ectopically expressed p300, no Garcinol treatment). Clearly Garcinol induces p300 degradation and subsequently influences both FOXP3 acetylation levels and stability. We studied the interaction between p300 and FOXP3 by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). Lysates from cells with co-expression of p300 and FOXP3 were first precipitated with the anti-Flag antibody for p300 and probed with the anti-HA antibody for FOXP3. As shown in Fig. 1B, Garcinol limited the interaction between p300 and FOXP3. At 15 \u00a5\u00ecM Garcinol, the amount of precipitated p300 was comparable with that in the control (no Garcinol treatment), but less FOXP3 proteins were associated with p300. At 25 \u00a5\u00ecM Garcinol, there were still some p300 proteins in the co-IP but FOXP3 became indiscernible. Garcinol promotes the disassembly of the FOXP3-p300 complex while driving p300 into degradation. Garcinol-mediated degradation of p300 is prevented by Chloroquine. FOXP3 degradation is thought to be mediated primarily through proteasomal pathways (van Loosdregt et al., 2010). To determine whether Garcinol-induced p300 degradation is promoted by proteasomal processes or by other mechanisms, we examined several inhibitors of protein degradation, including MG132, Chloroquine, E-64, pepstatin A, and PMSF (Fig. S1). Chloroquine, but not MG132 or any other inhibitors, efficiently blocked Garcinol-mediated p300 degradation. As shown in Fig. 2A, Chloroquine dose-dependently reversed the effect of Garcinol on both p300 and FOXP3 in terms of both protein and acetylation levels. FOXP3 acetylation was clearly observed when 5 \u00a5\u00ecM or more Chloroquine was present as compared with cells treated with 25 \u00a5\u00ecM Garcinol alone. Complete blocking of p300 degradation was observed with 20 \u00a5\u00ecM Chloroquine. Interestingly, although Garcinol was able to prevent p300 from acetylating substrates (Balasubramanyam et al., 2004), it did not affect auto-acetylation of p300. As shown in Fig. 2A, acetylation of Garcinol treated-p300 was detectable once p300 degradation was blocked by Chloroquine. The effect of MG132 on FOXP3 degradation was complex. At 5 \u00a5\u00ecM, a level that is routinely used to block proteasome-mediated protein degradation (van Loosdregt et al., 2010), MG132 was not able to counteract Garcinol on FOXP3 acetylation and stability (Fig. 2A). At higher concentrations (>20 \u00a5\u00ecM), MG132 promoted FOXP3 degradation, as well as the degradation of the control protein \u00a5\u00e2-actin, indicating a broad, non-specific outcome that may be related to the presence of both Garcinol and MG132. Interestingly, acetylation of FOXP3 was increased at higher MG132 concentrations, despite the reduced FOXP3 protein levels. Acetylated forms of FOXP3 appeared to be more stable. Clearly, these studies indicate that Garcinol promotes the entry of p300 into a lysosome-mediated protein degradation pathway, indirectly leading to reduced acetylation of FOXP3. The influence of Garcinol on the FOXP3 protein level is limited as compared with that on p300. Although massive destruction of FOXP3 was not observed in the presence of Garcinol, the reduction of FOXP3 protein levels accompanying the loss of p300 also appeared to be lysosomally related. To further confirm the role of Chloroquine in the degradation of p300, we utilized bafilomycin A1. Bafilomycin A1 inhibits the initial localization of Chloroquine to acidic vesicles, thus blocking Chloroquine from disrupting lysosomal function (Boya et al., 2003). Bafilomycin A1 alone slightly promoted p300 degradation (Fig. 2B, lane 2 vs lane 7). While Chloroquine prevented Garcinol-induced p300 degradation (lane 2B vs lane 2), bafilomycin A1 attenuated the effect of Chloroquine (Fig. 2B, lane 5), leading to reduced acetylated p300 signals noted after anti-acetyl lysine immunoprecipitation as well as reduced total p300 protein levels in the lysate (Fig. 2B). Degradation of FOXP3 after Garcinol treatment is not dependent on acetylation of FOXP3 by ectopic p300. We next examined if the Garcinol effect was only dependent on ectopic expression of p300. For this purpose, HEK 293T cells were transfected with HA-FOXP3a only. As shown in Fig. 3A, Garcinol was able to reduce FOXP3 acetylation in a dose dependent manner, and Chloroquine reversed the Garcinol effect on FOXP3 (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with our observation that FOXP3 can be acetylated by endogenous acetyltransferases but to a lesser extent than with ectopically over-expressed p300. Previously we have identified K250/K252 in human FOXP3 as an important acetylation site for p300 (Song et al., 2012). Mutations on these two sites greatly reduce FOXP3 acetylation by p300. We investigated the effect of Garcinol on the FOXP3 K250R/K252R mutant. As shown in Fig. 3B, although the acetylation level of this mutant was reduced as compared with the wild type FOXP3 (Fig. 3A), Garcinol was still able to reduce acetylation of this mutant, and degradation of FOXP3 by Garcinol was prevented by the addition of Chloroquine. For both the wild type FOXP3 (Fig. 3A) and the K250R/K252R mutant (Fig. 3B), MG132 at 5 \u00a5\u00ecM further increased Garcinol-induced FOXP3 degradation. Acetylation of the FOXP3 K250R/K252R mutant indicates that there exist additional acetylation sites for p300. It is also possible that other endogenous acetyltransferases are involved in the acetylation of FOXP3, and Garcinol can also inhibit these acetyltransferases. We have observed synergistic effects of p300 and TIP60 on FOXP3 (Xiao et al., in preparation). Garcinol as a broad spectrum acetyltransferase inhibitor. Garcinol was reported to inhibit p300 and P/CAF (also known as KAT2B) with comparable activity (IC50: 7 and 5 \u00a5\u00ecM, respectively) (Mantelingu et al., 2007). Garcinol was also observed to inhibit TIP60 at comparable levels to anarcadic acid (IC50: Garcinol = 12 \u00a5\u00ecM, anarcadic acid = 6 \u00a5\u00ecM) (Arun Dutta, personal communication). We compared the inhibitory activity of Garcinol on several acetyltransferases in our cell-based system and examined the acetylation level by immunoprecipitation with the anti-acetyl lysine antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, Garcinol inhibited all enzymes (p300, CBP (also known as CREBBP), TIP60 and P/CAF) to some extent. Among these enzymes, p300 was the most sensitive to Garcinol inhibition. At 15 \u00a5\u00ecM, Garcinol clearly inhibited both protein level and acetylation level of p300. TIP60 was also sensitive to Garcinol, but only the acetylation level was reduced by 15 \u00a5\u00ecM Garcinol. At 25 \u00a5\u00ecM, Garcinol reduced only P/CAF acetylation and barely affected the protein level. CBP was the most resistant to Garcinol, with both acetylation and protein levels still readily detectable in 25 \u00a5\u00ecM Garcinol. We had shown earlier that 25 \u00a5\u00ecM Garcinol completely abolished FOXP3 acetylation levels (Fig. 1). At this concentration, Garcinol affected both p300 and TIP60, but not CBP and P/CAF levels. Taken together, this study indicates that both p300 and TIP60 may be more relevant to regulation of FOXP3 than P/CAF and CBP. Mutations on FOXP3 that increase acetylation and stability render FOXP3 more susceptible to Garcinol-induced degradation. We have identified four Lys residues that affect acetylation of FOXP3: K31, K179, K227, and K268. When any of these Lys residues was substituted with the same positively charged Arg residue, acetylation of FOXP3 as well as the total protein levels were increased (Fig. 3C). Although protein levels of these mutants were not significantly affected by Garcinol, acetylation of these FOXP3 mutants was much more susceptible to inhibition by Garcinol (15 \u00a5\u00ecM) than that of the wild type FOXP3 (Fig. 3D). Treatment of Garcinol induced more significant reduction in acetylation levels in these FOXP3 mutants, especially the K31R mutant. Our study concluded that these 4 Lys play a negative role in the overall acetylation levels of FOXP3. The mutants might be much more accessible to acetyltransferases and thus had much higher acetylation levels. However, the elevated acetylation levels were sustained by endogenous acetyltransferases such as p300 and TIP60. When these enzymes were inhibited and degraded by Garcinol, the acetylation level of FOXP3 was then quickly reduced. Inhibition of T reg functions by Garcinol. We next examined whether Garcinol affected T reg suppressive function. Mouse CD4 +CD25 high T reg cells were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and used to study their activity to suppress the proliferation of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)?labeled primary CD4 +CD25 ?CD45RB high T cells (representing effector T cells, T eff) (Fig. 5). T eff and T reg cells were mixed at different ratios. The proliferative population of T eff were compared between all treatments. T reg cells inhibited the proliferation of T eff cells in a dose-dependent manner. Modest intrinsic inhibitory activity of Garcinol on T eff was noted even in the absence of T reg cells. Effector cells were slightly less proliferative when incubated with Garcinol (data not shown). The population of proliferative T eff cell was reduced from 54% in the control to 48.3% and 38.4% in the presence of 2 \u00a5\u00ecM and 4 \u00a5\u00ecM Garcinol, respectively. Nevertheless, after the population of dividing T eff under different conditions was normalized to that of T eff cells treated only by Garcinol (Fig. 5), it was obvious that Garcinol treatment reduced the suppressive activity of T reg cells and led to more proliferative T eff cells. The Garcinol effect was more obvious when there were less T reg cells in the mixture, e.g. at the T eff/T reg ratio of 16:1 and 8:1. Synergistic activity of Garcinol and anti-p185 her2/neu in the treatment of tumors in vivo. p185 her2/neu is a member of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases and has been validated as a clinical target for breast and stomach cancers. Monoclonal antibodies to the oncoprotein of rat origin were developed to establish the foundation for targeted therapies to solid tumors (Drebin et al., 1984, 1986). One of the monoclonal antibodies, mAb7.16.4, has a shared epitope with trastuzumab, a FDA approved therapeutic agent in clinical use (Zhang et al., 1999). 7.16.4 is active on Erbb2/neu transformed rodent and human tumors in a variety of assays (Cai et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 1999). 7.16.4 has been used in many labs around the world in transgenic animal models of tumors induced by the neu oncogene (Katsumata et al., 1995; Park et al., 2010; Stagg et al., 2011). Recent studies defined a role for CD8+ IFN-\u00a5\u00e3-secreting cells and NK ADCC mediating cells as contributory elements in 7.16.4 therapy of implanted tumor model of neu transformed cells (Park et al., 2010; Stagg et al., 2011). It is expected that both active innate and adaptive immune cells that translocate and reside in the tumors contribute to the anti-cancer activity of 7.16.4 and trastuzumab. In addition we have noted the presence of infiltrated FOXP3+ T cells in tumor tissues (unpublished) and others have noted that FOXP3+ T cells may affect the growth of transplanted neu transformed cells in rodent model of tumor evasion (Kerkar and Restifo, 2012; Zhang et al., 2012a). We examined whether Garcinol, which promotes degradation of p300 and contributes to FOXP3 loss, could enhance 7.16.4 anti-tumor activity. The target tumor cell line H2N113 was established from the tumor of MMTV-neu transgenic mice (Stagg et al., 2011). In vitro proliferation assay demonstrated that 7.16.4 could inhibit H2N113 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). We did note that Garcinol slightly inhibited the proliferation of H2N113. However, Garcinol was not able to enhance the activity of 7.16.4 in this in vitro assay. In vivo activity of Garcinol was studied in a transplant model. We implanted H2N113 tumor cells into BALB/c-MMTV-neu/FOXP3-GFP mice as reported previously (Stagg et al., 2011). Treatment began when tumors were apparent (10 days after tumor inoculation). Mice were treated with 7.16.4, at either low dose (1.8 mg/kg) or high dose (9 mg/kg), twice weekly. As shown in Fig. 6B, the high dose 7.16.4 treatment alone significantly reduced the tumor growth. The growth of tumor appeared to be only modestly reduced by the low dose 7.16.4 treatment. While Garcinol (43.6 mg/kg) had little discernible effects on the growth of tumors, the combination of Garcinol and low dose 7.16.4 led to enhanced inhibition of tumor growth. These data indicate that the inhibitory activity of Garcinol on T reg function has a positive effect on anti-p185 her2/neu antibody targeted therapy. Discussion. Garcinol-induced p300 degradation leads to FOXP3 hypo-acetylation. FOXP3 plays a key role in maintaining T reg cells' functions and represents a therapeutic target to regulate T reg cells. Our laboratory identified acetylation as one mechanism to regulate FOXP3 stability. Clearly enzymes that are involved in the acetylation or deacetylation of FOXP3 represent targets that may lead to manipulation of FOXP3 functions. For example, the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor VPA has been studied as an enhancer for T reg function (de Zoeten et al., 2010, 2011; Saouaf et al., 2009). p300 and TIP60 are two acetyltransferases that synergistically affect FOXP3 acetylation levels (Xiao et al., in preparation). To understand if FOXP3 can be regulated by inhibiting acetyltransferases, we have studied Garcinol, a natural compound that was initially identified as an inhibitor for p300. Garcinol leads to rapid degradation of p300 via a lysosome dependent mechanism, as Chloroquine but not MG132 can prevent the Garcinol induced degradation. After Garcinol-mediated degradation was blocked by Chloroquine, p300 acetylation was easily detected. Our studies indicate that lack of acetylation is not the mechanism to sort p300 for degradation via the lysosome pathway. p300 degradation has been investigated previously (Chen and Li, 2011). Changes in acetylation as well as phosphorylation of p300 have been shown to associate with the degradation of p300 (Jain et al., 2012; Poizat et al., 2005). We report here for the first time the involvement of the lysosome pathway in the degradation of p300. FOXP3 acetylation levels are affected by p300 degradation (Fig. 1). In the presence of 15 \u00a5\u00ecM Garcinol, the FOXP3 protein level is not affected but the acetylation level is reduced. The FOXP3 level itself is eventually reduced by higher concentration of Garcinol (25 \u00a5\u00ecM). Loss of FOXP3 acetylation precedes degradation, which is consistent with our observation that acetylation of FOXP3 increases its stability (van Loosdregt et al., 2010) (Xiao et al., manuscript in preparation). The acetyltransferase activity is not critical for p300 to interact with FOXP3. This study reveals that Garcinol achieves its effect on FOXP3 independently of inhibiting the enzymatic activity of p300. When the degradation of p300 is arrested by Chloroquine treatment, FOXP3 acetylation is readily detected even in the presence of Garcinol and inactivated p300 enzymatic activity (Fig. 2). Chloroquine does not interfere with p300 enzymatic activity, as it only inhibits the lysosomal degradation process. FOXP3 acetylation and stability is dependent on the presence of the intact p300 protein but not linked to p300 enzymatic activity. Our own work and that of others have established that p300 interacts with FOXP3 (van Loosdregt et al., 2010). Our co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 1B) indicate that Garcinol interferes with the interaction between p300 and FOXP3. In addition, in separate studies we observed that the acetyltransferase-deficient p300 could interact with FOXP3 as well as the wild type p300 did in co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. S2). The role of lysosome in the regulation of p300/FOXP3. Proteasome mediated degradation is one mechanistic operation to regulate FOXP3 levels, as the proteasome inhibitor MG132 modifies the steady state FOXP3 levels (van Loosdregt et al., 2010). MG132 could not rescue Garcinol-mediated p300 or FOXP3 degradation. At higher concentrations (20?50 \u00a5\u00ecM), MG132 even increases FOXP3 degradation (Fig. 2). We do not think that the effect of the high dose MG132 is specific to FOXP3, as the protein levels of \u00a5\u00e2-actin were also reduced, indicating a general cytotoxicity related to high MG132 concentration in the presence of Garcinol. Interestingly, the acetylation level of FOXP3 is increased despite the reduced protein level, reflecting that the acetylated form is more stable than the non-acetylated FOXP3. Our study reveals for the first time that lysosome also plays an important role to maintain FOXP3, primarily by regulating p300 levels. A repressive model of regulatory Lys residues for FOXP3 acetylation. Kwon and colleagues reported three acetylation sites in mouse Foxp3: K31, K262 and K267 (Kwon et al., 2012). p300 and the deacetylase SIRT1 appeared to regulate acetylation on K31 and K262, as the presence of either p300 or the SIRT1 specific inhibitor Ex-527 enhanced acetylation on these sites. The corresponding sites in human FOXP3 are K31, K263, and K268, respectively. Consistently, we also observed elevated stability and acetylation levels for K31R and K268R FOXP3 mutants. In addition, two other sites (K179 and K227) may also play similar roles in the regulation of FOXP3 stability (Fig. 3). It was suggested that these Lys residues might also be ubiquitination sites on FOXP3 (Kwon et al., 2012). Acetylation of Lys or substitution with Arg would prevent ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation of FOXP3. However, this \u00a1\u00b0competitive\u00a1\u00b1 model is not consistent with our findings. If these sites were equally accessible to ubiquitination, we would not expect to observe such a dramatic increase in FOXP3 protein level with a single Arg substitution. In addition, if the ubiquitination sites were eliminated by Arg substitution, we would expect to observe reduced ubiquitination levels in mutants. In contrast, the K227R and K268R FOXP3 mutants were shown to have increased ubiquitination accompanying elevated total FOXP3 levels (Fig. S3). Acetylation on these Lysines may be repressive and prevent acetylation on additional Lys sites that are more directly involved in FOXP3 stability. As shown in Fig. 3, mutation of any of these sites leads to a significant increase in total FOXP3 acetylation. p300 alone may not be sufficient to acetylate FOXP3. In studies to be published separately it is the formation of heteroacetylase complexes which determine the acetylation patterns per se. p300 may be involved in FOXP3 stability as a chaperone-like binding partner, although its enzymatic activity is also required for its cooperation with TIP60 to regulate some FOXP3 functionalities (Xiao et al., manuscript in preparation). Garcinol as a potential inhibitor of FOXP3 and T reg functions for cancer therapies. Garcinol affects the FOXP3 stability by causing lysosome-dependent p300 degradation and the loss of p300 protein may reflect Garcinol's mechanism of action. Garcinol by reducing p300 protein levels enhances the in vivo activity of 7.16.4 in the inhibition of tumor growth, in which T reg plays a negative role (Fig. 6B). We are encouraged by this study and have started to design p300 inhibitors that are more specific for p300?FOXP3 interaction, an approach that can circumvent the non-specific toxicity of Garcinol due to multiple functions of p300 (Chen and Li, 2011) and the broad effects of Garcinol on many types of targets (Ahmad et al., 2012; Padhye et al., 2009; Saadat and Gupta, 2012). Conclusions. Garcinol induces p300 degradation via the lysosome pathway. Since p300 is involved in the regulation of FOXP3, Garcinol treatment leads to FOXP3 hypoacetylation and degradation. Garcinol treatment is associated with reduced Treg suppressive activity and helps improve the anti-tumor activity of targeted antibody therapy to p185 her2/neu. In summary, Garcinol as an inhibitor for p300 has provided a unique tool to understand how p300 regulate FOXP3 acetylation and stability. This knowledge may lead to new strategies to develop therapeutic agents for cancers and other diseases that T reg cells are involved in. Supplementary Material. Supplemental info. Acknowledgments.

                "text": "Tumor-Associated Mutant p53 Drives the Warburg Effect\tTumor cells primarily utilize aerobic glycolysis for energy production, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. Its mechanism is not well-understood. The tumor suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in tumors. Many tumor-associated mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins not only lose tumor suppressive function, but also gain new oncogenic functions that are independent of wild type p53, defined as mutp53 gain-of-function (GOF). Here we show that tumor-associated mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect in cultured cells and mutp53 knock-in mice as a new mutp53 GOF. Mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect through promoting GLUT1 translocation to plasma membrane, which is mediated by the activated RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK. Inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK/GLUT1 signaling largely abolishes mutp53 GOF in stimulating the Warburg effect. Furthermore, inhibition of glycolysis in tumor cells greatly compromises mutp53 GOF in promoting tumorigenesis. Thus, our results reveal a new mutp53 GOF and a mechanism for controlling the Warburg effect. Introduction. Tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in tumor prevention 1?3. p53 is the most frequently-mutated gene in human tumors. Majority of p53 mutations, including several \u00a1\u00b0mutational hotspots\u00a1\u00b1 in tumors (e.g. R175H, R248Q, and R273H), are missense mutations, which usually result in the expression of full-length mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins in tumor cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that many tumor-associated mutp53 proteins, particularly these several \u00a1\u00b0tumor hotspot mutants\u00a1\u00b1, not only lose tumor suppressive functions of wild type p53 (wtp53), but also gain new oncogenic functions that are independent of wtp53, including promoting cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis and metastasis, which are defined as mutp53 gain-of-function (GOF) 4?7. The mutp53 GOF is clearly demonstrated by mutp53 knock-in mouse models; mice that express R172H or R270H mutp53 (equivalent to human R175H and R273H, respectively) develop an altered spectrum of tumors and more metastatic tumors compared with p53?/? mice 8, 9. The mechanism of mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis is not well-understood. Recent studies have shown that metabolic changes are a hallmark of tumor cells and a key contributor to tumor development 10?13. The Warburg effect (or aerobic glycolysis) is the best characterized metabolic change in tumor cells. Most tumor cells primarily utilize glycolysis for their energy needs even under normal oxygen concentrations, a phenomenon termed \u00a1\u00b0the Warburg effect\u00a1\u00b1 14. The Warburg effect is characterized by a much higher rate of glucose uptake and higher lactate production in tumor cells compared with normal cells 10, 12?14. The Warburg effect provides a rational for Positron Emission Tomography imaging developed for tumor detection since tumors take up more of the glucose analog 18flurodeoxyglucose than normal tissues. Emerging evidence has indicated that the Warburg effect contributes greatly to tumorigenesis and could be targeted for tumor therapy 12, 15, 16. However, the mechanism for the Warburg effect is not well-understood. As a transcription factor, wtp53 mainly exerts its function in tumor suppression through transcriptional regulation of its target genes to initiate various cellular responses, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis 1?3. Recent studies have shown that regulating energy metabolism is a critical function of wtp53 in tumor suppression 12, 13, 17, 18. Wtp53 represses glycolysis and the Warburg effect through transcriptional regulation of genes involved in energy metabolism, including SCO2, TIGAR, GLS2 and Parkin 19?22. Loss of wtp53 leads to the Warburg effect in cultured cells and mice. It remains unknown whether mutp53 can stimulate the Warburg effect as a novel GOF. In this study, we find that tumor-associated mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect both in cultured cells and mutp53 knock-in mice. This effect is mainly through promoting the translocation of GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1) to plasma membrane, which is mediated by an activated RhoA/ROCK signaling. Inhibition of glycolysis and the Warburg effect in tumor cells greatly attenuates mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis. Our results demonstrate a new mutp53 GOF, and also reveal a mechanism for the Warburg effect in cancer cells. Results. Mutp53 stimulates the Warburg Effect in vitro and in vivo. The Warburg effect is characterized by greatly increased glucose uptake and lactate production in tumor cells 12, 14. To investigate the effect of mutp53 on the Warburg effect, p53-null human lung carcinoma H1299 cells were stably transduced with retroviral vectors expressing \u00a1\u00b0tumor hotspot mutants\u00a1\u00b1 R175H, R248Q and R273H mutp53, respectively, and the levels of glucose uptake, glycolytic rate and lactate production in cells were measured. Expression of R175H, R248Q and R273H mutp53 in H1299 cells greatly stimulated the Warburg effect; much higher levels of glucose uptake, glycolytic rate and lactate production were observed in cells with mutp53 expression compared with control cells (Fig. 1a). A similar effect was observed for endogenous mutp53; in human breast SK-BR3 and MDA-MB468 cells which express R175H and R273H mutp53, respectively, knockdown of endogenous mutp53 by shRNA vectors greatly reduced glucose uptake, glycolytic rate and lactate production (Fig. 1b). This stimulating effect of mutp53 on the Warburg effect was also observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from p53 R172H/R172H knock-in mice (equivalent to human R175H). Compared with p53?/? MEFs, p53 R172H/R172H MEFs showed clearly enhanced glucose uptake, glycolytic rate and lactate production (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, the enhanced glucose uptake was observed in different tissues in p53 R172H/R172H mice compared with p53?/? mice, including the liver, lung and small intestine (Fig. 1d). It is well-established that the serum lactate level indicates glycolytic status in mice 23, 24. p53 R172H/R172H mice showed much higher levels of serum lactate than p53?/? mice (Fig. 1e), indicating a higher glycolytic rate in p53 R172H/R172H mice. Recently, wtp53 was reported to repress the Warburg effect 19?21. To further confirm that this stimulating effect of mutp53 on the Warburg effect is a novel mutp53 GOF and is independent of the function of wtp53, we examined whether wtp53 exhibits an inhibitory effect on the Warburg effect as reported using our systems. As shown in Fig. 2a, p53+/+ MEFs displayed much lower levels of glucose uptake, glycolytic rate and lactate production than p53?/? MEFs. Consistently, compared with p53?/? mice, p53+/+ mice displayed a much lower level of glucose uptake in different tissues (Fig. 2b), and a clear lower level of serum lactate (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous wtp53 by shRNA vectors in human breast MCF7, lung H460 and A549 cells clearly promoted the glucose uptake, glycolytic rate and lactate production compared with control cells transduced with control shRNA vectors (Fig. 2d). These results clearly show that wtp53 can repress the Warburg effect in vitro and in vivo, which is consistent with previous reports 19?21. Thus, our results clearly demonstrate that stimulating the Warburg effect is a novel mutp53 GOF, which is independent of wtp53\u00a1\u00afs function. Mutp53 promotes GLUT1 translocation. Transport of glucose across the plasma membrane (PM) of cells is the first rate-limiting step for glucose metabolism, which is mediated by glucose transporters (GLUTs), including GLUT1-4. GLUT4 is the main glucose transporter expressed in insulin-responsive fat and muscle tissues. Insulin dramatically stimulates the translocation of GLUT4 to the PM to promote the glucose uptake in fat and muscle. GLUT1-3 are responsible for the basal glucose uptake in cells and tissues 25. Among them, GLUT1 is widely expressed in almost all types of cells and tissues and responsible for their basal glucose uptake, whereas GLUT2 and 3 are responsible for the basal glucose uptake in some specific tissues 25. While the dysregulation of GLUT4 signaling is an important cause for type 2 diabetes, dysregulation of GLUT1-3 signaling, especially GLUT1, contributes to tumorigenesis. For example, GLUT1 is frequently overexpressed in tumors, which contributes to the Warburg effect 26, 27. Indeed, ectopic expression of GLUT1 by expression vectors in H1299 and p53?/? MEF cells greatly enhanced glucose uptake, glycolytic rate and lactate production in cells (Supplementary Fig. S1a?d). It has been well-established that increased translocation of GLUT1 from the intracellular pool to the PM promotes glucose transport 25, 28. Interestingly, mutp53 promoted GLUT1 translocation to the PM in cells. Ectopic expression of mutp53 greatly increased GLUT1 levels on the PM but did not change the total GLUT1 levels in H1299 cells as measured by Western-blot assays using isolated PM fractions (Fig. 3a). To confirm this result, cells were transduced with pLPCX-Myc-GLUT1 vectors expressing GLUT1 with Myc tag in its first exofacial loop, and the levels of Myc-GLUT1 on the cell surface or in the whole cell were measured by immunofluoroscence (IF) staining with an anti-Myc antiboy followed by flow cytometry analysis. Mutp53 clearly increased the levels of Myc-GLUT1 protein on the PM but did not affect the total Myc-GLUT1 levels in H1299 cells (Fig. 3b). Similar results were observed by IF staining of cells transduced with pLPCX-Myc-GLUT1 vectors; mutp53 expression in H1299 clearly promoted the translocation of Myc-GLUT1 protein from cytoplasm to the cell surface (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous mutp53 in SK-BR3 and MDA-MB468 cells clearly reduced the levels of endogenous GLUT1 on the PM but not the total GLUT1 levels in the cells as analyzed by Western-blot assays (Fig. 3d), and reduced the levels of exogenous Myc-GLUT1 on the PM but not the total Myc-GLUT1 levels in the cells as analyzed by IF assays in a flow cytometry (Fig. 3e). IF staining showed that mutp53 knockdown in both cell lines clearly decreased Myc-GLUT1 distribution on cell surface and increased its distribution in cytoplasm (Fig. 3f). Consistent results were observed in p53 R172H/R172H MEF cells; R172H mutp53 clearly promoted the translocation of GLUT1 of both endogenous GLUT1 and Myc-GLUT1 in MEF cells (Fig. 3g & h). Similar results were observed in p53 R172H/R172H mice; compared with p53?/? mice, mutp53 clearly increased GLUT1 levels on the PM but not the total GLUT1 levels in different tissues from p53 R172H/R172H mice, including the liver (Fig. 3i), lung and small intestine tissues (Supplementary Fig. S2). Interestingly, mutp53 did not affect the translocation of GLUT2 or GLUT3, the other two glucose transporters that regulate the basal glucose uptake in certain types of tissues and cells. Expression of R175H, R248Q or R273H mutp53 in H1299 cells or R172H mutp53 in p53 R172H/R172H MEFs did not affect the levels of endogenous GLUT2/3 or Myc-GLUT2/3 on the PM or in the whole cell compared with control H1299 cells and p53?/? MEFs cells, respectively (Fig. 3j & k). The expression of GLUT4 and its translocation to the PM were also examined in H1299 and p53 R172H/R172H MEF cells. The levels of GLUT4 were too low to be detected in these two cell lines (Fig. 3j), indicating that GLUT4 is not a major contributor to the role of mutp53 in stimulating the Warburg effect in these cells. To test whether the enhanced GLUT1 translocation mediates the stimulating effect of mutp53 on the Warburg effect, endogenous GLUT1 was knocked down by shRNA in cells. While GLUT1 overexpression promotes the Warburg effect (Supplementary Fig. S1), GLUT1 knockdown clearly reduced the glucose uptake, glycolytic rate and lactate production in H1299 and MEF cells (Fig. 4a & b). Notably, GLUT1 knockdown largely abolished the stimulating effect of mutp53 on the Warburg effect in H1299 cells and in p53 R172H/R172H MEF cells (Fig. 4a & b). In SK-BR3 and MDA-MB468 cells, GLUT1 knockdown clearly reduced the Warburg effect, similar to the effect of mutp53 knockdown (Fig. 4c). However, simultaneous knockdown of mutp53 and GLUT1 in these two cell lines did not produce additive inhibitory effect on the Warburg effect (Fig. 4c), further suggesting that GLUT1 mediates the stimulating effect of mutp53 on the Warburg effect in cells. Similar to the effect of GLUT1 knockdown on the Warburg effect, knockdown of endogenous GLUT3 by shRNA vectors in H1299 and MEFs greatly reduced glucose uptake, glycolytic rate and lactate production to similar levels as that resulted from GLUT1 knockdown (Fig. 4d & e). However, GLUT3 knockdown did not clearly affect the promoting effect of mutp53 on the Warburg effect, which was still clearly observed in both cell lines with lower glycolytic rates caused by GLUT3 knockdown (Fig. 4d & e). Similarly, knockdown of GLUT2 clearly reduced the Warburg effect in p53 R172H/R172H MEFs, but did not clearly affect the promoting effect of mutp53 on the Warburg effect (Fig. 4e). These results strongly suggest that the promoting effect of mutp53 on the Warburg effect is mediated by GLUT1. Taken together, these results indicate that mutp53 can specifically promote GLUT1 translocation to the PM, which is an important mechanism for mutp53 to stimulate the Warburg effect in tumor cells. Mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect through RhoA activation. Small GTPase proteins, such as Rab and Rho families, were reported to be involved in the regulation of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the PM and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in fat and muscle, two insulin responsive tissues 25, 29. RhoA is a small GTPase that belongs to the Rho family. RhoA is frequently overexpressed or activated in tumors and contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells 30, 31. RhoA is also involved in stimulating GLUT4 translocation to the PM in response to insulin stimulation in fat and muscle cells 32, 33. Interestingly, mutp53 was recently reported to activate RhoA through its up-regulation of the expression of positive regulators for RhoA, including RhoGDI and Rho GEF-H1 34?37. These findings raised a possibility that mutp53 may promote GLUT1 translocation and stimulate the Warburg effect through its activation of RhoA in tumor cells. However, the translocation regulation of GLUT1 and GLUT4 in cells is quite different, which is highly cell-type specific 25, 32. For example, the translocation of GLUT4 is dramatically stimulated by insulin, whereas GLUT1 translocation is not markedly regulated by insulin 25, 32. Currently, it is unclear whether RhoA can regulate GLUT1 translocation to affect the basal glucose uptake, and whether RhoA activation can promote the Warburg effect in cancer cells. We first tested whether mutp53 activates RhoA in the cells we used for this study. RhoA cycles between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states in cells 31, 38. As shown in Fig. 5a, expression of mutp53 greatly increased the levels of RhoA-GTP but not the total RhoA in H1299 and p53 R172H/R172H MEF cells, and furthermore, knockdown of endogenous mutp53 greatly reduced the levels of RhoA-GTP but not the total RhoA in MDA-MB468 and SK-BR3 cells. We further investigated whether RhoA activation promotes GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect, and whether RhoA activation mediates mutp53\u00a1\u00afs GOF in stimulating the Warburg effect in cancer cells. Ectopic expression of RhoA by vectors in H1299 and p53?/? MEF cells greatly promoted the translocation of GLUT1 (Fig. 5b) to the PM, and furthermore, greatly stimulated the Warburg effect (Fig. 5c). Consistently, RhoA knockdown by shRNA vectors or siRNA oligos clearly reduced the translocation of endogenous GLUT1 (Fig. 5d) and Myc-GLUT1 to the PM (Fig. 5e?g), and reduced the Warburg effect (Fig. 5h?j) in H1299, MDA-MB468 and p53 R172H/R172H MEF cells. Importantly, RhoA knockdown largely abolished the promoting effects of mutp53 on GLUT1 translocation to the PM (Fig. 5d?g) and the Warburg effect (Fig. 5h?j) in these cells. Similar results were observed in SK-BR3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3a?c). Interestingly, consistent with the effect of mutp53 on GLUT2 and 3, RhoA did not show clear effect on the translocation of GLUT2 or 3 to the PM (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results together clearly demonstrate a novel function of RhoA in tumorigenesis; RhoA activation promotes GLUT1 translocation to the PM, and therefore, promotes the Warburg effect in cancer cells, which is an important mechanism for mutp53 to stimulate the Warburg effect in cancer cells. ROCK mediates the effect of mutp53. RhoA has been reported to regulate many proteins and different signaling pathways. Among them, ROCK (Rho-associated protein kinase) is a direct downstream effector kinase of RhoA. ROCK has two isoforms, ROCK1 and ROCK2 (ROCK1/2) 30, 38. ROCK has been reported to regulate insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in fat and muscle tissues 39?41. However, since the translocation regulation of GLUT1 and GLUT4 in cells is quite different and highly cell-type specific 25, 32, it is unclear whether ROCK activation can promote GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect in cancer cells. We investigated whether ROCK mediates mutp53 GOF in stimulating the Warburg effect. MYPT1 (myosin phosphatase target subunit 1) and MLC2 (myosin light chain 2) are two well-known downstream targets of ROCK, which can be phosphorylated by ROCK at Thr696 and Ser19, respectively 30, 38. First, we examined whether mutp53 enhances the activities of ROCK1/2 in cells by measuring the levels of phosphorylation at Thr696 of MYPT1 using enzyme immunoassays. Expression of mutp53 enhanced ROCK1/2 activities in H1299 and MEF cells, whereas knockdown of mutp53 reduced the ROCK1/2 activities in SK-BR3 and MDA-MB468 cells (Fig. 6a). This result was confirmed by Western-blot assays showing that mutp53 expression clearly increased the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr696 and MLC2 at Ser19 in H1299 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5a), whereas knockdown of endogenous mutp53 clearly reduced phosphorylation in MDA-MB468 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5b). This effect of mutp53 was largely abolished when RhoA or ROCK1/2 was knocked down by shRNA vectors or siRNA oligos (Supplementary Fig. S5a?d), indicating the mutp53 regulates the phosphorylation of MYPT1 and MLC2 through activation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling. We further tested whether ROCK activation promotes GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect in cancer cells, and whether ROCK activation mediates mutp53\u00a1\u00afs role in stimulating GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect. Y27632, a widely-used inhibitor for ROCK1/2 30, 38, 42, was employed to block ROCK1/2 activities in cells. Y27632 clearly reduced ROCK activities represented by the reduced phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr696 and MLC2 at Ser19 as measured by enzyme immunoassays and Western-blot assays (Supplementary Fig. S5e & f). Furthermore, Y27632 largely abolished the promoting effect of mutp53 on ROCK activities in cells (Supplementary Fig. S5e & f). Notably, Y27632 greatly reduced the translocation of GLUT1 to the PM (Fig. 6b & c ), and the Warburg effect in H1299 cells (Fig. 6d). Consistent results were observed in p53 R172H/R172H MEF cells (Fig. 6b, e & f). Importantly, Y27632 largely abolished the promoting effects of mutp53 on the translocation of GLUT1 to the PM (Fig. 6b, c & e), and the Warburg effect in these cells (Fig. 6d & f). Consistent results were observed in both SK-BR3 and MDA-MB468 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). To further confirm that the role of ROCK in mediating the mutp53\u00a1\u00afs effect on GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect, the endogenous ROCK1/2 were knocked down by siRNA oligos. Consistent with the results of Y27632 treatments, knockdown of ROCK1/2 greatly reduced the GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect in cells, and furthermore, largely abolished the stimulating effects of mutp53 on GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect in H1299 (Fig. 6c & d), p53 R172H/R172H MEF (Fig. 6e & f) and MDA-MB468 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6c & e). These results clearly show that as a downstream effector of RhoA, ROCK mediates mutp53\u00a1\u00afs role in stimulating GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect in cancer cells. The PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways, two pathways that are frequently activated in cancer, were reported to promote glucose uptake in cells 43?45. To investigate whether these two pathways contribute to the promoting effects of mutp53 on the Warburg effect, we first examined whether mutp53 can activate these two pathways in these cell lines that we employed for this study by measuring the levels of phosphorylation of AKT at Thr473 and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at Thr202/Tyr204, respectively. Mutp53 slightly increased the AKT activity in H1299 cells, which is consistent with a previous report 5, but not in MDM-MB468 or MEF cells, suggesting that the activation of AKT by mutp53 is cell type- and context-dependent (Supplementary Fig. S7a) 46. Mutp53 showed no clear effect on the ERK signaling in these cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S7b). To further test whether blocking the AKT and ERK signaling pathways affect the role of mutp53 in the Warburg effect, H1299 cells with or without mutp53 expression were treated with PI3K/AKT inhibitors, Wortmannin and LY294002 43, 45, or ERK inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059 44, and their impacts upon mutp53\u00a1\u00afs effect on glucose uptake were examined. All these treatments greatly reduced the glucose uptake in H1299 cells. However, these treatments did not clearly affect the promoting effects of mutp53 on glucose uptake (Supplementary Fig. S7c & d). These results strongly suggested that the PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathways did not contribute significantly to the promoting effect of mutp53 on the Warburg effect in these cells. Insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) signaling plays an important role in the regulation of the translocation of glucose transporters and glucose uptake in insulin-responsive muscle and fat tissues 25. Activated IGF-1/IGF-1 receptor signaling also plays an important role in cancer 47. To investigate whether the activated insulin/IGF-1 signaling contributes to the effect of mutp53 on the GLUT1 translocation, H1299 cells were treated with insulin and IGF-1, respectively, to activate the insulin/IGF-1 signaling. Both insulin and IGF-1 moderately induced the GLUT1 protein expression (by ~2-fold at 8 h after treatments), and furthermore, slightly promoted GLUT1 translocation to the PM (by ~20?30% at 10 min, 4 and 8 h after treatments) in H1299 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8). However, these effects were not mutp53-specific since similar effects were observed in both H1299 cells with our without mutp53 expression. Furthermore, the effect of insulin and IGF-1 on GLUT1 translocation was much weaker compared with the effect of mutp53. These results suggested that activated insulin/IGF-1 signaling did not contribute significantly to the effect of mutp53 on GLUT1 translocation in H1299 cells. Mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect via RhoA/ROCK in vivo. We further investigated whether mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect through the activation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling in vivo as what we observed in cultured cells. Indeed, the stimulating effect of mutp53 on the activities of RhoA and ROCK were also observed in p53 R172H/R172H mice. Compared with p53?/? mice, much higher levels of RhoA-GTP (Fig. 6g) and ROCK activities (Fig. 6h; Supplementary Fig. S9) were observed in different tissues of p53 R172H/R172H mice, including the liver, lung and small intestine. Treating mice with Y27632 (i.p. injection) clearly reduced the GLUT1 translocation to the PM (Fig. 6i) and glucose uptake (Fig. 6j) in different tissues, and serum lactate levels (Fig. 6k). Importantly, Y27632 largely abolished mutp53\u00a1\u00afs effects on ROCK activation (Supplementary Fig. S9), GLUT1 translocation (Fig. 6i), glucose uptake (Fig. 6j), and serum lactate levels (Fig. 6k). These results clearly show that the activated RhoA/ROCK signaling mediates the promoting effect of mutp53 on GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect in vivo. Mutp53 enhances actin polymerization. Rho family proteins, including RhoA, induce actin polymerization and play an important role in vesicular trafficking, which is critical for the translocation of glucose transporters 29, 48, 49. Actin polymerization, the assembly of actin monomers into filaments (polymeric actin or F-actin), plays a critical role in vesicular trafficking 29, 48, 49. ROCK has been reported to regulate insulin-stimulated GLU4 translocation and glucose uptake in fat and muscle through the regulation of actin polymerization 39. Interestingly, we found that mutp53 promoted actin polymerization. Expression of mutp53 clearly increased the levels of polymeric actin but not total actin in H1299 cells (Fig. 7a). This effect of mutp53 on actin polymerization can be largely abolished by inhibition of RhoA/ROCK signaling, including RhoA knockdown and Y27632 treatments (Fig. 7a). Cytochalasin D and latrunculin B, two widely-used actin polymerization inhibitors 50, 51, which abolished the promoting effect of mutp53 on actin polymerization (Fig. 7b), also largely abolished the stimulating effects of mutp53 on the translocation of endogenous GLUT1 (Fig. 7c) and Myc-GLUT1 (Fig. 7d) to the PM in H1299 cells. Most importantly, cytochalasin D and latrunculin B largely abolished the stimulating effects of mutp53 on the Warburg effect in H1299 cells (Fig.7e). These results were confirmed in p53 R172H/R172H MEF (Fig. 7f?h) and MDA-MB468 cells (Fig. 7i?k). These results strongly suggest that mutp53 can enhance actin polymerization through activating RhoA/ROCK signaling, which is one of the mechanisms that leads to the enhanced GLUT1 translocation to the PM and the Warburg effect in cancer cells. Mutp53 GOF in the Warburg effect promotes tumorigenesis. The Warburg effect has been recently demonstrated as a key contributor to tumor progression, and reversing the Warburg effect greatly compromised tumorigenecity of tumor cells 12, 15, 16 . We investigated whether stimulating the Warburg effect is an important mechanism contributing to mutp53\u00a1\u00afs role in tumorigenesis. Consistent with the reported GOF of mutp53 in tumorigenesis 4?7, mutp53 promoted tumorigenesis in H1299 and MDA-MB468 cells. Expression of R175H, R248Q, or R273H mutp53 in H1299 cells clearly promoted the anchorage-independent growth of the cells on soft agar (Fig. 8a), whereas knockdown of endogenous R273H mutp53 in MDA-MB468 cells clearly reduced the anchorage-independent growth of the cells (Fig. 8b). Furthermore, expression of mutp53 in H1299 cells clearly promoted the growth of xenograft tumors formed by H1299 cells in nude mice (Fig. 8c?e), whereas knockdown of endogenous R273H mutp53 in MDA-MB468 cells clearly reduced the growth of xenograft tumors formed by MDA-MB468 cells (Fig. 8f). Notably, knockdown of GLUT1 or RhoA by shRNA largely abolished the promoting effects of mutp53 on both anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 8a & b) and xenograft tumor growth (Fig. 8c?f) in H1299 and MDA-MB468 cells. To further test this hypothesis, cells were cultured in media containing galactose instead of glucose to inhibit glycolysis 52, 53 for anchorage-independent growth assays. Galactose enters glycolysis through the Leloir pathway, which occurs at a much lower rate than glucose entry into glycolysis. Consistent with previous reports 53, galactose greatly reduced the anchorage-independent growth in H1299 (Fig. 8g) and MDA-MB468 cells (Fig. 8h). Notably, galactose largely abolished the promoting effect of mutp53 on the anchorage-independent growth in H1299 cells (Fig. 8g) and MDA-MB468 cells (Fig. 8h). Taken together, these results clearly show that inhibition of the Warburg effect or glycolysis greatly compromised mutp53 GOF in promoting tumorigenesis, and strongly suggest that mutp53 GOF in stimulating the Warburg effect promotes tumorigenesis. Discussion. Recent studies have demonstrated that many tumor-associated mutp53 proteins gain new oncogenic functions to promote tumor cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, metastasis and lipid metabolism 4?7 . However, the mechanism of mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis is not well-understood. Results from this study clearly demonstrate a novel GOF of mutp53 in both cultured cells and mutp53 knock-in mice, i.e. mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect. This function of mutp53 is contrary to the function of wtp53 in repressing the Warburg effect, which was confirmed by our results in this study (Fig. 1&2). Mutp53 does not affect the expression of GLUT1, but promotes GLUT1 translocation to the PM. GLUT1 knockdown largely abolishes this stimulating effect of mutp53 on the Warburg effect in cells. Furthermore, mutp53 does not affect the expression or the PM translocation of GLUT2 or GLUT3. Knockdown of GLUT2 or GLUT3 clearly reduced the Warburg effect in cells, but did not clearly affect the stimulating effect of mutp53 on the Warburg effect. Currently, the mechanism by which mutp53 specifically regulates the translocation of GLUT1 in tumor cells remains unclear. These results strongly suggest that promoting the GLUT1 translocation to the PM is an important mechanism by which mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect. GLUTs, including GLUT1-4, mediate the transport of glucose across the PM, a critical step for glucose metabolism. Each of these GLUTs displays distinct expression patterns in cells and tissues. For example, GLUT4 is specifically and highly expressed in fat and muscle tissues, and is responsive to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in these two tissues. In contrast, GLUT1 is ubiquitously expressed and responsible for the basal glucose uptake in various types of cells. The regulation of GLUTs translocation is different among GLUTs, and the mechanisms appear to be highly cell type- and context-dependent 25, 32. For example, while translocation of GLUT4 is dramatically stimulated by insulin in fat and muscle cells, the translocation of GLUT1 is not markedly regulated by insulin 25, 32. It has been reported that the RhoA/ROCK signaling is involved in the regulation of the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 and glucose uptake 25, 32, 33, 40. However, it is unclear whether RhoA/ROCK signaling can regulate GLUT1 translocation and the basal glucose uptake in cells, especially in cells other than fat and muscle. Furthermore, it is unclear whether RhoA/ROCK activation in cancer cells promotes the Warburg effect in cancer cells. Results from this study clearly show that RhoA/ROCK can promote the translocation of GLUT1 to the PM and promote the basal glucose uptake in various cells. Furthermore, the activation of RhoA/ROCK signaling by mutp53 mediates mutp53\u00a1\u00afs role in promoting GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect in cancer cells. Inhibition of RhoA/ROCK signaling by knocking down RhoA or ROCK1/2, or by the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 all largely abolishes the stimulating effect of mutp53 on the GLUT1 translocation to the PM and the Warburg effect in cells. Thus, our results reveal that promoting the GLUT1 translocation to the PM to stimulate the Warburg effect in cancer cells is a novel mechanism by which the activated RhoA/ROCK signaling promotes tumorigenesis, especially in cells containing mutp53. The RhoA signaling is frequently activated in many types of cancer, which plays a critical role in promoting tumor cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis 30, 31. In addition to our finding that mutp53 promotes the Warburg effect through RhoA activation, recent studies also showed that the activation of RhoA by mutp53 contributes to the GOF of mutp53 in tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis 34?37. These findings together indicate an important role of the RhoA signaling in mediating mutp53 GOF in cancer. However, it is still not well-understood how mutp53 activates RhoA. As a small GTPase, RhoA activity is regulated by many positive and negative regulators, especially a group of Rho GEFs, Rho GAPs, and Rho GDIs. Recently, it was reported that mutp53 activates RhoA through transcriptional up-regulation of RhoGDI and Rho GEF-H1, two positive regulators for RhoA 34?36. It will be of interest to examine whether mutp53 can regulate the expression of some other RhoA regulators to activate RhoA, including up-regulation of additional positive regulators and/or down-regulation of some negative regulators for RhoA. In addition to the transcription regulation, mutp53 can interact with other proteins to affect their functions, which contributes to the GOF of mutp53 in cancer 6, 54. It is possible that mutp53 interacts with some upstream regulators for RhoA to activate RhoA. Considering the important role of mutp53/RhoA signaling in tumorigenesis and potential therapeutic applications, future studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which mutp53 activates RhoA. In summary, our results clearly demonstrate that stimulating the Warburg effect in tumor cells is a novel GOF of tumor-associated mutp53. Our results also reveal that mutp53 acts as an important mediator for the Warburg effect in cancer cells, which provides a new mechanism for the Warburg effect. Emerging evidence has strongly suggested that as a hallmark of tumor cells, metabolic changes in tumors, such as the Warburg effect, could be targeted for tumor therapy. Our results strongly suggest that targeting altered glucose metabolism could be a feasible therapeutic strategy for tumor carrying mutp53. Methods. Cells and vectors. H1299, SK-BR3, MDA-MB468, H460, MCF-7, and A549 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The p53-null human lung H1299 cells were transduced with pLPCX-mutp53 retroviral vectors expressing R175H, R248Q and R273H mutp53, respectively, to establish cells with stable ectopic expression of mutp53. Human breast SK-BR3 cells expressing R175H mutp53 and MDA-MB468 cells expressing R273H mutp53 were transduced with shRNA vectors against p53 to establish cells with stable knockdown of endogenous mutp53 21. pBABE-p53shRNA retroviral shRNA vectors against p53 was a generous gift from Dr. R. Agami (The Netherlands Cancer Institute). The lentiviral shRNA vector against p53 (TRCN0000003755) were purchased from Sigma. Control cells were transduced with empty vectors. p53?/? and p53 R172H/R172H MEF cells were established following the published method 55. RhoA expression vector pLPCX-Flag-RhoA was constructed by using Flag-RhoA DNA fragment from pCMV5-Flag-RhoA (Addgene). Lentiviral shRNA vectors against human GLUT1 (V3LHS_321625 and V3LHS_321626), human GLUT3 (V3LHS_323130 and V3LHS_323134) and human RhoA (V3LHS_646048 and V3LHS_642222) were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). siRNA oligos against ROCK1 (for human: HSC.RNAI.N005406.12.1, and HSC.RNAI.N005406.12.2; for mouse: MMC.RNAI.N009071.12.1, and MMC.RNAI.N009071.12.3), ROCK2 (for human: HSC.RNAI.N004850.12.1, and HSC.RNAI.N004850.12.2; for mouse: MMC.RNAI.N009072.12.1, and MMC.RNAI.N009072.12.4), mouse GLUT1 (MMC.RNAI.N011400.12.4, and MMC.RNAI.N011400.12.5), mouse GLUT3 (MMC.RNAI.N011401.12.2, and MMC.RNAI.N011401.12.4) were purchased form Integrated DNA Technologies. siRNA oligos against mouse GLUT2 (5\u00a1\u00af-AAGUUGGAAGAGGAAGUCATT-3\u00a1\u00af, and 5\u00a1\u00af-CGGAAAGCUGCCAUUAACUTT-3\u00a1\u00af) were synthesized by Sigma. To avoid off-target effects, two different shRNA vectors or siRNA oligos against each gene were employed. For treatment of ROCK inhibitor Y27632, cells were treated with Y27632 (5, 10, and 20 \u00a5\u00ecM; stock solution was prepared in H 2O) for 6 h before assays. For treatments of AKT inhibitors, cells were treated with Wortmannin (0.5, 1, and 2 \u00a5\u00ecM) or LY249002 (10, 20, 30 \u00a5\u00ecM) for 3 h before assays. For treatments of ERK inhibitors, cells were treated with U0126 (0.5, 1 and 2 \u00a5\u00ecM) or PD98059 (5, 10 and 20 \u00a5\u00ecM) for 2 h before assays. For treatments of IGF-1 and insulin, cells were serum starved for 12 h before they were treated with IGF-1 (50 and 100 ng/ml) or insulin (50 and 100 nM) for 10 min, 4 h and 8 h before assays. In vivo glucose uptake assays and serum lactate measurements. Assays for glucose uptake in mouse tissues were performed as described 56, 57. Briefly, five-week-old male p53+/+, p53?/? and p53 R172H/R172H C57BL6/J mice 8 (generous gifts from Dr. Gigi Lozano) were injected (i.p.) with 3H-2-deoxyglucose (1 \u00a5\u00ecci/g body weight) and tissues were collected at 1.5 h after injection to measure the levels of 3H-2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate accumulated in tissues. To study the effect of ROCK inhibitor Y27632 on glucose uptake of tissues, mice were injected (i.p.) with Y27632 (10 \u00a5\u00ecg/g body weight) or PBS at 3 h before injection (i.p.) of 3H-2-deoxyglucose. The lactate levels in serum were determined by using a lactate Assay Kit according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instruction (Biovision). All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rutgers University. Measurements of glucose uptake in cells. Glucose uptake was measured by measuring the uptake of 3H-2-deoxyglucose by cells 21, 58. Briefly, cells cultured in 12-well plates were pre-incubated in glucose-free media for 30 min. 3H-2-deoxyglucose (1 \u00a5\u00ecCi/well) was then added to the cells and incubated for 30 min before cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 1% SDS. The radioactivity of cell lysates was determined in a liquid scintillation counter and normalized to the protein concentrations of cell lysates. Measurements of glycolytic rates in cells. The glycolytic rate was measured by monitoring the conversion of 5- 3H-glucose to 3H-H 2O 19, 21. Briefly, cells (1\u00a1\u00bf10 6) were washed in PBS and then resuspended in 1 mL of Krebs buffer without glucose for 30 min at 37 \u00a1\u00c6C. Cells were then resuspended in 0.5 mL of Krebs buffer containing 10 mM glucose and 5 \u00a5\u00ecCi of 5-[ 3H]glucose for 1 h. Triplicate 100 \u00a5\u00ecL aliquots were transferred to uncapped PCR tubes containing 100 \u00a5\u00ecL of 0.2 N HCl, and a tube was transferred to a scintillation vial containing 0.5 mL of H 2O. The scintillation vials were sealed and left for 48 h to allow diffusion to occur. The amounts of diffused and undiffused 3H were determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Measurements of lactate production in cells. Cells were cultured in fresh phenol red-free media and incubated for 12?24 h before the culture media were collected. The lactate levels were determined by using lactate Assay Kits according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instruction (Biovision), and normalized with cell number 21. Western-blot Assays. Standard Western blot assays and following antibodies were used to analyze protein expression. GLUT1 (Abcam; 1:4000); GLUT2 (Abcam; 1:2000); GLUT3(Abcam; 1:2000); GLUT4 (Santa Cruz; 1:2000); RhoA (Millipore; 1:2000); p53 (Santa Cruz; 1:1000); \u00a5\u00e2-actin (Sigma; 1:20,000); Na +/K + ATPase (Novus; 1:3000); Calnexin (Abcam; 1:5000); Flag (Sigma; 1:10,000); Myc (Roche; 1:1000); p-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling; 1:1000); AKT (Santa Cruz; 1:4000); p-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling; 1:2000); ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling; 1:2000); p-MYPT1 (Thr696) (EMD Millipore; 1:2000); MYPT1 (Cell Signaling; 1:2000); p-MLC2 (Ser19) (Cell Signaling; 1:1000); MLC2 (Cell Signaling; 1:2000). Quantitative Real-Time PCR Assays. Total RNA was prepared with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was prepared using a TaqMan reverse transcription kit, and real-time PCR was performed with TaqMan PCR mixture (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to standard protocols 21. The Taqman primers for human ROCK1 (Hs01127699_m1), human ROCK2 (Hs00178154_m1), human actin (Hs99999903_m1), mouse ROCK1 (Mm00485745_m1), mouse ROCK2 (Mm01270843_m1) and mouse actin (Mm01205647_g1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The expression of ROCK1 and ROCK2 in cells was normalized to the expression of actin gene. Assays for RhoA and ROCK activities. For RhoA activity analysis, GST-Rhotekin Rho binding domain (RBD) pull-down assays were performed with Rho activity kits (Millipore) to measure the levels of GTP-bound RhoA (RhoA-GTP) in cells 59. The RBD of the Rho effector protein Rhotekin binds specifically to the RhoA-GTP. The levels of precipitated RhoA-GTP were measured by Western-blot assays using a RhoA antibody, and normalized to total RhoA levels in cells. The ROCK activity was measured by enzyme immunoassays using ROCK activity assay kits (Millipore). In brief, ROCK1 and ROCK2 (ROCK1/2) were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and added to 96-well plates pre-coated with recombinant MYPT1, which contains a Thr696 residue that can be phosphorylated by ROCK1/2 59. The levels of MYPT1 phosphorylation on Thr696, which represent the ROCK1/2 activities, were detected with a phospho-MYPT1-Thr696 antibody (1:1000) and an HRP-conjugated secondary detection antibody (1:2000). Analysis of endogenous levels of GLUTs on the PM. The PM fraction of cells was isolated according to standard protocols 60, 61. Briefly, the PM fraction was separated from the other membrane fraction of cells which includes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The expression levels of GLUT1, 2 and 3 in PM fraction were measured by Western-blot assays. A PM protein Na +/K + ATPase was detected as an internal standard. Calnexin, an ER membrane protein, was detected to exclude the contamination of PM by the other membrane fraction which includes the ER. The whole cell extracts were used to measure the total GLUT1, 2 and 3 in cells. Analysis of the levels of Myc tagged GLUTs on the PM. The pEGP-Myc-GLUT1 and pcDNA3-Myc-GLUT2 vectors which express GLUT1 and GLUT2 with Myc tag in their first exofacial loops, respectively, (generous gifts from Dr. Jeffrey Pessin), were used to construct pLPCX-Myc-GLUT1 and 2 vectors, respectively. pLPCX-Myc-GLUT3 vector expressing GLUT3 with Myc tag in its first exofacial loop was constructed by PCR amplification. The levels of Myc-GLUT1, 2 and 3 on the cell surface and in whole cells were measured by IF staining in a flow cytometry 62, 63. Briefly, at 48 h after cells were transduced with pLPCX-Myc-GLUT1, 2, or 3 vectors, cells were blocked in PBS with 2% FBS and stained with a Myc antibody (Roche) to detect Myc-GLUT1, 2, or 3 on cell surface in a flow cytometry. To determine the total levels of Myc-GLUT1, 2 or 3 in cells, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 before staining. The relative levels of Myc-GLUT 1, 2 or 3 on cell surface were calculated after normalization with their total levels in cells. Cells transduced with empty pLPCX vectors were employed as negative controls. Immunofluorescence staining. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of cells were performed according to standard protocols 21, 22. In brief, cells cultured on coverslips were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with methanol. Cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells expressing Myc-GLUT1 were incubated with anti-myc antibodies (9E10, Roche; 1:100) for overnight followed by Alexa Fluor\u00a2\u00e7 488-conjugated goat secondary antibody (Invitrogen; 1:200) for 1 h. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and examined by a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Actin polymerization assays. The polymeric actin fraction was isolated from cells according to standard protocols 64. Briefly, cells were homogenized in 400 \u00a5\u00ecl of lysis and F-actin stabilization buffer (50 mM PIPES at pH 6.9, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 5 mM EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% \u00a5\u00e2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM ATP, protease inhibitor cocktail) for 30 min at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. Following centrifugation (2,000 rpm, 5 min), half of the supernatant was transferred and centrifuged at 100,000 \u00a1\u00bfg (60 min, 37\u00a1\u00c6C) to pellet polymeric actin. The pellet containing polymeric actin was resuspended in 200 \u00a5\u00ecl of ice-cold water containing 10 \u00a5\u00ecM cytochalasin D. The polymeric actin samples were then diluted in 4\u00a1\u00bfSDS sample buffer for Western-blot assays. A monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Sigma) was used to detect polymeric actin. The whole cell extracts from the same amount of cells used for polymeric actin fraction isolation were used for the Western-blot assays to measure the levels of total actin in cells. For treatments of actin polymerization inhibitors, cells were treated with cytochalain D (5?20 \u00a5\u00ecM) or latrunculin B (1?10 \u00a5\u00ecM) for 4 h before assays. Control groups were treated with DMSO. Anchorage-independent growth assays. Anchorage-independent growth assays were performed in dishes coated with media containing 0.6% agarose. Cells were seeded on top of this layer in media containing 0.3% agarose. Colonies were stained and counted after 2?3 weeks. For galactose treatment, cells were cultured in media containing galactose (25 mM) but no glucose. Xenograft tumorigencity assays. Seven-week-old BALB/c nu/nu male athymic nude mice (Taconic) were used for xenograft tumorigenecity assays 65. Cells (5\u00a1\u00bf 10 6 ? 1\u00a1\u00bf10 7 in 0.2 mL PBS) were injected (s.c.) into nude mice (n = 10/group). After injection, mice were examined and tumor volumes were measured 3 times/week for 3?4 weeks. Tumor volume = \u00a8\u00f6 (length \u00a1\u00bf width 2). Statistical analysis. The differences in tumor growth among groups were analyzed for statistical significance by ANOVA, followed by Student\u00a1\u00afs t-tests using a GraphPad Prism software. All other P values were obtained using two-tailed Student t-tests. *: p<0.005; #: p<0.01; ##: p<0.05. Supplementary Material. 1. Acknowledgements.

                "text": "G-749, a novel FLT3 kinase inhibitor, can overcome drug resistance for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia\tAberrant activations of Fms-like tyrosine receptor kinase (FLT) 3 are implicated in the pathogenesis of 20% to 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). G-749 is a novel FLT3 inhibitor that showed potent and sustained inhibition of the FLT3 wild type and mutants including FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835Y, FLT3-ITD/N676D, and FLT3-ITD/F691L in cellular assays. G-749 retained its inhibitory potency in various drug-resistance milieus such as patient plasma, FLT3 ligand surge, and stromal protection. Furthermore, it displayed potent antileukemic activity in bone marrow blasts from AML patients regardless of FLT3 mutation status, including those with little or only minor responses to AC220 or PKC412. Oral administration of G-749 yielded complete tumor regression and increased life span in animal models. Thus, G-749 appears to be a promising next-generation drug candidate for the treatment of relapsed and refractory AML patients with various FLT3-ITD/FLT3-TKD mutants and further shows the ability to overcome drug resistance. Introduction. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematologic disorder in which the hematopoietic progenitor cells lose their ability to differentiate normally and continue to proliferate. Fms-like tyrosine receptor kinase (FLT) 3 plays an important role in normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis and is expressed in most AML blasts. 1 In 20% to 25% of AML patients, the FLT3 gene acquires an internal tandem duplication in the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), and this is associated with poor prognosis. 2,3 FLT3 point mutations within the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD) have also been detected in \u00a1\u00ad7% of AML patients. 4 FLT3-ITD or FLT3-TKD mutants undergo constitutive autophosphorylation of FLT3, causing aberrant signaling activation of several pathways such as Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5, and protein kinase B (AKT). 5-7 Activated FLT3-kinase mutations eventually induce transformation and tumorigenesis in hematopoietic cells and suppress normal myeloid differentiation and therefore are attractive therapeutic targets to treat AML. A number of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting FLT3 have been developed and clinically examined in AML patients 8,9: midostaurin (PKC412), the multiple kinase inhibitor in phase 3 trials in combinational chemotherapy 10; sorafenib in phase 1 trials in relapsed/refractory AML patients 11; and quizartinib (AC220), a selective FLT3 inhibitor in phase 2 trials. 12 PKC412 induced a 92% complete remission (CR) rate in FLT3-mutated AML in combinational chemotherapy, 13 sorafenib achieved a 23% CR in 65 FLT3-ITD AML patients after chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 11 and AC220 led to a 3% to 6% CR and 46% to 54% composite CR rate in 190 relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD?positive AML patients. 14,15 The development of drug resistance during the treatment of hematologic malignance has been a challenging issue for TKIs. Recent evidence suggests that the majority of patients treated with a single FLT3 inhibitor experienced only transient and partial response because of the development of drug resistance, which hinders treatment with FLT3-TKIs. 16-18 Various factors including point mutations, plasma inhibitory activity (PIA), protective effect by bone marrow stromal cells, and high levels of FLT3 ligand (FL) have been identified to confer FLT3 inhibitor drug resistance. Point mutations within the kinase domain of FLT3-ITD especially at the positions of N676, F691, and D835 lead to substantial resistance to AC220 and PKC412. 16,19 Additional resistance mutations to AC220 have also been described using in vitro models. 20 Drug resistance comes from PIA where the inhibition of PKC412 and CEP701 against FLT3 autophosphorylation was dramatically decreased in human plasma milieu. 21 The bone marrow microenvironment also contributes to the reduction of drug sensitivity in vivo. It was shown that bone marrow stromal cells support the survival of neighboring blast cells, resulting in the long-term survival and growth of leukemia cells. 22-26 The increased secretion of FL after induction therapy of cytarabine was also known to attenuate efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors. 27 Therefore, there is an unmet need for the next-generation FLT3 inhibitor to overcome drug resistance. Here, we report that a novel inhibitor, G-749, with a unique kinase inhibition profile is very potent against FLT3 kinase and provides sustained inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation and downstream effectors in FLT3-ITD?expressing cell lines. Using BaF3 model cells, we demonstrate that G-749 is highly potent against clinically known FLT3 mutants including gatekeeper and TKD that confer resistance to PKC412 and AC220. Notably, in comparison with PKC412 and AC220, G-749 shows several desirable characteristics to overcome other known drug resistances conferred by patient plasma, FL surge, and protection by stromal cells. Oral dosing of G-749 leads to complete tumor regression without relapse in the mouse xenograft model and increases survival in the bone marrow engraftment model. Furthermore, G-749 shows potent antileukemic activity in patient blasts harboring FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, and FLT3-ITD/TKD mutations through inhibition of phosphorylated (p) FLT3 and p?extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, including those with little or only minor response to AC220 and/or PKC412. Thus, we believe that G-749 is a promising drug candidate with strong therapeutic potential to overcome drug resistance for AML treatment. Methods. Kinase assay, cell culture, and FLT3 inhibitors. Biochemical assay for FLT3 wild type (WT) and FLT-D835Y was performed according to Perkin-Elmer time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer protocol using suggested experimental materials. The detailed methods are described in the supplemental Methods (available on the Blood Web site). Human leukemia cell line Molm-14 was kindly provided by Dr S. Kang, Emory School of Medicine; MV4-11, RS4-11, K562, HEL, and HS-5 were obtained from ATCC. The 6 different BaF3 cell lines were kindly provided by Dr J. Cools. 20,28 Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum or calf bovine serum, 2 mM of l-glutamine, and 1% of the antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin and cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00a1\u00c6C with 5% CO 2. G-749 was synthesized at Genosco (Cambridge, MA). Its synthetic process is described in supplemental Figure 1 and the supplemental Methods. The FLT3 inhibitors AC220 and PKC412 were purchased from LC Laboratories. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Cells were seeded at a density of 2 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 cells per well and treated with the indicated concentrations of test inhibitor for 72 hours at 37\u00a1\u00c6C. The conditioned medium (CM) was prepared from HS-5 cell culture for 5 days under routine culture conditions, clarified by centrifugation, and used immediately. The CM was added to complete medium at a final concentration of 35%. In coculture experiments, 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 AML blast cells were plated in 24-well plates containing 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 HS-5 monolayers and then cultured for at least 48 hours before the exposure of inhibitors. Cell viability was determined by an ATPLite assay (Perkin-Elmer). Caspase-3/7 activity was measured by using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega). For flow cytometry analysis experiments, MV4-11 cells were washed and resuspended in binding buffer containing fluorescein isothiocyanate?conjugated anti?annexin V antibody (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were stained with allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody (Becton Dickinson) to exclude contamination of HS-5 stromal cells. CD45-positive cells were gated and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The p-FLT3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and performed according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs protocol. The detail protocol of western analysis is described in the supplemental Methods. Patient samples. In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, bone marrow mononuclear cells from AML patients were collected with informed consent. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from Chonnam National University Hospital (Gwangju, South Korea) and Seoul St. Mary\u00a1\u00afs Hospital (Seoul, South Korea) for this study. The FLT3 mutation status was determined by the diagnosis protocol of each hospital organization. Mutations of the FLT3 gene were examined as previously reported. 4 Cryopreserved samples were thawed and incubated with culture medium enriched to 20% fetal bovine serum for 90 minutes before experimental procedures. Only samples with >70% viability were used for proceeding with tests. For blast viability, the blasts were treated with FLT3 inhibitors for 72 hours and supplemented with 50 ng/mL interleukin 3 and 50 ng/mL stem cell factor. Their viability was determined by an ATPLite assay. In vivo mouse models. The subcutaneous MV4-11 tumor model and the bone marrow?engrafted model are described in the supplemental Methods. For statistical analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using Prism 5.0 to examine statistical differences (details in the supplemental Methods). Results. Biochemical properties and selectivity of G-749. A novel small-molecule FLT3 kinase inhibitor, G-749, was designed and synthesized using a structure-based drug design approach (Figure 1A and supplemental Figure 1). It displayed potent inhibition of FLT3-WT and FLT3-D835Y mutants with biochemical IC 50 values of 0.4 and 0.6 nM, respectively (Table 1). Even when the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration was gradually increased up to \u00a1\u00c31 mM (supplemental Figure 2), G-749 still retained strong inhibitory activity with a low nanomolar IC 50 value (0.4 to 2.7 nM). These data demonstrate that G-749 is ATP competitive and shows sustained binding to the ATP binding pocket. Potent inhibition of FLT3 was confirmed in leukemia cells where G-749 inhibited autophosphorylation of FLT3 with an IC 50 value of \u00a1\u00c28 nM in FLT3-WT bearing RS4-11 and in FLT3-ITD harboring MV4-11 and Molm-14 cells (Figure 1C and supplemental Figure 3A-B). To evaluate its kinase selectivity, 100 nM G-749 was initially challenged against 282 kinases using the Millipore Kinase Profiler (supplemental Table 2). Major kinases inhibited by G-749 were further selected to determine their IC 50 potency (supplemental Table 1). This assay revealed that G-749 displayed a unique inhibition pattern. It was highly potent against FLT3, FLT3-D835Y, and Mer (1 nM of each kinase IC 50). The receptor tyrosine kinases (Ret, FLT1, Axl, Fms, fibroblast growth factor receptor [FGFR]-1, and FGFR3) and serine/threonine kinases (Aurora B and C) were also inhibited with IC 50 values of 9-30 and 6-24 nM, respectively. Other kinases including c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and epidermal growth factor receptor were not potently inhibited (IC 50 value of >300 nM); however, their mutants were significantly inhibited. Collectively, G-749 was identified as a novel and potent FLT3 inhibitor with a unique kinase inhibitory profile. Antiproliferative activity on leukemia cells. The antiproliferative activity of G-749 was assessed in several leukemia cell lines. G-749 showed strong antiproliferation of leukemia cells addicted to FLT3-ITD (MV4-11 and Molm-14) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it did not potently inhibit proliferation of leukemia cells without FLT3 expression (HEL and K562) or of non?FLT3-addicted cells with FLT3-WT (RS4-11) (Figure 1B and Table 1). The selective and potent antiproliferative activity of G-749 was found to come from the inhibition of FLT3-ITD because antiproliferation was rescued in FLT3-ITD?addicted BaF3 cells in the presence of interleukin 3 (supplemental Figure 5). The phosphorylation of downstream effectors in the FLT3 signaling pathway, such as p-STAT5, p-AKT, p-ERK1/2, and p-FoxO3a, was also potently inhibited by G-749 (Figure 1C). Similar inhibition of downstream effectors was seen in MV4-11 cells at levels comparable to AC220 and PKC412 (supplemental Figure 3C). G-749 treatment led to significantly increased active caspase-3/7 level and cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines (Figure 1F and supplemental Figure 3D). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that G-749 treatment increased apoptosis of MV4-11 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1G). Taken together, it causes antiproliferative activity through apoptosis. We next investigated the sustained potency of FLT3 inhibitors. After washout, G-749 sustained strong inhibition of p-FLT3, p-ERK and p-STAT5 in a time-dependent manner, whereas in comparison, AC220 and PKC412 gradually lost their inhibitory activity over 24 hours (Figure 1D-E). Remarkably, the potent inhibition of G-749 against FLT3 pathways sustained after washout was found to reflect prolonged antiproliferation in comparison with AC220 and PKC412 (supplemental Figure 5). It was found that the antiproliferation effect of G-749 also increased synergistically when used in combination with cytarabine (Figure 1H and supplemental Figure 6). Combination index calculated by CalcuSyn analysis showed good synergistic cell death in all tested concentrations (50% effective dose, 0.58264; 75% effective dose, 0.50659; and 90% effective dose, 0.44793), suggesting that G-749 is suitable for combinatorial therapy. Potent inhibition of G-749 against FLT3 mutants. To evaluate whether G-749 could inhibit several FLT3 mutants causing drug resistance, we examined its potency against BaF3 cell lines that stably express FLT3-ITD/N676D (ITD and ATP-binding domain mutation), FLT3-ITD/F691L (ITD and gatekeeper mutation), FLT3-D835Y (activation loop mutation), or FLT3-D835Y/N676D (activation loop and ATP-binding mutation). 19,20,29 Although PKC412 was less potent against BaF3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD/N676D (128 nM in IC 50) than those expressing FLT3-ITD/F691L or FLT3-D835Y, AC220 showed strong potency against cells expressing FLT3-ITD (3.7 nM in IC 50) but significantly decreased potency against those expressing FLT3-ITD/N676D, FLT3-ITD/F691L, FLT3-D835Y, and FLT3-D835Y/N676D. In comparison, G-749 showed strong potency against autophosphorylation of all tested FLT3 mutants with IC 50 of <10 nM (Figure 2A), whose inhibition level was closely correlated with antiproliferation activity (Table 1). Additionally, the direct comparison of phosphorylation levels using western blotting revealed that G-749 more potently inhibited the autophosphorylation of the FLT3-ITD/F691L and FLT3-D835Y with IC 50 of <8 nM than PKC412 and AC220 with IC 50 of 40-200 nM, respectively (Figure 2B-C). Effective inhibition of FLT3 pathways in high-FL milieu. We examined the potency of G-749 in high concentrations of FL milieu. Exogenous FL addition led to elevated p-FLT3 in a dose/time-dependent manner in BaF3 cells expressing FLT3-WT (supplemental Figure 7A-B) and in RS4-11 (supplemental Figure 3B). The increasing FL concentration in Molm-14 cells led to decreased cell death by AC220 up to \u00a1\u00ad2.5-fold and by G-749 up to \u00a1\u00ad1.9-fold (supplemental Figure 8). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that increased FL levels could impede the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors to some degree. However, even at a high FL level, G-749 showed more potent inhibition of p-FLT3, p-ERK1/2, and p-AKT than AC220 and PKC412 (Figure 2D-E). Notably, all tested FLT3 inhibitors potently and equally inhibited p-STAT5 in spite of high FL addition in Molm-14. FL addition did not activate p-STAT5 but slightly increased p-ERK and p-AKT levels in the BaF3 cells expressing FLT3-WT (supplemental Figure 7B), suggesting that the FL-activating p-ARK and p-ERK are responsible for slightly reducing efficacy of AC220 and G-749. Nevertheless, G-749 shows significant potency against p-FLT3, p-ERK1/2, and p-AKT in high-FL milieu. Potent inhibitory activity in normal and patient human plasma milieu. We examined the potency of G-749 in normal and patient plasma milieu to assess PIA. G-749 and AC220 equally inhibited p-FLT3 in culture medium and normal human plasma milieu in a dose-dependent manner, but PKC412 did not inhibit p-FLT3 in plasma milieu even at the high concentration of 1 \u00a5\u00ecM (Figure 3A, top and middle), which was further confirmed by ELISA analysis (supplemental Figure 9). We further examined the potency of G-749 and AC220 by using the bone marrow plasma from 10 AML patients who achieved CR (n = 7) or relapsed (n = 3) after induction therapy with cytarabine (supplemental Table 3). Western blot analysis revealed that G-749 consistently inhibited p-FLT3 in all 10 patient plasma milieus, but AC220 significantly lost its potency with big variations even at 1 \u00a5\u00ecM (P < .05 compared with 1 \u00a5\u00ecM G-749 group, n = 10) (Figure 3B), suggesting that the inhibition degree of AC220 highly varies from patient to patient. Of particular interest was the inhibition of FLT3 pathways in relapsed patient plasma milieu (patient 10). G-749 fully inhibited p-FLT3, p-STAT5, p-AKT, and p-ERK1/2, whereas AC220 could not inhibit them even at high concentrations (Figure 3C). To address the lost potency of AC220 in the relapsed patient milieu, we examined changes in p-FLT3 in normal plasma supplemented with FL and found that AC220 showed potent inhibition of p-FLT3 (Figure 3A, bottom); thus FL in plasma does not contribute to the lost potency. In addition, the plasma protein binding of AC220 and G-749 is \u00a1\u00ad98% and 99%, respectively, so that the free form of the compound is not responsible for the reduction in potency. Therefore, it is reasonable that other unknown factors in patient plasma may be involved in impeding the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitor including AC220 but excluding G-749 and remain to be addressed. Collectively, these PIA studies clearly suggest that G-749 effectively and potently inhibits FLT3 and downstream effectors in relapsed patient plasma. Effective inhibition in stroma-protecting milieu. We investigated the antileukemic activity of FLT3 inhibitors in drug-resistant milieu provided by bone marrow stromal cells known to promote leukemia cell survival. 22-25 Although AC220 caused only 50% cell death of MV4-11 even at the high concentration of 5 \u00a5\u00ecM in CM, G-749 and PKC412 similarly caused 90% cell death at the same concentration (Figure 4A). To determine if cell death caused by FLT3 inhibitor could be attenuated in the direct contact environment of stromal cell HS-5, we cocultured MV4-11 or patient blast of genotype FLT3-ITD (patient 12) with the HS-5 cell and then compared the potency of FLT3 inhibitors. In the case of MV4-11/HS-5 coculture (supplemental Figure 10), the treatment of 1000 nM G-749 and PKC412 caused 93.8% and 84.5% cell death, respectively, whereas that of 1000 nM AC220 caused 60.0%. Furthermore, in coculture of patient blast with HS-5 (Figure 4B), the treatment of 1000 nM G-749 and PKC412 caused 39.3% and 25.2% cell death, respectively, whereas that of 1000 nM AC220 showed 16.7%, similar to the DMSO control. These data strongly demonstrate that G-749 shows effective potent antileukemic activity even in the stroma-protecting milieu. To better understand how FLT3 inhibitors differentially respond to the stroma-protective milieu, we monitored changes in the FLT3 pathway in CM milieu. G-749 and AC220 similarly inhibited p-FLT3 and p-STAT5 in CM milieu. Of particular interest was the differential inhibition of p-ERK1/2. Unlike AC220, G-749 could potently inhibit p-ERK1/2 in Molm-14 and MV4-11 (Figure 4C and supplemental Figure 11), and its inhibition level against p-FLT3 in CM was found to be very similar to that in normal medium. G-749 showed potent inhibition against p-ERK1/2 in Molm-14 and against p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT in MV4-11, whereas AC220 showed little or no inhibition against p-ERK1/2 and/or p-AKT in both cells. Thus, the synergistically reduced inhibitory activity against p-ERK1/2 and/or p-AKT could be responsible for reduced antiproliferative activity in MV4-11 cells. Irrespective of influential and complex genetic backgrounds and protective bypass signals provided by the CM, G-749 persistently displayed potent inhibition against p-FLT3, p-ERK, and p-AKT. Effective antitumor activity in mouse models. To assess the in vivo pharmacodynamic effect of G-749, a single dose of G-749 HCl salt (10 mg/kg) was administered orally to subcutaneous MV4-11 xenograft mice and showed sustained inhibition of p-FLT3, p-STAT5, and p-ERK1/2 (Figure 5A-B). These data indicate that G-749 effectively inhibits the FLT3 pathway and that its inhibition lasts for 24 hours. Therefore, once-a-day oral dosing was expected to be sufficient for in vivo efficacy in the mouse model. To examine its antitumor efficacy, G-749 HCl salt was administered orally every day for 28 days to the MV4-11 xenograft mice. Significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed in the 3 mg/kg per day dosing group from 4 days onward, and apparent tumor regression was seen in the 10 and 30 mg/kg per day dosing group (Figure 5C). The mice dosed with 30 mg/kg per day were subsequently monitored for an additional 28 days after dosing stopped to examine if the tumor grows back. There was no tumor regrowth up to 28 days suggesting complete tumor regression. Additionally, in this study, weight loss and signs of gross toxicity were not observed in any dose group (supplemental Figure 12). We confirmed antitumor efficacy in an orthogonal model of bone marrow engraftment using Molm-14 cells, which physiologically differs from the subcutaneous MV4-11 xenograft model. In engrafted NOD/SCID mice, vehicle-treated mice showed expected clinical symptoms such as hind-limb paralysis, rough coat, and decreased activity and died within 9 days. But both 10 and 20 mg/kg per day dosing groups showed increased survival in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5D). Collectively, G-749 yields effective in vivo antitumor activity in 2 different leukemia animal models and is expected to yield great efficacy in clinical trials. Potent antileukemia activity in blasts of AML patients. To evaluate the antileukemia activity in primary cells, bone marrow blasts were obtained from 16 AML patients diagnosed as FLT3-WT, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835Y, and FLT3-ITD/D835Y (supplemental Table 4). The overall magnitude of antileukemic activity of G-749 was more effective than that of AC220 and PKC412 (Figure 6A and supplemental Figure 13). Remarkably, the antileukemic response of G-749 was \u00a1\u00ad75% to the blasts with FLT3-D835Y and \u00a1\u00ad50% to those with FLT3-ITD/D835Y that showed no or little response to AC220. These data are consistent with the findings from the BaF3 model cells. We further determined whether the antileukemic activity of G-749 couples with the inhibition of FLT3 pathways in patient blasts. In the patient 11 and 12 blasts with FLT3-ITD, G-749 showed more potent inhibition of p-FLT3 and p-ERK1/2 than AC220 and PKC412. In the patient 13 and 14 blasts with FLT3-D835Y, G-749 also showed more potent inhibition against p-FLT3 than AC220. Both G-749 and PKC412 effectively inhibited p-ERK1/2 in patient 13 and 14 blasts. Remarkably, in cases where they did not inhibit the p-FLT3 (patient 12), AC220 and PKC412 potently inhibited p-STAT5 (Figure 6B). These data suggest that G-749 shows inhibition of p-FLT3 and downstream effectors in patient blasts, regardless of FLT3 mutation status, eventually resulting in efficient antileukemic activity against blasts of AML patients. Discussion. We report the development of G-749 as a novel FLT3 inhibitor with potent activity against the FLT3-TKD mutants, and its sustained inhibition against FLT3 disease pathways was responsible for potent antileukemic activity via apoptosis in AML cells and patient blasts representing different FLT3 mutation status and even in drug-resistant environments such as high-FL milieu, stroma-protecting milieu, and relapsed patient plasma. Because it has been proposed that complete and enduring inhibition of FLT3 is critical for achieving clinical efficacy and may contribute to persistence of leukemic progenitors after treatment of FLT3 inhibitors, 8,9 the prolonged and potent inhibitory activity of G-749 against FLT3 mutants and aberrant downstream pathways could be very effective in treating relapsed and refractory AML patients. Kinase profiling revealed the potent inhibition of Mer and Aurora B by G-749. Mer kinase is known to be crucial in maintaining cell function, but its aberrant levels of Tyro3/Axl/Mer receptors and their ligands have been reported in numerous cancers including acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 30-32 Another emerging target for AML treatment is Aurora B, which plays an essential role in regulating chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. The inhibition of aurora B, more than aurora A, showed an antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect on in vitro and in vivo acute lymphoblastic leukemia and AML models. 33,34 Therefore, the inhibition of aurora B and Mer in addition to inhibition of activated FLT3 disease pathways may contribute to a significant antileukemic effect in AML therapy. Other kinases such as FLT1, FMS, and AXL are also known to play a role in the proliferation of hematologic malignant tumors, 35,36 and further studies with them and other possible targets if any remain to be addressed. FLT3-TKD mutants especially at N676, F691, and D835 were identified to confer resistance to PKC412 and AC220. 16,19 In this study, we demonstrated potent inhibitory activity of G-749 against FLT3-ITD/N676D, FLT3-ITD/F691L, and FLT3-D835Y mutants. Considering that model AML cell lines may have limitations in predicting the clinical response of FLT3 inhibitors, we used patient bone marrow blasts. G-749 showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic response in all leukemic blasts harboring FLT3-WT, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835Y, and FLT3-ITD/D835Y. In patient blasts, this cytotoxic activity was well correlated with inhibition of G-749 against p-FLT3 regardless of FLT3 mutant status, including those with no or little response to AC220 and PKC412. Therefore, G-749 is expected to potently inhibit FLT3 mutants conferring resistance to other TKIs in clinical study. The PIA was proposed to be a useful surrogate assay for the determination of FLT3 inhibition in patients receiving oral FLT3 inhibitor because plasma protein binding, which varies between patients, can influence the free drug level necessary for pharmacologic activity. 37-39 In this study, we demonstrated that G-749 showed significant inhibition of FLT3 and downstream pathways even in relapsed AML patient plasma; this caused significant loss of potency of AC220. We demonstrated that the high FL levels and freely available drug in plasma were not mainly responsible for the differential response of G-749 and AC220 in patient plasma. Rather, this differential could render the hypothesis that the plasma status of patients after the cytarabine treatment could significantly influence the efficacy of some TKIs targeting FLT3 leading to drug resistance; this remains to be addressed. A number of studies have reported that TKIs can rapidly eliminate circulating blasts in peripheral blood. However, this efficacy was restricted to leukemic blasts at the bone marrow probably because of the ability of the bone marrow stroma cells to protect hematologic malignancy. 40,41 In coculture milieu where bone marrow stroma HS-5 protected patient blasts or MV4-11 cells from dying, G-749 displayed antileukemic activity. In the CM from HS-5 where various hematopoietic growth factors 42 significantly altered FLT3 downstream pathways, it also showed potent inhibition of ERK1/2 and AKT activations via bypass signals that AC220 did not inhibit. These findings suggest that inhibition of the FLT3-ERK1/2 axis is indispensable to overcoming drug resistance. By overriding the survival bypass signals of leukemic cells provided by the stromal cells, G-749 is expected to yield strong antileukemic activity even in the complex bone marrow microenvironment. Conclusively, a novel FLT3 inhibitor, G-749, shows potent antileukemic activity in various drug-resistant conditions and could be the next-generation drug candidate for the treatment of relapsed and refractory AML.

                "text": "BRAF Inhibition Increases Tumor Infiltration by T cells and Enhances the Anti-tumor Activity of Adoptive Immunotherapy in Mice\tPurpose. Treatment of melanoma patients with selective BRAF inhibitors results in objective clinical responses in the majority of patients with BRAF mutant tumors. However, resistance to these inhibitors develops within a few months. In this study, we test the hypothesis that BRAF inhibition in combination with adoptive T-cell transfer (ACT) will be more effective at inducing long-term clinical regressions of BRAF-mutant tumors. Experimental Design. BRAF-mutated human melanoma tumor cell lines transduced to express gp100 and H-2D b to allow recognition by gp100-specific pmel-1 T-cells were used as xenograft models to assess melanocyte differentiation antigen-independent enhancement of immune responses by BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. Luciferase expressing pmel-1 T cells were generated to monitor T-cell migration in vivo. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, protein array and immunohistochemistry. Importantly, VEGF expression after BRAF inhibition was tested in a set of patient samples. Results. We found that administration of PLX4720 significantly increased tumor infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells in vivo and enhanced the antitumor activity of ACT. This increased T-cell infiltration was primarily mediated by the ability of PLX4720 to inhibit melanoma tumor cell production of VEGF by reducing the binding of c-myc to the VEGF promoter. Furthermore, analysis of human melanoma patient tumor biopsies before and during BRAF inhibitor treatment showed downregulation of VEGF consistent with the pre-clinical murine model. Conclusion. These findings provide a strong rationale to evaluate the potential clinical application of combining BRAF inhibition with T-cell based immunotherapy for the treatment of melanoma patients. Introduction. The identification of activating point mutations of the BRAF gene, present in approximately half of all human cutaneous melanomas, has proven to be a milestone for contributing not only to our understanding of melanoma biology but for changing the treatment and clinical outcomes of the disease (1). As a component of the RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK signal transduction pathway, BRAF is also mutated to a constitutively activated form in many other cancers, including thyroid, colorectal, and hairy cell leukemia (1?6). Although over 50 distinct mutations in BRAF have been described to date, a valine to glutamic acid substitution at amino acid position 600(V600E), is by far the most frequent, comprising more than 70% of BRAF mutations in melanoma (1, 7). Thus, BRAF(V600E) being so widely expressed, has provided a strong rationale for the development and clinical application of small molecule-based pharmaceutical inhibitors that selectively target BRAF(V600E) to treat patients with metastatic melanoma, whose treatment options are limited (8?11). Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that over half of melanoma patients with BRAF(V600E)-expressing tumors experience objective clinical responses to selective inhibitors of BRAF. However, complete and durable remissions were rarely observed in these patients, and disease relapses accompanied by BRAF inhibitor resistance typically occurred within a year (12, 13). The mechanisms that cause resistance are diverse, and include MAPK pathway re-activation by alternate means (14?19). Hence, to improve long term clinical responses and avoid selection of drug-resistant tumors, combinational therapies that target multiple pathways have been proposed (3, 4, 20). Although therapeutic approaches that combine small molecule-based inhibition of multiple signal transduction pathways has been an area of ongoing investigation, one alternative involves the combination of BRAF inhibitors with immune-based therapies. This approach appears particularly promising due to the emerging link between MAPK pathway activation in cancer and the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. For example, knockdown of BRAF(V600E) in melanoma cell lines has been shown to decrease the production of immunosuppressive soluble factors such as IL-10, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL-6 (21). Recent in vitro experiments showed that blocking of MAPK signaling in melanoma cells could increase the expression of melanocyte differentiation antigens (MDA), leading to improved recognition by MDA-specific T cells (22, 23). In addition, a study by Jiang et al showed that the paradoxical activation of MAPK promoted programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in melanoma cells resistant to BRAF inhibition (24). Perhaps most importantly, the exquisite specificity of recently developed small molecule inhibitors that target mutated oncogenes have shown little or no detrimental effects on immune cells that also utilize the MAPK pathway (23, 25). In the current pre-clinical study, we assessed whether the addition of a selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitor could improve the efficacy of T-cell based immunotherapy in vivo. We found that ACT with melanoma-specific T cells was much more effective in the context of concurrent BRAF inhibition, which led to increased T-cell infiltration of tumors that could be attributed largely to decreased VEGF production by the tumor cells. Furthermore, a subset of responding melanoma patients showed similar changes in the tumor microenvironment following BRAF inhibitor treatment, providing a strong rationale to explore the use of combination treatments involving MAPK pathway inhibition and T cell-based immunotherapy. Materials and Methods. Animals and cell lines. C57BL/6, C57BL/6J-Tyr-2J/J albino and pmel-1 TCR transgenic mice on a C57BL/6 background were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. B6 nude mice were purchased from the Taconic Farms. All mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free barrier facility at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Mice were handled in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. A375 (BRAF V600E +), Mel624 (BRAF V600E +/HLA-A2 +/MART-1 +), WM35 (BRAF V600E +/HLA-A2 +/gp100 +/MART-1 +), MEWO (BRAF Wild-Type/HLA-A2 +/MART-1 +) and C918 (BRAF Wild-Type) human melanoma cell lines and MC38 murine colon adenocarcinoma cell line were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), and penicillin-streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). MART-1-reactive DMF5 T cells were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (26) and cultured in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Valley Biomedical), \u00a5\u00e2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen) and recombinant human interleukin (IL)-2 (TECIN, National Cancer Institute Biological Resources Branch). Patient samples. Patients with metastatic melanoma possessing BRAF V600E mutation were enrolled on clinical trials for treatment with a BRAF inhibitor (RO5185426) or combined BRAF + MEK inhibitor (GSK2118436 + GSK1123212) and were consented for tissue acquisition per IRB-approved protocol. Tumor biopsies were performed pre-treatment (day 0), at 10?14 days on treatment. Generation of Luciferase expressing pmel-1 T cells. Splenocytes from pmel-1 mice were cultured in complete medium containing 300 I.U./ml IL-2, and 0.3 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml anti-mouse CD3 (BD Bioscience). After 24 h, the cells were infected with a retroviral vector encoding a modified firefly luciferase gene OFL and GFP, as previously described (27, 28). Three days after viral transduction, cells were sorted by a FACSAria (BD Bioscience) based on expression of GFP. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC). DCs were generated from murine bone marrow cells as previously described (29, 30). DCs pulsed with 10 \u00a5\u00ecM H-2D b-restricted gp100 peptide (KVPRNQDWL) for 3 hrs at 37\u00a1\u00c6C on day 7. After wash with PBS, DCs were immediately injected into mice. Lentiviral transduction of tumor cells. Lentiviral vectors and packaging vectors, VSV-G and \u00a5\u00c48.9, were cotransfected into 293T cells using lipofectamine 2000, and supernatant was collected after 36 hrs culture. A total of 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 tumor cells were pre-seeded in each well of 6-well plates for 6 hrs and spun at 850 g for 1 hr with 1 ml virus supernatant and 8 \u00a5\u00ecg/ml polybrene. The following day, the supernatant was removed and replaced with growth medium. Infected tumor cells were collected and sorted based on the expression of the reporter gene using a FACSAria. Adoptive transfer, vaccination, and treatment. B6 nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with 6 to 10 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 melanoma cells on day 0. When tumors were established, 1 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 luciferase-transduced pmel-1 T cells were adoptively transferred into tumor-bearing mice, followed by intravenous injection of 0.5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 6 peptide-pulsed DCs. IL-2 (5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 5 I.U./mouse) was intraperitoneally administered twice daily for 3 days after T cell transfer. 2 days after T cell transfer, PLX4720 (provided by PLexxikon) was administered for 3 days. PLX4720 powder was suspended in vehicle (3% DMSO, 1% methylcellulose) and administered by oral gavage daily (100mg/kg). In some experiments, mice were fed by a chow diet containing 417mg/kg PLX4720. For anti-VEGF treatment, anti-hVEGF Ab (hybridoma, A4.6.1 from ATCC) was administered at 250\u00a5\u00ecg/mouse on day 7, 9 and 11. Mouse IgG was used as control Ab. Since anti-tumor response of ACT is dependent on lymphodepletion(31), in some experiments using C57BL/6J-Tyr-2J/J albino mice as recipients, lymphopenia was induced by administering a nonmyeloablative dose (350 cGy) of radiation one day before adoptive transfer. Tumor sizes were monitored by measuring the perpendicular diameters of the tumors. All experiments were carried out in a blinded, randomized fashion. In vivo Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI). Mice were i.p. injected with 100 \u00a5\u00ecl of 20 mg/ml D-Luciferin (Xenogen). 8 mins later, mice anesthetized with isoflurane were imaged using an IVIS 200 system (Xenogen), according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs manual. Living Image software (Xenogen) was used to analyze data. Regions of interest (ROI) were manually selected and quantification is reported as the average of photon flux within ROI. The bioluminescence signal is represented as photons/s/cm 2/sr. IFN-\u00a5\u00e3 secretion assay. Melanoma cells were pre-treated with various concentrations of PLX4720 for 48 hrs, then were washed three times with culture medium. After counting, tumor cells were co-incubated with DMF5 or pmel-1 T cells at 5 \u00a1\u00bf 10 4 per well (1:1 ratio) as triplicates for 24 hrs, with or without adding back PLX4720. IFN-\u00a5\u00e3 production was determined in culture supernatants using an ELISA kit (BioLegend). Cytotoxicity assay. Melanoma cells were pre-treated with PLX4720 or vehicle (DMSO) for 48 hrs. After washing and counting, melanoma cells were labeled with 51Cr, and then co-incubated with activated pmel-1 T cells at different effector-to-target (E:T) ratios. 4 hrs later, 51Cr release was determined against target cells. Specific 51Cr release was calculated using the standard formula: ([sample release ? spontaneous release]/[total release ? spontaneous release]) \u00a1\u00bf 100%. hVEGF secretion assay. Melanoma cells were treated with various concentrations of PLX4720 for 24 hrs, with DMSO added as a vehicle control. The supernatants were then harvested for ELISA assay (R&D System), and the cells were harvested and counted. Proliferation assay. DMF5 cells (5\u00a1\u00bf10 4/well) were cultured with IL-2 (300 I.U./ml) at various concentrations with PLX4720 in an OKT3 pre-coated (1\u00a5\u00ecg/ml, 100\u00a5\u00ecl/well, 4\u00a1\u00c6C for overnight) 96-well plate for 56 hrs. [ 3H]Thymidine (5\u00a5\u00ecCi/ml) was then added for a further 16 hrs, and [ 3H]Thymidine incorporation was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. Cell viability assay. Melanoma cells were seeded in flat-bottom 96-well plates and treated with various concentration of PLX4720 for 72 hrs, with DMSO added as a vehicle control. Cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability assay (Promega). Protein arrays. A375 tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed 3 days after oral gavage of PLX4720, and tumors were resected and weighed. Tumors were homogenized and sonicated in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Cleared tumor lysates after centrifugation were tested using the Searchlight protein array, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Aushon Biosystems). ChIP arrays. A375 cells were treated with PLX4720 (1\u00a5\u00ecM) or DMSO for 2 hours, followed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, performed according to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs instructions (Millipore). Briefly, the protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked and immunoprecipitated with anti-c-myc, anti-p300 and anti-E2F1 antibodies or rabbit control IgG. After reversing the cross-linking, real-time PCR was used to amplify sequences corresponding to the promoter regions of human VEGF or control gene GAPDH. Flow Cytometric Analysis. Peripheral blood or tumors were harvested at the indicated time points. Tumor tissues were weighed and dissociated. After depletion of erythrocytes using ACK lysing buffer (Invitrogen), the remaining lymphocytes were treated with Fc blocking mAbs (anti-CD16/32 2.4G2) and then stained with mAbs against Thy1.1 and CD45 (BD Biosciences). Samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur or FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the avidin-biotin complex kit (Vector Laboratories). 9 melanoma patient tumor samples prior to and following treatment with BRAF inhibitor were stained for VEGF (1:100, Abcam) and mouse xenograft tumor samples were stained for CD3 (1:100, Abcam). Samples were appropriately optimized in our lab, and external controls were systemically used to avoid false-negative or false-positive staining. Percentages of VEGF-stained tumor cells were quantitated using microscopy and pathological examination. CD3+ T cell counts were performed on slides in 10 adjacent high-power fields (HPF, 400 \u00a1\u00bf) based on lymphocyte morphology. Quantitative PCR. Differential expression of VEGF in patient samples was assayed using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) with actin as control. mRNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using SuperScript VILO (Invitrogen) Statistical analysis. Comparisons of differences in continuous variables between two groups were done using Student\u00a1\u00afs t test. Differences in tumor size and T cell numbers among different treatments were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) repeated-measures function. The statistical analysis to compare survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier test. P-values are based on 2-tailed tests, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results. A human melanoma xenograft model to assess MDA-independent enhancement of immune responses by PLX4720. In order to investigate the effects of BRAF inhibition on tumor cell recognition by T-cells, three HLA-A2 + melanoma cell lines were pre-treated for 48h with titrated doses of the selective BRAF inhibitor PLX4720, and then co-cultured with HLA-A2-restricted MART-1 specific T cells. T-cell recognition, as measured by IFN-\u00a5\u00e3 secretion, increased in a dose-dependent fashion in the two melanoma cell lines expressing BRAF V600E, but not in the cell line expressing WT BRAF (Figs. S1A, B, and C). These results imply that PLX4720 can enhance MART-1 specific T-cell recognition of melanoma cells, consistent with the findings of a previous study showing upregulation of MDA by PLX4720 (23). Furthermore, when PLX4720 was added to the culture system, neither T-cell cytokine secretion function nor TCR mAb-induced proliferation was inhibited at concentrations as high as 1\u00a5\u00ecM (Figs. S1A?D). Thus, selective BRAF(V600E) inhibition does not significantly inhibit T-cell proliferation, similar to results we have previously reported that analyzed circulating immune cells from melanoma patients prior to and following treatment with a selective BRAF inhibitor (25). Although upregulation of MDA is one mechanism by which BRAF inhibition can enhance immune recognition of melanoma, we hypothesized that this class of antigen represents only a small fraction of melanoma-reactive T-cells in the tumor microenvironment, and that BRAF inhibition could be having other more global influences on the immune response. In order to study these potential alternative mechanisms, we engineered the human BRAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell line A375 to constitutively express high levels of the gp100 melanoma tumor antigen under control of the CMV promoter, thus eliminating any influence of the BRAF inhibitor on the expression of this MDA. The A375 cell line was also engineered to express murine H-2D b (Fig. 1A) to enable recognition by murine, gp100-specific transgenic pmel-1 T-cells. To test the validity of this approach, a series of in vitro experiments were performed to confirm that gp100 overexpression did, in fact abrogate enhanced T-cell reactivity induced by PLX4720. As shown in Fig. 1B, pmel-1 cells could only recognize and secrete IFN-\u00a5\u00e3 in response to A375 cells transduced to express both H-2D b and gp100 (A375/H-2D b/gp100). By contrast, human WM35 melanoma cells that naturally express gp100 were recognized when transduced with only H-2D b. As a further control, the murine colorectal carcinoma cell line MC38 that naturally expresses H-2D b could only be recognized by pmel-1 T-cells upon transduction with gp100. As shown in Figs. 1C and D, PLX4720 treatment could enhance pmel-1 T cell recognition of WM35 cells transduced with H-2D b, but not when these cells were also transduced to overexpress gp100. Similarly, PLX4720 treatment of A375 cells transduced to express both H-2D b and gp100 did not induce enhanced pmel-1 T-cell recognition, as measured by IFN-\u00a5\u00e3 secretion or cytolysis (Figs. 1E and S2). Therefore, this xenogeneic tumor model was determined to be appropriate for evaluating the effects on immune responses in vivo by PLX4720 that were independent of its impact on MDA expression. BRAF inhibition increases tumor infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells and enhances antitumor responses. We next sought to investigate whether PLX4720 could enhance the efficacy of adoptive T-cell transfer (ACT) in vivo. B6 nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with A375/H-2D b/gp100 melanoma cells and then treated with a combination of OFL-expressing pmel-1 T cells and peptide-pulsed DCs as previously described (30) followed by PLX4720 administration. Tumor sizes and T-cell migration were monitored over time. As shown in Figs. 2A and B, administration of PLX4720 led to ~10-fold higher luciferase intensity at the tumor site, compared with vehicle control. The increased T cell infiltration was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for CD3 and flow cytometry for Thy1.1+ pmel-1 T cells (Figs. S3 A, B, C and D). This higher level of tumor antigen-specific pmel-1 T-cell infiltration was associated with anti-tumor responses that were significantly better than those observed in mice treated with either PLX4720 or ACT alone (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2D, extended survival was also observed in the combination therapy group. The percentage of pmel-1 T cells in peripheral blood did not differ between the treatment groups (Fig. S4), suggesting that administration of PLX4720 can enhance the antitumor activity of ACT through increasing T-cell migration to tumor sites. To understand if expression of tumor antigen is necessary for T cell accumulation in tumors treated with PLX4720, B6 nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with non gp100-expressing A375/H-2D b melanoma cells and then treated with ACT in combination with PLX470 or vehicle control. As shown in Figs. S5 A and B, PLX4720 treatment cannot significantly increase T cell infiltration in A375/H-2D b tumors. These results suggest that tumor antigen expression is important for PLX4720-induced T cell infiltration into tumors. PLX4720 increases infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells only in tumors with a BRAF(V600E) mutation. The impact of RAF inhibitors on inhibiting ERK signaling in tumor cells with mutant BRAF has been extensively investigated (9, 20), but recent studies have also shown that BRAF inhibitors can enhance ERK signaling in cells with wild-type BRAF (32?34). To exclude the possibility that PLX4720 increased intratumoral T-cell accumulation via directly acting on the transferred T cells, we repeated the in vivo tumor treatment experiments using tumors with and without the BRAF(V600E) mutation. As expected, PLX4720 was not capable of inhibiting the in vitro growth of C918 melanoma cells, which have a wild-type BRAF (Fig. 3A). However, transduction with H-2D b and gp100 did render C918 cells susceptible to recognition by pmel-1 T cells (Fig. 3B). Comparing antitumor responses against C918 and A375 in vivo, we found that addition of PLX4720 to the ACT regimen led to an increase in luciferase intensity in A375/H-2D b/gp100, but not in C918/H-2D b/gp100 tumors (Figs. 3C and D). This result suggested that PLX4720 could only enhance infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells in tumors containing a BRAF(V600E) mutation, a finding that was confirmed using another BRAF(V600E) cell line WM35/H-2D b/gp100 (Figs. S6 A, B and C) and another wild-type BRAF cell line, MC38/gp100 (Figs. S7 A, B and C). PLX4720 increases infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells by inhibiting the production of VEGF in tumors. Since PLX4720 augmented the infiltration of T cells into BRAF mutant but not wild-type tumors, we next explored potential differences in the tumor microenvironment that may explain the enhanced migration of adoptively transferred T cells. We thus harvested tumors from A375/H-2D b/gp100 tumor-bearing mice treated with PLX4720 or vehicle alone, and made a tumor homogenate for protein array analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, PLX4720 treatment significantly reduced the hVEGF production in tumors. Since chemokines are known to be essential for mediating T-cell trafficking, we also tested the intratumoral expression of a panel of 12 chemokines, but found no significant differences between treatments. Inhibition of VEGF production was also confirmed by testing the supernatants from in vitro cell cultures of A375/H-2D b/gp100 cells treated with PLX4720 (Fig. S8). VEGF is a key angiogenic factor known to stimulate endothelial cell growth, survival, migration, lumen formation and vascular permeability (35). High levels of VEGF can induce vessel abnormalities that impair drug delivery and influx of immune cells into tumors, whereas vascular normalization by VEGF blockade or Rgs5 tumor cell deficiency can enhance the infiltration of adoptively transferred CD8 + T cells (35?37). Therefore, we next explored the possibility that reduced VEGF signaling in PLX4720-treated BRAF mutant tumors was responsible for the enhanced infiltration by adoptively transferred T cells. As shown in Figs. 4B and C, in vivo blockade of the VEGF/VEGFR interaction with anti-hVEGF Ab indeed enhanced pmel-1 T cell infiltration into A375/H-2D b/gp100 tumors. These results support the notion that administration of PLX4720 increases infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells via the inhibition of VEGF production by tumors. PLX4720 treatment reduces the binding of c-myc to the VEGF promoter. Given that PLX4720 treatment is known to reduce ERK activation in tumor cells carrying a BRAF V600E mutation (9), we hypothesized that PLX4720 may repress VEGF transcription via inhibiting ERK-activated transcription factors involved in the direct regulation of VEGF transcription. To test this, we first confirmed that PLX4720 treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK in A375/H-2D b/gp100 tumor cells (Fig. S9A). Examination of the proximal promoter region of human VEGF with TFSEARCH (http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html) identified potential consensus sites for multiple transcription factors, including c-myc, p300 and E2F1 (Fig. S9B and data not shown). Previous studies demonstrated that c-myc and p300 were ERK-activated transcription factors, and E2F1 was a PI3K-activated transcription factor (38?40). Using a ChIP assay, we demonstrated that c-myc is constitutively recruited to the VEGF promoter in A375/H-2D b/gp100 cells (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, c-myc promoter binding, but not that of p300 or E2F1, was reduced approximately 5-fold following PLX4720 treatment (Fig. S9C). These results strongly suggest that the spontaneous production of VEGF in A375/H-2D b/gp100 cells is regulated by c-myc, and that PLX4720 reduces VEGF transcription via inhibition of c-myc binding to the VEGF promoter. PLX4720-induced T-cell infiltration is abrogated in tumors over-expressing VEGF. To determine whether VEGF downregulation was indeed required for the enhanced intratumoral T-cell migration observed in PLX4720-treated mice, we next investigated whether this enhancement was impaired in tumors constitutively over-expressing VEGF. Thus, A375/H-2D b/gp100 melanoma cells were transduced with hVEGF under the transcriptional control of the CMV promoter (Fig. 5A). VEGF-transduced melanoma cells maintained sensitivity to PLX4720 (Fig. S10), but no longer demonstrated a large decrease in VEGF secretion in response to PLX4720 treatment (Fig. 5B). We next analyzed B6 nude mice bearing either A375/H-2D b/gp100 or A375/H-2D b/gp100/VEGF tumors following treatment with ACT and PLX4720 by monitoring T-cell migration. As shown in Figs. 5C and D, augmented T-cell infiltration in response to PLX4720 treatment was abrogated in the A375/H-2D b/gp100/VEGF tumors. These results support the notion that BRAF inhibition enhances T-cell migration to tumors through downregulation of VEGF production. Intratumoral VEGF downregulation correlates with increased T-cell infiltration in melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitor. In light of our results in the mouse model, we next investigated whether VEGF was also downregulated in the tumors of melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitor. Pre-treatment or on-treatment tumor biopsies were harvested from 9 melanoma patients, and immunohistochemical staining for VEGF was performed. As shown in Figs. 6A and B, BRAF inhibitor treatment significantly downregulated VEGF expression in the majority (7/9) of patients, results which were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figs. S11A and B). Examination of intratumoral T-cell infiltration was also performed by staining the tumor samples for CD8 and reported separately by Dr. Jennifer Wargo\u00a1\u00afs group. These results of patient samples are consistent with the data observed in the mouse model, and suggest that treatment of patients with BRAF inhibitor may also increase T-cell infiltration into tumors via inhibition of intratumoral VEGF production. Discussion. To date, a number of specific kinase inhibitors that target BRAF V600E to treat melanoma have been generated and applied in clinical trials (8?10), with 50 ? 70% of patients with BRAF(V600E) mutation showing objective clinical responses to treatment. However, in spite of these high initial response rates, responses are transient and recurrences with treatment-resistant disease typically occur within a year (12, 13, 41). Therefore, combinatorial approaches to treat melanoma are being actively explored. ACT therapy using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is one of the most well-established immunotherapeutic approaches for cancer treatment (42). However, one of the important factors that limit the efficacy of this therapy is lack of migration of T cells into the tumor site (43, 44). Using a very sensitive bioluminescence imaging (BLI) system in murine models (27), we have previously shown that transduction of tumor-specific T cells with the CXCR2 chemokine receptor can improve the intratumoral migration of adoptively transferred T cells and enhance antitumor responses in murine models (28). In the current study, we tested whether the addition of a BRAF inhibitor could similarly enhance the anti-tumor activity of ACT in vivo. Using a xenograft human melanoma model, A375 transduced to express hgp100 and H-2D b, we found that administration of PLX4720 could increase tumor infiltration of adoptively transferred gp100-specific T cells and improved antitumor responses. This effect was partially mediated by PLX4720-induced inhibition of VEGF production in melanoma cells. Analysis of tumor biopsies derived from BRAF inhibitor-treated melanoma patients were consistent with the results found in the murine model, showing that BRAF inhibition could significantly downregulate tumoral VEGF expression, which correlated with increased tumor infiltration by T cells. Furthermore, our findings indicated that BRAF inhibition is capable of enhancing the antitumor activity of ACT therapy without impairing T-cell function. VEGF, an immunosuppressive factor secreted by many tumors, can negatively impact the activity of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and stimulate the growth of tumor vasculature (45?47). RNAi-mediated inhibition of BRAF(V600E) can decrease the production of VEGF in melanoma cells with mutant BRAF(V600E) (21); however, it has remained unclear how constitutive activation of the BRAF-MAPK signaling pathway can influence VEGF production. Using a ChIP assay, we demonstrated that c-myc, but not p300 or E2F1, is constitutively recruited to the VEGF promoter and that transcription and production of VEGF is reduced by PLX4720 in melanoma cells harboring the V600E mutation. Blocking of VEGF/VEGFR-2 interactions can upregulate endothelial adhesion molecules in tumor vessels, which can in turn increase the infiltration of leukocytes in tumors (48). Furthermore, administration of anti-VEGF Ab can significantly increase infiltration of adoptively transferred CD8 + T cells into tumor sites and improve antitumor responses (37). Using our xenogeneic mouse tumor model, we found that PLX4720 treatment significantly reduced the production of tumoral VEGF, and that the increased accumulation of tumor-infiltrating T cells was abrogated in melanoma over-expressing VEGF. Administration of anti-hVEGF Ab also increased tumor infiltration of pmel-1 T cells by 2 to 3-fold. Since PLX4720 treatment typically induced 5?10 fold higher levels of T-cell infiltration compared with vehicle treatment, it suggests that reduction of VEGF/VEGFR interactions is not the only mechanism responsible for the increased T-cell infiltration. Using gp100-negative tumor cells, PLX4720 treatment failed to increase T cell trafficking to tumor sites. These findings suggest that tumor antigen expression also plays an important role in T cell accumulation in tumors. These findings are consistent with our previous report that IFN-\u00a5\u00e3 produced by tumor-antigen-activated T cells can induce CXCL10 expression in tumors, in turn resulting in more T cell accumulation (49). Further studies will be required to identify additional mechanisms that may contribute to this combinational therapy regimen. In this study, we have shown that administration of PLX4720 can clearly enhance the infiltration of transferred T cells and improve the antitumor responses induced by ACT. Our data is consistent with a recent clinical study showing that treatment of melanoma patients with a BRAF inhibitor leads to augmented T-cell infiltration into metastatic sites (11). Using a BRAF(V600E) driven murine model, Koya et al have recently shown that BRAF inhibition can increase MAPK signaling and intratumoral cytokines secretion by adoptively transferred T cells, leading to a beneficial anti-tumor effect (50). Collectively, the emerging evidence strongly suggests that combinations of selective BRAF inhibitors with immunotherapy will result in enhanced benefits for melanoma patients in the very near future. Translational Relevance. BRAF-targeted therapy has resulted in objective responses in the majority of melanoma patients harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation, however the median duration of response is less than a year. There is evidence for immune evasion in BRAF-mutant melanoma which may be reversed with BRAF?targeted therapy, strongly implicating the rationale for a BRAF-targeted therapy in combination with immunotherapy. Adoptive T-cell transfer (ACT) therapy using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is one of the most promising immunotherapeutic approaches for melanoma treatment resulting in objective responses for over 50% of treated patients. Here, we report that BRAF inhibition in melanoma increases the T-cell infiltration into tumors, via decreased VEGF production, and enhances the anti-tumor activity of ACT therapy. Our findings provide a rationale of combining BRAF inhibitor with ACT therapy for clinical application to improve durable response rates to therapy. Acknowledgments.

Here we describe a Type-II T315I inhibitor GNF-7, based upon a 3,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one scaffold which is capable of potently inhibiting wild-type and T315I Bcr-Abl as well as other clinically relevant Bcr-Abl mutants such as G250E, E255V, F317L and M351T in biochemical and cellular assays. In addition, GNF-7 displayed significant in vivo efficacy against T315I-Bcr-Abl without appreciable toxicity in a bioluminescent xenograft mouse model using a transformed T315I-Bcr-Abl-Ba/F3 cell line that has a stable luciferase expression. GNF-7 is amongst the first type II inhibitors capable of inhibiting T315I to be described and will serve as a valuable lead to design next generation Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors. INTRODUCTION. The successful development of the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib for the treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) has provided the paradigm for the development of a host of other small molecule inhibitors targeting kinase whose activity become deregulated in cancer. One major problem facing the development of selective protein kinase inhibitors is the emergence of drug resistance caused by mutations in the kinase domain. Extensive in vitro and clinical work has elucidated a large number of mutations that confer resistance to imatinib either by directly influencing the drug binding site or by disfavoring the conformational rearrangements required for imatinib to bind. Several second generation Bcr-Abl inhibitors have been developed including nilotinib (Tasigna\u00a2\u00e7, AMN107) (Weisberg et al., 2005), bosutinib (SKI-606) (Puttini et al., 2006), dasatinib (Sprycell\u00a2\u00e7, BMS-354825) (Shah et al., 2004) that are capable of inhibiting most of the known Bcr-Abl mutants with the exception of the so-called \u00a1\u00aegatekeeper\u00a1\u00af mutation T315I (O\u00a1\u00afHare et al., 2005). Several small molecules capable of inhibiting the T315I mutant in biochemical and cellular assays have been reported. AG-490, an inhibitor of Jak2 which is a kinase implicated in signal transduction downstream of Bcr-Abl, was shown to induce apoptosis in Ba/F3-Bcr-Abl-T315I cell line (Samanta et al., 2006). AP23846, originally developed as a Src kinase inhibits T315I Bcr-Abl dependent cellular proliferation (IC 50 of 297 nM) but also inhibits parental Ba/F3 cell lines suggesting it possesses additional intracellular targets. VX-680 (MK-0457), originally developed as an aurora kinase inhibitor exhibits potent enzymatic inhibition of T315I-Abl (IC 50 of 30 nM) but only modestly inhibited cellular auto-phosphorylation (IC 50 of ca. 5 uM) of Ba/F3 transformed with T315I Bcr-Abl (Carter et al., 2005). Another Aurora kinase inhibitor, PHA-739358 currently being investigated in a phase II clinical trial for patients with relapsed chronic myelogeneous leukemia exhibited potent inhibition of T315I-Abl enzyme (IC 50 of 5 nM). Crystallographic analysis of PHA-739358 in complex with T315I-Abl reveals (Modugno et al., 2007) that the isoleucine side chain of T315I mutant does not cause a steric clash with PHA-739358 in contrast to imatinib. TG101114 (Quintas-Cardama et al., 2007), a thiazole?based inhibitor also exhibited good potency (IC 50 of 50 nM) against T315I mutant enzyme and exhibited reasonable in vivo efficacy in a xenograft mouse model harboring T315I. SGX393 (O\u00a1\u00afHare et al., 2008) derived from pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine scaffold class was originally identified using a crystallographic fragment-based screening approach, displayed excellent activity (IC 50 of 7.3 nM) against T315I-Bcr-Abl-Ba/F3. Interestingly, SGX393 is considerably less potent against P-loop mutations such as E255V compared with T315I. Another reported class of Bcr-Abl inhibitors is exemplified by ON012380 which is claimed to be a non-ATP-competitive Bcr-Abl inhibitor potently inhibits imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants such as T315I in cellular and biochemical assays with IC 50 values below 10 nM (Gumireddy et al., 2005). ON012380 appears to target substrate binding site of Abl kinase domain but numerous other cellular kinases are inhibited by this compound. It should be noted that most T315I inhibitors disclosed to date except ON012380 are categorized as Type-I kinase inhibitors which bind exclusively to the ATP binding site of kinase with the kinase in an otherwise catalytically competent state. Recently, several compounds from the Type-II class that recognize the \u00a1\u00b0DFG-out\u00a1\u00b1 conformation have rarely been reported to inhibit T315I. These include the 9-(arenethenyl)purine analogue, AP24163 (Huang et al., 2009), and the biaryl urea-derived inhibitors NVP-BBT594 and NVP-BGG463 (Chimia 2008; 62; 579) and DSA series compounds(Seeliger et al., 2009). AP24163 exhibited modest potency (IC 50 400 nM) against T315I M351T in biochemical and cellular assays and DSA8 showed great potency (IC 50 33 nM) on T315I enzyme along with moderate anti-proliferatve activity (IC 50 500 nM) evaluated using T315I Bcr-abl transformed Ba/F3 cells. A co-crystal structure with wild-type and gatekeeper mutant of Src with a PP1-based type II inhibitor revealed how the inhibitor could leave ample space for an enlarged gatekeeper residue (Dar et al., 2008) RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. Here we describe a Type-II T315I inhibitor, based upon a 3,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one scaffold which occupies the ATP binding cleft as well as an immediately adjacent hydrophobic pocket of Abl kinase domain. A representative member of this class, GNF-6 (Okram et al., 2006) was crystallized with Abl and shown to bind in the Type-II conformation. The pyrimidopyrimidinone inhibitor descried here, GNF-7 is capable of inhibiting wild-type and T315I Bcr-Abl activity in biochemical and cellular assays and also inhibits other clinically relevant Bcr-Abl mutants such as G250E, E255V, F317L and M351T. We also demonstrate that GNF-7 is capable of inhibiting T315I-Bcr-Abl dependent tumor growth in a murine model of CML (Weisberg et al., 2005). Design Rationale for a Type-II T315I Bcr-Abl Inhibitor. An examination of the co-crystal structures of imatinib (Nagar et al., 2002) nilotinib (Weisberg et al., 2005) and dasatinib (Tokarski et al., 2006) with Abl demonstrate that all three inhibitors form a critical hydrogen bond with the side-chain hydroxyl group of T315I and would also require a significant rearrangement of their binding conformation to accommodate a larger residue at the gatekeeper position. Mutation of this gatekeeper position appears to be a general theme for resistance to kinase inhibitors as exemplified clinically by resistance of T790M EGFR to Erolotinib (Pao et al., 2005) and experimentally by the resistance of G697R FLT3 to PKC412 and SU5614 (Cools et al., 2004), T341M c-Src to the pyrido[2,3-d]pyridinone (PP58), T681I PDGFR\u00a5\u00e2to the pyrido[2,3-d]pyridinone (PP58) and imatinib, and V561M FGFR1 to pyrido[2,3-d]pyridinones (PP58) (Blencke et al., 2004; Cools et al., 2003). It is well known that a variety of potent inhibitors of the Src-family such as AZD0530 (Hennequin et al., 2006) and bosutinib also show potent inhibition of Abl kinase. Indeed the 2-amino-5-carboxamidothiazoles, dasatinib compound class was originally developed as an inhibitor of the Src-family kinase Lck to inhibit T-cell activation with potential utility as an immunosuppressant (Wityak et al., 2003). Likewise pyrimidopyrimidones such as PD173955 were originally developed as inhibitors of Src kinase (Kraker et al., 2000) and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such a EGFR, FGFR, PDGFR and c-Kit (Panek et al., 1997; Klutchko et al., 1998) and were only later demonstrated to possess potent cellular and enzymatic activity on wild-type and mutant forms of Bcr-Abl (Wisniewski et al., 2002; Dorsey et al., 2000). Co-crystal structures of PD173955 with Abl (PBD:1m52) demonstrate that these compounds bind to the ATP-binding site with the kinase otherwise assuming a conformation normally utilized to bind ATP (Type I binding) (Nagar et al., 2002). Interestingly PD173955 exhibits approximately 30-fold more potent cellular activity against Bcr-Abl relative to imatinib presumably as a consequence of possessing a much higher affinity to the ATP-binding pocket (Wisniewski et al., 2002). In contrast, imatinib only exhibits cellular activity against Bcr-Abl and some receptor kinases, such as KIT, PDGFR and DDR, but is not known to inhibit the cellular activity of any Src-family kinases. The crystal structure of imatinib bound to the kinase domain of c-Abl (Nagar et al., 2002) demonstrated that the compound binds to a conformation of the kinase where the activation loop is in a so-called \u00a1\u00b0in-active\u00a1\u00b1 conformation first visualized in the inactive conformation of the insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase (Type II binding). This binding conformation allows the piperazine-benzamide moiety of imatinib to access an additional hydrophobic pocket directly adjacent to the ATP binding site. By superimposing the bound conformation of PD173955 and nilotinib as depicted in Figure 1, it is clear that additional functionality can be appended to the dichlorophenyl ring of PD173955 to access this adjacent hydrophobic pocket to create a new \u00a1\u00b0hybrid\u00a1\u00b1 structure (Okram et al., 2006; Cowan-Jacob et al., 2004). We hypothesized that the resulting hybrid compound might be able to inhibit the T315I mutation due to enhanced affinity both to the hinge-binding region and to the hydrophobic back-pocket, in addition to not forming a hydrogen bond to the gatekeeper position. In vitro Potency of GNF-7. To assess the cellular activity of the compounds, we tested them against wild-type and mutant Bcr-Abl transformed Ba/F3 cells. Wild-type Ba/F3 cell survives in the presence of interlukin-3 (IL-3) but Ba/F3 cell transformed by oncogenic kinase such as Bcr-Abl becomes capable of growing in the absence of IL-3 and provides a robust and commonly used assay for selective kinase inhibition (Melnick et al., 2006; Warmuth et al., 2007). The first hybrid compound we made, GNF-6 exhibited an IC 50 of less than 5 nM on wild-type Bcr-Abl and an IC 50 of 303 nM on T315I while exhibiting non-specific inhibition of untransformed Ba/F3 cells with an IC 50 of 1.7 uM (Table 1). GNF-6 also effectively inhibited cellular kinase autophosphorylation of T315I-Bcr-Abl-Ba/F3 with an IC 50 of 243 nM further demonstrating that the antiproliferative activity against this mutant correlates with direct inhibition of the T315I-Abl enzyme. A co-crystal structure (Okram et al., 2006) of GNF-6 with Abl revealed that the compound bound to a conformation that was virtually indistinguishable from that used by imatinib which clearly validates the design strategy (Liu and Gray, 2006). We next evaluated how altering the structure in the hinge binding region and hydrophobic back pocket might change the potency of cellular inhibition. We replaced the amino-pyrimidine hinge binding motif of GNF-6 with the phenylaminopyrimidine motif which is known to form a stronger interaction with the kinase hinge residues as shown for GNF-7 and GNF-8. These modifications improved absolute cellular potency against T315I as well as increase the ratio for selectivity relative to untransformed Ba/F3 cells. In addition, these modifications resulted in improved inhibitory potency on T315I enzyme as well as against T315I cellular autophosphorylation. We next incorporated a 3-methylimidazole by analogy to nilotinib and the resulting compound GNF-9 also demonstrated excellent activity against wild-type and mutant Bcr-Abl compared with absence of this methylimidazole (Table 1). In particular, this methylimidazole of GNF-9 significantly contributes to excellent potency of GNF-9 against T315I enzyme. In addition, GNF-7 displayed excellent growth inhibitory activity against human colon cancer cells (Colo205 and SW620) while a non cancer cell line, HEK293T was not particularly sensitive to inhibition by GNF-7 as described in Table 3. Due to the broad selectivity profile of GNF-7, further profiling of a larger panel of human cancer cell lines would potentially reveal additional utility for this inhibitor. Kinase Selectivity of GNF-7. We next investigated the kinase selectivity of GNF-7 against a panel of 41 recombinant kinase enzymes and on a panel of Ba/F3 cell lines transformed with diverse set of tyrosine kinases as summarized in Tables 2 and ?and3.3. This analysis revealed that the compound possessed a lack of selectivity, inhibiting both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. In addition to the large number of kinases inhibited by PD173955, kinases such as JNK, Bmx, and c-Raf were also inhibited by GNF-7. GNF-7 however exhibited some selectivity (4 to 100-fold) for T315I Bcr-Abl (IC 50 = 11 nM) relative to kinases such as TPR-Met, NPM-ALK, JAK-3, Flt-3. Although the co-crystal structure of GNF-6 with Abl demonstrates binding to the inactive conformation (type II), it is possible that an alternative binding conformation is exploited when binding to other kinases. Further work will be required to investigate to what extent broad inhibition of mutant alleles of Bcr-Abl can be achieved while still maintaining significant selectivity relative to other kinases. Considering that the gatekeeper residue is a crucial kinase selectivity determinant (Cools et al., 2004), this will likely present a significant challenge. In vivo Efficacy and Toxicity of GNF-7. In order to investigate whether GNF-7 could inhibit wild-type and T315I Bcr-Abl at well tolerated doses in vivo, we investigated the tumor efficacy in luciferase xenograft model. One short coming of the original PD173955 compound was a poor pharmacokinetic profile in mice. GNF-7 exhibited excellent pharmacokinetic parameters in mice as depicted in Table 4, with good systemic exposure (AUC = 26656 hrs*nM, C max = 3.6 uM) along with reasonable half life (t 1/2=3.2 hrs) and favorable oral bioavailability (BAV=36%) being observed following oral administration of a single dose of 20 mg/kg. GNF-7 displayed significant in vivo efficacy against T315I-Bcr-Abl in the bioluminescent xenograft mouse model using a transformed T315I-Bcr-Abl-Ba/F3 cell line that has a stable luciferase expression. As illustrated in the Figures 2, light emission from mice that were administered an oral dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg of GNF-7 once per day was significantly (T/C 38% and 23%, respectively) reduced compared with that from untreated control mice, indicating that GNF-7 effectively inhibits tumor growth of T315I-Bcr-Abl-Ba/F3 cells in mice at low doses (10 mg/kg). However, appreciable (> 10%) body weight loss was observed in mice treated with doses of GNF-7 of 20 mg/kg and above which is a common symptom of in vivo toxicity. However, the 10 mg/kg dosing group exhibited only a very small weight change as plotted in the Figure 3. The significant body weight loss in the 20 mg/kg group forced the dosing to be discontinued at day 6. An acceptable therapeutic index of GNF-7 would be anticipated at around 10 mg/kg dose as remarkable efficacy was observed with little body weight change at 10 mg/kg dose. SIGNIFICANCE. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to design a Type-II inhibitor that can circumvent the T315I Bcr-Abl \u00a1\u00b0gatekeeper\u00a1\u00b1 mutation by bridging the ATP and allosteric binding site using a linker segment that can accommodate a larger gatekeeper residue. The ability of the compounds to tolerate diverse gatekeeper amino acids results in structures with broad kinase selectivity profiles. This demonstrates that Type-II inhibitors as a class are not necessarily more selective than Type-I inhibitors. GNF-7 is likely to serve as a valuable starting point for developing Type?II inhibitors for a variety of kinases. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.
