                "text": "Cost comparison of predictive genetic testing versus conventional clinical screening for familial adenomatous polyposis.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\nMutations of the APC gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a hereditary colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome.\n\n## AIMS\nTo conduct a cost comparison analysis of predictive genetic testing versus conventional clinical screening for individuals at risk of inheriting FAP, using the perspective of a third party payer.\n\n## METHODS\nAll direct health care costs for both screening strategies were measured according to time and motion, and the expected costs evaluated using a decision analysis model.\n\n## RESULTS\nThe baseline analysis predicted that screening a prototype FAP family would cost $4975/ pound3109 by molecular testing and $8031/ pound5019 by clinical screening strategy, when family members were monitored with the same frequency of clinical surveillance (every two to three years). Sensitivity analyses revealed that the genetic testing approach is cost saving for key variables including the kindred size, the age of screening onset, and the cost of mutation identification in a proband. However, if the APC mutation carriers were monitored at an increased (annual) frequency, the cost of the genetic screening strategy increased to $7483/ pound4677 and was especially sensitive to variability in age of onset of screening, family size, and cost of genetic testing of at risk relatives.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn FAP kindreds, a predictive genetic testing strategy costs less than conventional clinical screening, provided that the frequency of surveillance is identical using either strategy. An additional significant benefit is the elimination of unnecessary colonic examinations for those family members found to be non-carriers.\n",

Defects in the base excision repair gene MUTYH are responsible for MUTYH-associated polyposis and CRC predisposition as an autosomal recessive trait. Numerous reports have suggested MUTYH mono-allelic variants to be low penetrance risk alleles. We report a large collaborative meta-analysis to assess and refine CRC risk estimates associated with bi-allelic and mono-allelic MUTYH variants and investigate age and sex influence on risk.\n\n## METHODS\nMUTYH genotype data were included from 20\u2009565 cases and 15\u2009524 controls. Three logistic regression models were tested: a crude model; adjusted for age and sex; adjusted for age, sex and study.\n\n## RESULTS\nall three models produced very similar results. MUTYH bi-allelic carriers demonstrated a 28-fold increase in risk (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.95-115). Significant bi-allelic effects were also observed for G396D and Y179C/G396D compound heterozygotes and a marginal mono-allelic effect for variant Y179C (odds ratio (OR)=1.34; 95% CI: 1.00-1.80). A pooled meta-analysis of all published and unpublished datasets submitted showed bi-allelic effects for MUTYH, G396D and Y179C (OR=10.8, 95% CI: 5.02-23.2; OR=6.47, 95% CI: 2.33-18.0; OR=3.35, 95% CI: 1.14-9.89) and marginal mono-allelic effect for variants MUTYH (OR=1.16, 95% CI: 1.00-1.34) and Y179C alone (OR=1.34, 95% CI: 1.01-1.77).\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\noverall, this large study refines estimates of disease risk associated with mono-allelic and bi-allelic MUTYH carriers.\n",

                "text": "Possible role of telomerase activation in the cancer predisposition of patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancers.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\nHereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC syndrome; also called Lynch syndrome) is one of the most common cancer predisposition syndromes. Most cases of cancer associated with this syndrome are due to the inheritance of germline mutations in genes that encode proteins required for DNA mismatch repair; defects in these proteins allow mutations to accumulate more rapidly in the DNA and influence the rate of cancer development. Recent studies indicate that the reactivation of the activity of telomerase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of chromosomal ends, in somatic cells may play a role in carcinogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the expression of telomerase in normal and cancerous colorectal tissue specimens from HNPCC and non-HNPCC patients.\n\n## METHODS\nThe polymerase chain reaction-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol was used to assay telomerase activity in colorectal tissue specimens from 33 non-HNPCC patients (23 normal, 26 polyps, and 37 cancer specimens) and from 24 HNPCC patients (24 normal, 0 polyps, and 28 cancer specimens).\n\n## RESULTS\nThirty-one of 37 carcinoma samples from 18 non-HNPCC patients and 27 of 28 carcinoma samples from 24 HNPCC patients were found to be positive for telomerase activity. Whereas only one of 23 normal mucosa samples from 23 non-HNPCC patients was found to have (weak) telomerase activity, eight of 24 normal mucosa samples from 24 HNPCC patients were positive for telomerase; the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (two-sided P = .0226).\n\n## IMPLICATION\nThis study generates the hypothesis that genetic defects in individuals with HNPCC syndrome facilitate the reactivation of telomerase activity, a process which may be associated with their predisposition to develop cancer.\n",

Loss of heterozygosity was detected in 62% (18 of 29 patients) of the tumors at one or more of these microsatellites. Eight of the 18 patients exhibited deletions in the region at 18q21.1. This chromosomal band is known to contain a tumor suppressor gene (DCC) whose expression is frequently inactivated in several types of cancer. Ten other patients had deletions in regions not included in the DCC locus. Five of these patients revealed a common deletion at the D18S50 locus (18q23), and the other five patients had deletions in various other regions of the chromosome. No apparent correlation between loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 18 microsatellites and the clinical stage was found in this series. The results indicate that, in addition to the DCC locus, the 18q23 region is likely to contain a second tumor suppressor gene relevant to breast carcinogenesis. Four percent of all microsatellites tested in these patients showed allelic differences in the sizes of repeat units between tumor and the corresponding constitutional DNAs. The pattern of allele instability observed in breast carcinoma differed from that originally reported in a hereditary type of colorectal carcinoma. The observation suggests that this phenomenon is not a mechanism specific to neoplastic processes in breast carcinoma.\n",

The relationships between these allelic losses and the clinicopathological features were investigated.\n\n## RESULTS\nThe lymph node status was significantly associated with the allelic status of 17p, 18q and 22q. The tumor site and tumor differentiation were significantly associated with the allelic status of 18q. When patients with more than two allelic losses were defined as the high allelic loss group and those with no, or only one allelic loss were defined as the low allelic loss group, it was found that the lymph node involvement was significantly higher in the high than in the low allelic loss group. Only three out of 25 patients in the low allelic loss group had lymph node metastasis, and 15 patients in this group without lymphatic invasion had no lymph node metastasis. There was no relationship between the allelic status and survival at any stage.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nThe allelic status was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. A combination of allelic status and lymphatic invasion assessment can predict the lymph node status before radical surgery.\n",

Therapeutic effects in each mutational status were evaluated.\n\n## RESULTS\nThe incidences of KRAS mutations determined by direct sequencing and 2-step PCR RFLP were 34.4 and 52.5%, respectively (p = 0.02). Patients were categorized into 3 groups [W/W, wild-type by both methods (n = 29); W/M, wild-type by direct sequencing, detected mutation by 2-step PCR RFLP (n = 11); M/M, mutant-type by both methods (n = 21)]. The response rate for cetuximab in the W/M group (0%) was the same as that in the M/M group, and was significantly lower than in the W/W group (41.4%) (p < 0.001). Progression-free survival in the W/M group (11.0 weeks) was similar to that in the M/M group (8.0 weeks), and was significantly shorter than in the W/W group (18.0 weeks) (p < 0.002).\n\n## CONCLUSION\nHigh-sensitivity KRAS mutation testing is useful for selecting true responders to cetuximab.\n",

Although the number of adenomas appears to be dependent on the number of mutated MYH alleles present in a patient, little is known on the relation of this number with cancer risk. Four hundred fifty-three APC-negative patients with more than five colorectal adenomas were screened for mutations on the entire coding sequence of the MYH gene. Pathogenic mutations were initially found in 74 patients without extradigestive tumors (22.5%) and subsequently in 75 at-risk relatives. Polyposis was more severe in cases with biallelic mutations. However, mutation copy number was correlated neither with the age at diagnosis of adenomas or adenocarcinomas, nor with the presence of a family history of colorectal tumors. Heterozygous and homozygous MYH mutation carriers were both at high risk for synchronous cancers (24% in colorectum and 16% in the upper gastrointestinal tract), but did not demonstrate an increased risk for extradigestive tumors. MYH-associated polyposis is a frequent inherited colorectal cancer predisposition with a strong dominance component. From age 25-30, MYH mutation carriers should be proposed an early screening program, which includes endoscopies of the upper digestive tract and the colorectum every 2 years.\n",

The exact magnitude of the risk is not clearly defined. Current surveillance programmes use dysplasia as a marker for the risk of invasive carcinoma development, but this strategy has inherent limitations. A number of new molecular markers have been investigated but none are currently considered robust enough for routine clinical use. Recommendations for patient selection and interval for colonoscopic surveillance are currently pragmatic, and not entirely evidence-based. Nevertheless, optimal medical management and adherence to a surveillance programme geared to detect dysplasia might still be the best risk reduction strategy.\n",

Here, we report a mutant allele of MRE11 found in a colon cancer cell line that sensitizes cells to agents causing replication fork stress. The mutant Mre11 weakly interacts with Rad50 relative to wild type and shows little affinity for Nbs1. The mutant protein lacks 3'-5' exonuclease activity as a result of loss of part of the conserved nuclease domain; however, it retains binding affinity for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA with a 3' single-strand overhang, and fork-like structures containing ssDNA regions. In cells, the mutant protein shows a time- and dose-dependent accumulation in chromatin after thymidine treatment that corresponds with increased recruitment and hyperphosphorylation of replication protein A. ATM autophosphorylation, Mre11 foci, and thymidine-induced homologous recombination are suppressed in cells expressing the mutant allele. Together, our results suggest that the mutant Mre11 suppresses the cellular response to replication stress by binding to ssDNA regions at disrupted forks and impeding replication restart in a dominant negative manner.\n",

Adopting this approach to identify low-penetrance susceptibility alleles for colorectal cancer (CRC) we analysed genotype data from 9109 gene-centric SNPs, 7014 of which were non-synonymous (nsSNPs), in 2873 cases and 2871 controls using Illumina iselect arrays. Overall the distribution of associations was not significantly different from the null. No SNP achieved globally significant association after correction for multiple testing (lowest P value 1.7 x 10(-4), rs727299). We then analysed the dataset incorporating information on the functional consequences of nsSNPs. We used results from the in silico algorithm PolyPhen as prior information to weight the association statistics, with weights estimated from the observed test statistics within predefined groups of SNPs. Incorporating this information did not, however, yield any further evidence of a specific association (lowest P value 2.2 x 10(-4), rs1133950). There was a strong relationship between effect size and SNPs predicted to be damaging (P=1.63 x 10(-5)), however, these variants which are most likely to impact on risk are rare (MAF<5%). Hence although the rationale for searching for low-penetrance cancer susceptibly alleles by conducting genome-wide scans of coding changes is strong, in practice it is likely that natural selection has rendered such alleles to be too rare to be detected by association studies of the size employed.\n",

                "text": "Antibody to ras proteins in patients with colon cancer.\n\nThe current study examined sera from 160 colon cancer patients and 60 normal individuals to determine whether antibody to mutated p21 ras protein was present. Studies focused on the aspartic acid substitution at amino acid position 12 (denoted D12), one of the most common mutations in colon adenocarcinoma. IgA antibodies directed against mutated p21 ras-D12 protein were detected in 51 (32%) of 160 colon cancer patients, but only in 1 (2.5%) of 40 normal individuals. The greater incidence of antibody in cancer patients provides presumptive evidence that immunization to the ras proteins occurred as a result of the malignancy. Examination of sera for antibody reactivity to wild-type p21 ras protein (denoted p21 ras-G12) as well as p21 ras proteins bearing the D12, V12, S12, or L61 mutations showed that antibody detected was largely to normal segments of the p21 ras protein. Epitope mapping, using peptide neutralization assays with mutated or normal ras peptides as competitors, demonstrated that in 10 (67%) of 15 sera examined the antibody reactivity to p21 ras-G12 protein was neutralized by peptides near the carboxyl terminus of p21 ras protein, but not by peptides spanning the specific point mutation region. Antibody reactivities correlated with peripheral blood lymphocyte count, but did not correlate with patient age, sex, histology, stage, tumor locus, lymph node metastasis, or serum carcinoembryonic antigen.\n",

                "text": "The role of cytokine gene polymorphisms in colorectal cancer and their interaction with aspirin use in the northeast of Scotland.\n\nThe reduced risk of colorectal cancer associated with cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitors, such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, strongly suggests that chronic inflammation is a key mediator in the development of colorectal cancer. This complements recent molecular evidence demonstrating an association between a number of proinflammatory genetic polymorphisms and risk of colorectal cancer. We assessed polymorphisms in the IL-1, IL-10, TNF-A, and TGF-B genes in a population-based case-control study of colorectal cancer cases (n = 264) and frequency-matched controls (n = 408) in the Northeast of Scotland and analyzed their interaction with regular aspirin use. There was no evidence of a relation between any of the individual polymorphisms, or pairs of polymorphisms, and risk of colorectal cancer. There was a significant interaction between the IL-10-592 C/A polymorphism and aspirin use (Pinteraction = 0.03). Carriers of the variant IL-10-592 (A) allele, who produce less of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, had a statistically significant 50% reduced risk of colorectal cancer when taking regular aspirin (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.97), whereas risk was not reduced in carriers of the A allele who did not use aspirin, or among aspirin users with the CC genotype. It is possible that carriers of the mutant IL-10-592 allele are more likely to derive anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive benefits from aspirin in the presence of a lower production of their own endogenous anti-inflammatory interleukin-10. These results suggest that host genetics may play a role in predicting response to chemopreventive strategies. Confirmation of these findings in other populations is required.\n",

Two of the most important syndromes associated with a hereditary risk of cancer in women are hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, resulting from the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, caused primarily by the MLH1 and MSH2 genes. As testing for the hereditary risk of breast, ovarian, endometrial and colorectal cancer enters the clinical mainstream, physicians responsible for the health care of women are increasingly required to assess and provide guidance to healthy patients with a strong family history, cancer survivors who may be at risk of a second cancer and women who discover that a family member carries a specific mutation identified through genetic testing. Obstetricians and gynaecologists must therefore become familiar with the principles of assessing the family history for specific hereditary cancer syndromes, with the appropriate use of tests to confirm such syndromes and with the management options for women who have inherited a greatly increased risk of cancer.\n",

                "text": "Numerical abnormalities of chromosomes 17 and 18 in sporadic colorectal cancer: Incidence and correlation with clinical and biological findings and the prognosis of the disease.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\nIn recent years important information has accumulated on the genetic alterations present in colorectal tumors. However, thus far few studies have analyzed the impact of numerical abnormalities of chromosomes 17 and 18, which carry the p53 and DCC plus SHAD4/DPC4 genes involved in colorectal cancer, on the clinical and biological behaviors of the disease.\n\n## METHODS\nWith the use of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we analyzed the incidence of numerical abnormalities of chromosomes 17 and 18 in a series of malignant colorectal tumors and explored its potential association with clinicobiological behavior and the prognosis of the disease. For this purpose, 94 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with colorectal cancer were analyzed. In all cases, FISH analyses of the number of copies and nuclei of chromosomes 17 and 18 were performed in interphase nuclei with the use of double stainings. For all patients, information on age, sex, tumor size, Dukes' stage, tumor localization, DNA ploidy status, and the proportion of S-phase tumor cells was recorded. Median follow-up was 38 months.\n\n## RESULTS\nNumerical abnormalities of chromosomes 17 and 18 were present in most patients with colorectal cancer (57% and 52%, respectively). Gains of chromosome 17 and monosomy 18 were found in 51% and 29% of cases, respectively, and they were the most frequent individual abnormalities for each chromosome. The simultaneous analysis of the number of copies of both chromosomes in the same cell showed that, in most cases displaying numerical abnormalities for these chromosomes, two or more different tumor cell clones were present. From a clinical point of view, numerical abnormalities of chromosome 17, especially monosomy 17, were associated with a significantly higher incidence of rectal tumors (P = 0.001) and Dukes' stage D (P = 0.02) and a lower median of disease-free survival among patients who underwent curative surgery (P = 0.05), as compared with diploid cases. In addition, cases with an altered number of copies of chromosome 17 showed a higher incidence of DNA aneuploidy (P = 0.0001) and a greater proportion of S-phase cells (P = 0.001) by flow cytometry. In contrast, no clear association was found between the presence of numerical abnormalities of chromosome 18 and clinicobiological disease characteristics, except for a higher incidence of DNA aneuploidy by flow cytometry (P = 0.001) and a lower median of disease-free survival (P = 0.06). Multivariate analysis showed that numerical abnormalities of chromosome 17, but not of chromosome 18, are an independent prognostic factor for predicting disease-free survival in patients with colorectal cancer.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nNumerical abnormalities of chromosomes 17 and 18 were relatively common findings in patients with colorectal cancer, with chromosome 17 being associated with a higher incidence of tumors localized to the rectum and a worse clinical outcome.

                "text": "Mutations in two short noncoding mononucleotide repeats in most microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancers.\n\nDNA mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient cells typically accumulate mutations in short repetitive DNA tracts. This microsatellite instability (MSI) facilitates malignant transformation when affecting genes with growth-related and caretaker functions. To date, several putative MSI target genes have been proposed mainly based on high mutation frequency within their coding regions. However, some intronic repeat mutations have also been suggested to associate with MSI tumorigenesis, indicating the need for additional analyses on noncoding repeats. Here we have analyzed an intronic T9 repeat of semenogelin I (SEMG1) and report mutation frequencies of 51% (75 of 146) and 62% (8 of 13) in MMR-deficient primary colorectal cancers and cell lines, respectively. The putative effect of the SEMG1 mutations was assessed by RNA and protein level analyses, but no differences were detected between colorectal cancer cell lines with different SEMG1 status. Subsequently, the general background mutation frequency of MSI colorectal cancers was assessed by screening for intergenic T9 repeat alterations. One of 10 examined repeats was mutated in 70% (102 of 145) of the colorectal cancers evaluated. The frequencies observed here are notably higher than previously published in noncoding repeats shorter than 10 bp in MMR-deficient primary tumors. Our results indicate that high mutation frequencies, similar or higher than those observed in proposed and approved target genes, can be detected in repeat tracts of MSI tumors without any apparent selection pressure. These data call for urgent and thorough large-scale evaluation of mutation frequencies in neutral short repetitive sequences in MMR-deficient tumors.\n",

Using arbitrarily primed PCR fingerprinting of RNA (RAP-PCR), we have comparatively analyzed the overall gene expression patterns of several colorectal tumor cell lines with and without the MMP. A reproducible pattern of 30-40 main products was obtained for each fingerprint with a total of about 200 cell transcripts analyzed. Differences in RAP-PCR fingerprints were detected between these tumor cell lines. Some of these expression polymorphisms appeared to be specific for tumor cells of the MMP because they were present in two or more different MMP+ cell lines but absent in all MMP- cell lines analyzed. We also analyzed RNAs prepared from single cell clones isolated from these tumor cell lines. Reproducible differences in the fingerprints were detected between single cell clones from each of the cell lines analyzed. Examples of single cell clone-specific fingerprint differences from one of the MMP tumor cell lines were cloned and sequenced. Differential expression of some of these sequences was confirmed by Northern analysis using the cloned fragments as probes. Similar fingerprint alterations were also observed among single cell clones derived from single cell clones from mutator tumor cell lines, which appeared to exhibit higher clonal variation in gene expression compared with MMP- cells. The detection of inter- and intra-tumor alterations in gene expression by unbiased RAP-PCR show that these fluctuations occur with high frequency in tumor cells of the MMP. These results indicate that the profound genomic instability of tumor cells of the MMP is also reflected in a high incidence of alterations in their patterns of gene expression.\n",

We analyzed the mutational profiles of 12 known target genes containing polydeoxyadenosine repeats in their coding sequences in 39 MSI-H colorectal carcinomas and 40 MSI-H gastric carcinomas by using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, and compared the results with the clinicopathologic characteristics. Frameshift mutations of target genes in the MSI-H colorectal and gastric carcinomas are increased according to the length of the polydeoxyadenosine repeats in the target genes. The mean mutational rates of MSI-H colorectal carcinomas and MSI-H gastric carcinomas were 2.03 and 1.95 in the 4 genes containing (A)10 repeats, 1.23 and 0.73 in the 4 genes with (A)9 repeats and 0.61 and 0.48 in the 4 genes containing (A)8 repeats, respectively (p<0.001). Among the evaluated clinicopathologic findings, intestinal type gastric carcinomas had more frameshift mutations than the diffuse type carcinomas (3.5 vs. 1.9, p=0.01). These findings suggest that mutational rates of the target genes in MSI-H tumors are diverse, and higher mutational rates are related to the length of mononucleotide repeat sequences of the target genes and histologic type of tumors.\n",

We used a gene-targeting approach to evaluate p53-mediated death in human colorectal cancer cells. Expression of p53 in these cells induces growth arrest through transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. If p21 is disrupted via gene targeting, the cells die through apoptosis. If the PUMA gene is also disrupted in such cells, apoptosis is prevented. The effects of PUMA on apoptosis were observed after exogenous overexpression of p53 as well as after exposure to hypoxia, a physiologic activator of p53, and DNA damage. The PUMA protein interacts with Bcl-X(L) and promotes mitochondrial translocation and multimerization of Bax. Accordingly, genetic disruption of BAX makes cells resistant to the apoptosis resulting from PUMA expression. These results suggest that the balance between PUMA and p21 is pivotal in determining the responses to p53 activation and provide a model for understanding the basis of p53 mutations in human cancer.\n",

We recently reported that a promoter polymorphism in TS modified the risk of colorectal cancer as well as the survival rate after the disease. To explore whether TS may play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis early in the multistaged pathogenic pathway, we investigated the relation between the TS promoter polymorphism and risk of colorectal adenoma in a nested case-control study within the prospective Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We ascertained the TS genotype from 373 incident colorectal adenoma cases and 720 control subjects. Although there was no overall association between the TS promoter polymorphism and adenoma risk, we observed a significant TS-alcohol interaction (P for interaction = 0.009); relative to low alcohol consumers with the 2R/2R genotype, those with high alcohol consumption (>30 g/d) were not at elevated risk if they had the 2R/2R genotype [relative risk (RR), 0.80; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.34-1.90], but were at higher risk if they had the 2R/3R genotype (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.87-3.31), and at the highest risk (RR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.50-6.63) if they had the 3R/3R genotype. In addition, a significant interaction was observed between the TS promoter polymorphism and the 677C > T polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; P for interaction = 0.007). These findings lend additional support that one-carbon metabolism is an important process in pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.\n",

Using a two-compartmental model, quantitative parameters (K(trans) , kep , ve , and iAUC) were calculated from the whole-transverse region of interest (ROI) and high K(trans) area ROI of entire tumors. Histological specimens were analyzed for tumor size; T/N stage; lymphatic, vascular, perineural invasion; expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); and KRAS gene mutations. Tumor angiogenesis was evaluated based on the microvessel density (MVD) and the expression level of the vascular endothelial growth factor. Correlations of the DCE-MRI parameters with histological markers and angiogenesis were determined using Student's t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\n## RESULTS\nThe mean kep from high K(trans) area ROIs showed a significantly positive correlation with MVD (P\u2009 = \u20090.030, r\u2009 = \u20090.514, R(2) \u2009 = \u20090.264). The mean kep from the whole-transverse ROIs showed a significant inverse correlation with T stage (T1 vs. T2-4, P\u2009 = \u20090.021). EGFR-positive cancer displayed higher mean K(trans) (P\u2009 = \u20090.045) and kep (P\u2009 = \u20090.038) than EGFR-negative cancer in whole-transverse ROIs.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nThese preliminary results suggest that the determination of kep of high K(trans) area permits the noninvasive estimation of tumor angiogenesis in rectal cancer and that DCE-MRI parameters can be used as imaging biomarkers to predict the biologic aggressiveness of the tumor and patient prognosis.\n",

                "text": "The relationship of DNA aneuploidy to molecular genetic alterations in colorectal carcinoma.\n\nAltered total nuclear DNA content is frequent in colorectal carcinomas, but the mechanisms producing aneuploidy are unknown. Therefore, DNA ploidy by flow cytometry was correlated with molecular genetic alterations and tumor characteristics in 50 colorectal carcinomas. The prognostic value of these alterations was also evaluated because aneuploidy has been associated with poor prognosis. Thirty-nine of the carcinomas (78%) were DNA aneuploid. When compared with diploid carcinomas, aneuploid tumors had greater mean fractional allelic loss, defined as the fraction of evaluable nonacrocentric autosomal arms with deletion (0.25 +/- 0.15, range 0-0.667, vs. 0.12 +/- 0.10, range 0-0.345; P = 0.006). DNA index by flow cytometry correlated with fractional allelic loss (r = 0.38, P = 0.006). Aneuploid tumors also had more frequent allelic loss on chromosome 17p (87% vs. 55%; P = 0.017), but less frequent ras gene mutation (44% vs. 82%; P = 0.025). Among the 25 right-sided and 25 left-sided tumors, DNA diploid tumors were more frequent on the right side (P = 0.002), whereas deletion of 17p was found predominantly on the left side. Aneuploidy was associated with moderate and poor differentiation of the carcinomas but not with distant metastasis. By contrast, high fractional allelic loss, deletion of 17p, and deletion of 18q were associated with distant metastasis. In survival analysis of patients with Dukes' B or C carcinoma, DNA aneuploidy was not a significant discriminator, but patients whose tumor had deletion of 17p or deletion of both 17p and 18q had poorer survival (P = 0.045 and 0.022, respectively). The results suggest that DNA aneuploidy is associated with some of the molecular genetic alterations and phenotypic characteristics of colorectal carcinomas but is not a reliable indicator of metastatic potential.\n",

It is based on the Bayesian theorem and considers such parameters as fitness, age-specific expressivity of the gene and the effect of parental age on mutation rate. The definite expression of the risk estimation is proposed. Using hereditary polyposis as an example, possible risks are proposed. The table of risks, depending on the parental age, is given.\n",

Synchronous tumors may have a different biology and prognosis than solitary tumors. Evidence based on measurement of DNA ploidy suggests that a significant percentage of synchronous tumors have a common clonal origin, probably resulting from translumenal metastasis.\n\n## METHODS\nFifteen synchronous colorectal cancers (30 tumors) were examined for histologic differences as well as genetic mutations. p53 gene abnormalities were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Ki-ras mutations were detected by PCR followed by oligonucleotide-specific hybridization.\n\n## RESULTS\np53 gene mutations were detected in 12 of 30 tumors. In only one case was the same p53 mutation present in both tumors from one patient. Similarly, Ki-ras mutations were observed in 9 of 30 tumors. Concordant Ki-ras mutations were observed in only one case, which was also concordant for p53 mutation.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nBecause p53 and Ki-ras mutations tend to occur fairly early in tumor development, it seems likely that cases discordant for p53 and Ki-ras mutations represent independently developing tumor foci. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the great majority of synchronous colonic adenocarcinomas arise as independent neoplasms and their worsened prognosis is not a result of unusually early metastatic spread.\n",

Observed informativity was 83% for APC and 75% for DCC. DNA from 6 (20%) of 30 informative tumors exhibited loss of heterozygosity at the APC locus. Loss of heterozygosity at the DCC locus was observed in 7 (26%) of 27 informative tumor DNAs. Our results support the view that malignant progression is a consequence of more than one genetic change and suggest that inactivation of APC and DCC genes plays a role in a multistep process of colon tumor progression.\n",

Using eight polymorphic DNA markers on chromosome 8, we examined 120 primary hepatocellular carcinomas for abnormalities in the copy number of these loci in tumor cells. A 2- to 6-fold increase in intensities of bands representing single alleles was observed in 32 of the 78 tumors that were informative for one or more of the markers, indicating an increase in copy number (\"multiplication\") of alleles on 8q. The regions that multiplied varied from almost the entire long arm to a distal segment of chromosome 8, but a terminal region distal to 8q24.11 was multiplied in all 32 cases. Similar multiplications on 8q were detected in nine of 56 colorectal carcinomas that were informative for one or more of the markers. Our study demonstrated that polymorphic DNA markers can be used to detect numerical abnormalities of chromosomal material in solid tumors in which cytogenetic analysis is technically difficult.\n",

An HVP-InSiGHT Workshop was held on May 10, 2010, prior to the HVP Integration and Implementation Meeting at UNESCO in Paris, to review the progress of this pilot program. A wide range of topics were covered, including issues relating to genotype-phenotype data submission to the InSiGHT Colon Cancer Gene Variant Databases (chromium.liacs.nl/LOVD2/colon_cancer/home.php). The meeting also canvassed the recent exciting developments in models to evaluate the pathogenicity of unclassified variants using in silico data, tumor pathology information, and functional assays, and made further plans for the future progress and sustainability of the pilot program.\n",

To determine the mutation frequency of PIK3CA in pharyngeal cancer, we studied 24 additional cases of pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in this study. Using both direct genomic DNA sequencing and novel mutant-enriched sequencing methods developed specifically for the 3 hot-spot mutations (H1047R, E545K and E452K) of PIK3CA, we detected 5 mutations of PIK3CA in the 24 pharyngeal cancers (20.8%). Three of the 5 mutations had been missed by the conventional sequencing method and were subsequently detected by novel mutant-enriched sequencing methods. We showed that the mutant-enriched sequencing method for the H1047R hot-spot mutation can identify the mutation in a mixed population of mutant and wild-type DNA sequences at 1:360 ratios. These novel mutant-enriched sequencing methods allow the detection of the PIK3CA hot-spot mutations in clinical specimens which often contain limited tumor tissues (i.e., biopsy specimens). The data further support that oncogenic PIK3CA may play a critical role in pharyngeal carcinogenesis, and the mutant-enriched sequencing methods for PIK3CA are sensitive and reliable ways to detect PIK3CA mutations in clinical samples. Because PIK3CA and its pathway are potential targets for chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and frequent somatic mutation of PIK3CA has been identified in many human cancer types (e.g., breast cancer, colorectal cancer), the abilities to detect PIK3CA mutations with enhanced sensitivities have great potential impacts on target therapies for many cancer types.\n",

MSI analysis with five consensus markers and MMR protein staining for MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 were carried out in the tumours.\n\n## RESULTS\n25 pathogenic mutations (8 in MLH1, 9 in MSH2 and 8 in MSH6) were found. MSI analysis missed three and immunohistochemistry (IHC) missed two mutation carriers. Sensitivities of family history, MSI analysis and IHC for the presence of a mutation were 76%, 82% and 88%, specificities were 64%, 70% and 84%, and positive predictive values were 19%, 23% and 38%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed the highest odds ratio for IHC (38.3, 95% confidence interval 9.0 to 184). Prevalence of pathogenic germline MMR gene mutations in patients with CRC before the age of 50 years was 6% and in those with > or =2 HNPCC-associated tumours was 22%. In the second group, no mutation carriers were found among the 29 patients who were diagnosed with their first tumour after the age of 60 years.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nFamily history, MSI analysis and IHC are indicative parameters to select patients with CRC for MMR gene mutation analysis. The data show that IHC is the best single selection criterion.\n",

                "text": "Nutritional influences in selected gastrointestinal diseases.\n\nNutritional factors, as sources of luminal antigens, have been thought to be important factors in the immunopathogenesis of numerous gastrointestinal diseases. In some diseases, the role of the nutritional component is causal in the susceptible host. Such diseases include celiac disease, a common heritable chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine induced by dietary wheat, rye and barley, in susceptible individuals. Specific HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 risk alleles are necessary, but not sufficient, for disease development. The well-defined role of HLA-DQ heterodimers encoded by these alleles is to present cereal peptides to CD4+ T cells, activating an inflammatory immune response in the intestine. Genome-wide association studies have been performed which identified the IL2-IL21 risk locus and other genes with immune functions and key roles in thymic T-cell selection. Another example for this group is Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene, resulting in a defect of biliary copper excretion and toxic accumulation in the body, especially in the liver, brain and cornea, resulting in hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. In other diseases, however, the association is less well established. In such endeavor, epidemiological observations may become a valuable part of the overall investigations aimed at identifying dietary factors, which are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of the specific disease. As an example, relationships between nutrition and colorectal cancer have been hypothesized early on (e.g. folate, calcium, vitamin D, red meat). Similarly, intake of certain diet constituents like fat, refined sugar, fruits, vegetables and fiber was reported to be associated with the expression of inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, in children with active Crohn's disease, enteral nutrition was found to be equally effective as corticosteroids in induction of remission, with mucosal healing induced by downregulation of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in both the ileum and the colon after enteral nutrition. However, the particular effect of the consumption of each type of food remains questionable in most cases, at least in part because of insufficient data and serious methodological limitations (e.g. recall bias, heterogeneity between collected data, lack of correction for covariates, difficulties in double blinding).\n",

                "text": "Microsatellite instability is a predictive factor of the tumor response to irinotecan in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.\n\nThe aim of our study was to assess the relationship between colorectal tumor responsiveness to irinotecan and microsatellite instability (MSI), a feature of colorectal tumors with DNA mismatch repair defect. Seventy-two patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were included in our retrospective study. A complete response to irinotecan was observed in 1 patient and a partial response in 10 patients, whereas 61 patients did not respond to this treatment. We analyzed the protein expression of hMLH1, hMSH2, and BAX by immunohistochemistry, determined the MSI phenotype, and looked for mutations in the coding repeats located in the transforming growth factor beta-RII, BAX, hMSH3, and hMSH6 genes. All 44 tumors analyzed expressed detectable levels of hMLH1; 1 tumor lacked hMSH2 staining, whereas 4 tumors showed a marked decrease in BAX expression. A better response to irinotecan was observed in the patients whose tumors have lost BAX expression (P < 0.001). Among the 7 tumors that displayed a MSI-H phenotype, 4 responded to irinotecan, whereas only 7 of the 65 MSI-L/ microsatellite stable tumors did (P = 0.009). Seven of the 72 tumors had inactivating mutations in the coding repeats of the target genes. Three tumors displayed a mutation in the poly-A10 tract of the transforming growth factor beta-RII gene, associated with a 1-bp deletion in the poly-A8 tract of hMSH3 in one tumor and with a 1-bp deletion in the poly-G8 tract of BAX in another. Four tumors displayed mutations in the poly-G8 repeat of BAX, whereas 2 mutations in hMSH6 and hMSH3 were characterized. Among the 7 tumors with mutations in these target genes, 5 responded to irinotecan, whereas only 6 of the other 65 tumors did (P < 0.001), indicating that MSI-driven inactivation of target genes modifies tumor chemosensitivity. Our observations allowed us to define the first useful predictive criteria for irinotecan response in patients with colorectal cancer.\n",

Here, we report that the stable partial downregulation of the spindle checkpoint gene MAD1, which is observed in human cancer, leads to a functional inactivation of the spindle checkpoint resulting in gross aneuploidy. Interestingly, although Mad1 is thought to act as a kinetochore based activator of Mad2 during checkpoint activation, we show that normal levels of Mad2, but not of Mad1, are required for preventing premature sister chromatid separation and for maintaining the timing of an undisturbed mitosis, suggesting a Mad1 independent function of Mad2 that operates independent of its checkpoint function. Most significantly, a partial repression of either MAD1 or MAD2 confers resistance to nocodazole, a drug that inhibits microtubule attachment. In contrast, sensitivity to clinically relevant drugs like taxol or monastrol that inhibit the generation of tension across kinetochores is not modulated by partial downregulation of MAD1, suggesting a functional bifurcation of spindle checkpoint dependent apoptotic pathways.\n",

A systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\nMicrosatellite Instability (MSI) status is a good prognostic factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) but its predictive value for chemosensitivity remains controversial. A previous meta-analysis (MA) in the adjuvant setting showed that MSI-high (H) status did not predict the efficacy of chemotherapy. The predictive value of MSI status on the effect of metastatic chemotherapy was investigated by MA.\n\n## PATIENTS AND METHODS\nStudies were identified by electronic search through PubMed, Embase and ASCO proceedings online databases, using several key words (colorectal cancer, chemotherapy, microsatellite instability). For each study, the ratio of response rate (RR), complete (CR) and partial response (PR) divided by stable disease and progression was calculated. From 190 articles and 100 abstracts, only eight independent studies were selected. The data were analysed with a random-effect model (due to heterogeneity between studies) using EasyMA software. Statistical calculations were performed on six studies representing 964 patients (mean age 63 years; 91 MSI-H; 873 microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours). A total of 287 patients received 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapy, whereas 678 patients received combinations of 5FU or capecitabine with oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan.\n\n## RESULTS\nNo benefit of metastatic chemotherapy in terms of RR for MSI-H patients compared with MSS patients was found. The global hazard ratio (HR) for RR was 0.82 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.95; 0.65-1.03; p=0.09).\n\n## CONCLUSION\nMSI status does not predict the effect of chemotherapy which is similar in MSI-H and MSS metastatic CRC tumours.\n",

                "text": "[Colorectal oncogenesis].\n\nRecent progress in the field of molecular biology has allowed us to identify at least two different molecular mechanisms implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis (CRC): chromosomal instability (CIN) and genetic instability. Even though the two molecular mechanisms differ, their signalling pathways, implicated in malignant transformation of colonic epithelial cells, appear to be similar. The most frequent group of CRC, which represents 80% of sporadic CRC, is characterized by allelic losses on the short arm of chromosome 17 and 8 and on the long arm of chromosome 5, 18 and 22. These allelic losses are associated with mutations in TP53, APC, SMAD2 and SMAD4 genes. All of these alterations are grouped under the phenotype CIN. A\u00a0genetic instability termed MSI (microsatellite instability), which results from a mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency, appears in 12-15% of CRC cases. The presence of MMR deficiency leads to the accumulation of mutations in genes controlling cell cycle and apoptosis (TGFBRII, BAX or CASPASE5). More recently, the existence of a third phenotype was suggested. The main alteration associated with this group of tumors is the hypermethylation of the promoter region of numerous genes, leading to their inactivation. An activating mutation of BRAF is frequently associated with this phenotype. As described above, CRC shows genetic heterogeneity, however the consequences in terms of signalling pathway alterations are similar. For example, the activation of Wnt signalling pathways can result from the inactivation of the APC gene in the CIN phenotype or from an activating mutation in the \u03b2-catenin gene in MSI tumors. The inactivation of TGF\u03b2 pathways is also present in both tumor types and is driven by SMAD4, and more rarely by a SMAD2 inactivating mutation in CIN tumors, or by the existence of a frame-shift mutation occurring in a polyG coding track of the TGF\u03b2 (transforming growth factor) receptor type II in MSI tumors. The RAS-MAP kinase pathway is activated by KRAS mutations in CIN tumors or by BRAF mutations in MSI tumors. The p53 pathway is inactivated by TP53 inactivation in CIN tumors or by BAX inactivating mutations in MSI tumors.\n",

Accordingly, the present study analyzed 14 SNPs of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway genes and their impact on the prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer.\n\n## METHODS\n444 consecutive patients with surgically resected colorectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled in the present study. The genomic DNA was extracted from fresh colorectal tissue, and 14 polymorphisms of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway genes were determined using a real-time PCR genotyping assay.\n\n## RESULTS\nPathologic stages after surgery were as follows: stage 0/I (n = 85, 19.1%), stage II (n = 149, 33.6%), stage III (n = 147, 33.1%), and stage IV (n = 63, 14.2%). Univariate and multivariate survival analysis including stage, age, site of disease, adjuvant chemotherapy, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level showed that these polymorphisms were not associated with progression-free or overall survival. For the clinicopathologic parameters, CEA level and TNM stage were significant prognostic factors in a Cox model for survival.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nNone of the 14 SNPs of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway genes investigated in this study was found to be an independent prognostic marker for Korean patients with surgically resected colorectal cancer.\n",

                "text": "Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 1 in sporadic colorectal carcinoma.\n\n\n## AIM\nLoss of heterozygosity (LOH) on tumor suppressor genes is believed to play a key role in carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer. When it occurs at a tumor suppressor gene locus with abnormal allele, neoplastic transformation happens. In this study, we analyzed the LOH at 21 loci on chromosome 1 in sporadic colorectal cancer to identify additional loci involved in colorectal tumorigenesis.\n\n## METHODS\nTwenty-one polymorphic micro-satellite DNA markers were analyzed with PCR both in 83 cases of colorectal cancer and in normal tissues. PCR products were eletrophoresed on an ABI 377 DNA sequencer. Genescan 3.1 and Genotype 2.1 software were used for LOH scanning and analysis. chi2 test was used to compare LOH frequency with clinicopathological data. P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\n\n## RESULTS\nThe average LOH frequency of chromosome 1, short arm and long arm was 19.83%, 18.00% and 21.66%, respectively. The 2 highest LOH loci with a frequency of 36.54% and 32.50% were identified on D1S468 (1p36.33-p36.31) and D1S413 (1q31.3), respectively. On D1S2726 locus, LOH frequency of rectal cancer was 28.57% (6/21), which was higher than that of colon cancer (0.00%, 0/33) (P=0.002), suggesting that the mechanism of carcinogenesis was different in both groups.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nPutative tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 1 may relate to sporadic colorectal carcinomas. Tumor-suppressor-genes might locate on 1p36.33-36.31 and/or 1q31.3.\n",

                "text": "A genetic variant in microRNA target site of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway increases the risk of colorectal cancer in a Chinese population.\n\nEvidence shows that single-nucleotide polymorphisms in microRNA (miRNA) target sites can create, destroy, or modify the miRNA/mRNA binding, therefore modulating gene expression and affecting cancer susceptibility. The transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in tumor initiation and progression. Intriguingly, recent advances of genome-wide association studies have identified multiple risk loci in this pathway to be associated with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). To test the hypothesis that genetic variants in miRNA target sites in genes of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway may also be associated with CRC risk, we first systematically scanned the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway which potentially affect the miRNA/mRNA bindings. Through a series of filters, we narrowed down these candidates to four SNPs. Then, we conducted a case-control study with 600 CRC patients and 638 controls in Han Chinese population. We observed that compared with A carriers (AA\u2009+\u2009AG), the GG genotype of rs12997:ACVR1 is associated with a significantly higher risk of CRC (OR\u2009=\u20091.52, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)\u2009=\u20091.04-2.21, P\u2009=\u20090.031), particularly in nonsmokers with a higher OR of 1.63 (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.04-2.55, P\u2009=\u20090.032). Our study suggested that SNPs in miRNA target sites could contribute to the likelihood of CRC susceptibility and emphasized the important role of polymorphisms at miRNA-regulatory elements in carcinogenesis.\n",

                "text": "Evolutionarily conserved protein ERH controls CENP-E mRNA splicing and is required for the survival of KRAS mutant cancer cells.\n\nCancers with Ras mutations represent a major therapeutic problem. Recent RNAi screens have uncovered multiple nononcogene addiction pathways that are necessary for the survival of Ras mutant cells. Here, we identify the evolutionarily conserved gene enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH), in which depletion causes greater toxicity in cancer cells with mutations in the small GTPase KRAS compared with KRAS WT cells. ERH interacts with the spliceosome protein SNRPD3 and is required for the mRNA splicing of the mitotic motor protein CENP-E. Loss of ERH leads to loss of CENP-E and consequently, chromosome congression defects. Gene expression profiling indicates that ERH is required for the expression of multiple cell cycle genes, and the gene expression signature resulting from ERH down-regulation inversely correlates with KRAS signatures. Clinically, tumor ERH expression is inversely associated with survival of colorectal cancer patients whose tumors harbor KRAS mutations. Together, these findings identify a role of ERH in mRNA splicing and mitosis, and they provide evidence that KRAS mutant cancer cells are dependent on ERH for their survival.\n",

Of 48 individuals offered predictive genetic testing, 41 (85%) responded and 39 (81%) underwent testing. Seven of the 39 (18%) were positive for the family-specific mutation, and 32 (82%) were negative. The 39 tested individuals and 37 of their descendants who were registered with the screening program had undergone 70 colonoscopies in the five years before genetic testing. In the five years after testing, only 37 surveillance colonoscopies were planned (annual or two-yearly colonoscopies for the six mutation-positive individuals and five-yearly colonoscopies for four mutation-negative individuals with previously identified adenoma), an almost 50% reduction in colonoscopies.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nPredictive genetic testing in HNPCC families allows many individuals to be withdrawn from regular colonoscopic surveillance. It may therefore reduce costs, as well as have emotional benefits for many individuals.\n",

The presence and behaviors of distinct neoplastic cell populations within a patient's tumor may underlie multiple clinical phenotypes in cancers. A goal of many current cancer genome studies is the identification of recurring selected driver events that can be advanced for the development of personalized therapies. Unfortunately, in the majority of rare tumors, this type of analysis can be particularly challenging. Large series of specimens for analysis are simply not available, allowing recurring patterns to remain hidden. In this paper, we highlight the use of DNA content-based flow sorting to identify and isolate DNA-diploid and DNA-aneuploid populations from tumor biopsies as a strategy to comprehensively study the genomic composition and behaviors of individual cancers in a series of rare solid tumors: intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, anal carcinoma, adrenal leiomyosarcoma, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. We propose that the identification of highly selected genomic events in distinct tumor populations within each tumor can identify candidate driver events that can facilitate the development of novel, personalized treatment strategies for patients with cancer.\n",

                "text": "MiRNA genes constitute new targets for microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer.\n\nMismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers (CRC) display widespread instability at DNA microsatellite sequences (MSI). Although MSI has been reported to commonly occur at coding repeats, leading to alterations in the function of a number of genes encoding cancer-related proteins, nothing is known about the putative impact of this process on non-coding microRNAs. In miRbase V15, we identified very few human microRNA genes with mono- or di-nucleotide repeats (n = 27). A mutational analysis of these sequences in a large series of MSI CRC cell lines and primary tumors underscored instability in 15 of the 24 microRNA genes successfully studied at variable frequencies ranging from 2.5% to 100%. Following a maximum likelihood statistical method, microRNA genes were separated into two groups that differed significantly in their mutation frequencies and in their tendency to represent mutations that may or may not be under selective pressures during MSI tumoral progression. The first group included 21 genes that displayed no or few mutations in CRC. The second group contained three genes, i.e., hsa-mir-1273c, hsa-mir-1303 and hsa-mir-567, with frequent (\u2265 80%) and sometimes bi-allelic mutations in MSI tumors. For the only one expressed in colonic tissues, hsa-mir-1303, no direct link was found between the presence or not of mono- or bi-allelic alterations and the levels of mature miR expression in MSI cell lines, as determined by sequencing and quantitative PCR respectively. Overall, our results provide evidence that DNA repeats contained in human miRNA genes are relatively rare and preserved from mutations due to MSI in MMR-deficient cancer cells. Functional studies are now required to conclude whether mutated miRNAs, and especially the miR-1303, might have a role in MSI tumorigenesis.\n",

                "text": "Mutational analysis of the transforming growth factor beta receptor type II gene in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and early-onset colorectal cancer patients.\n\nSomatic mutations in the transforming growth factor beta receptor type II (TGF-beta RII) gene have been observed in various human cancers showing microsatellite instability. Most of the mutations observed were additions or deletions of the mononucleotide repeat sequence present in TGF-beta RII coding region, suggesting that the TGF-beta RII may be a target gene of genomic instability in tumorigenesis. Recently, we reported germ-line frameshift mutations in the mononucleotide repeat sequence of the hMSH6 gene, which is believed to be one of the target genes of genomic instability in tumorigenesis, suggesting the possibility of germ-line mutation in mononucleotide repeat sequences. Moreover, one case of germ-line mutation in the TGF-beta RII gene was identified in a hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) kindred, indicating the involvement of TGF-beta RII inactivation in tumorigenesis of HNPCC. However, germ-line mutation analysis of all of the coding sequences and the mononucleotide repeat sequence of the TGF-beta RII in HNPCC patients has not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, to further investigate the presence of germ-line mutations, we screened all of the coding region sequences and mononucleotide repeat sequence of TGF-beta RII from 35 HNPCC, 44 suspected HNPCC, and 45 sporadic early-onset colorectal cancer patients. However, no pathogenic mutations other than silent mutations, introgenic mutation, and polymorphisms were identified. Two silent mutations at codons 309 (ACG to ACA) and 340 (CAT to CAC) in the kinase domain located in exon 4 were detected. A 1-bp cytidine deletion was observed 6 bases from the 3' end of intron. Two polymorphisms were identified at codon 389 (AAC to AAT) and at the fourth-to-last base in intron 3. The polymorphism at codon 389 was more frequent in HNPCC (20%; 7 of 35) and suspected HNPCC patients (18%; 8 of 44) than in nonmalignant control group (10%; 5 of 50). Moreover, the frequency was significantly higher in early-onset colorectal cancer patients (31%; 14 of 45). This is the first report of a different frequency of polymorphism in HNPCC, suspected HNPCC, early-onset colorectal cancer patients, and healthy normal individuals. This result suggests that: (a) germ-line mutation of the TGF-beta RII gene may be a rare event during tumorigenesis in HNPCC and sporadic early-onset colorectal cancer; (b) the mononucleotide repeat sequence of the TGF-beta RII gene is an apparent target of genomic instability but not of germ-line mutation; and (c) the polymorphism of codon 389 (AAC to AAT) is frequent, especially in early-onset colorectal cancer patients, in which it is more frequent than in control group.\n",

The actual modeling and simulation of the key biological structures involved in this process is of interest to biologists and physicians and, at the same time, it poses significant challenges from the mathematics and computer science viewpoints. In this report we give an overview of some mathematical models for cell sorting (a basic phenomenon that underlies several dynamical processes in an organism), intestinal crypt dynamics and related problems and open questions. In particular, major attention is devoted to the survey of so-called in-lattice (or grid) models and off-lattice (off-grid) models. The current work is the groundwork for future research on semi-automated hypotheses formation and testing about the behavior of the various actors taking part in the adenoma-carcinoma progression, from regulatory processes to cell-cell signaling pathways.\n",

Many of these risk factors are associated with affluent Western societies. More than 95% of colorectal cancers are sporadic, arising in individuals without a significant hereditary risk. Geographic variation in the incidence of colorectal cancer is considerable with a higher incidence observed in the West. Environmental factors contribute substantially to this variation. A number of these risk factors are associated with a Western lifestyle and could be considered a product of 'civilization'. Recently, smoking has been recognized as a risk factor. Energy consumption also influences colorectal cancer risk, with obesity increasing risk and exercise reducing risk. However, the strongest contribution to environmental risk for colorectal cancer is dietary. Consumption of fat, alcohol and red meat is associated with an increased risk. Fresh fruit and vegetables and dietary fibre may be protective. Much has been learnt recently about the molecular pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer always arises in the context of genomic instability. There is inactivation of the tumour suppressor genes adenomatous polyposis coli, p53, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, activation of oncogene pathways including K-ras, and activation of the cyclooxygenase-2, epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor pathways. The mechanisms by which some environmental factors modify the mutation risk in these pathways have been described.\n",

MicroRNAs are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets and agents, but limited information on microRNAome alterations during progression in the well-known adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence is available to guide their usage.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nWe profiled 866 human microRNAs by microarray analysis in 69 matched specimens of microsatellite-stable adenocarcinomas, adjoining precursor adenomas including areas of high- and low-grade dysplasia, and nonneoplastic mucosa.\n\n## RESULTS\nWe found 230 microRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed during progression, including 19 not reported previously. Altered microRNAs clustered into two major patterns of early (type I) and late (type II) differential expression. The largest number (n = 108) was altered at the earliest step from mucosa to low-grade dysplasia (subtype IA) prior to major nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin, including 36 microRNAs that had persistent differential expression throughout the entire sequence to adenocarcinoma. Twenty microRNAs were intermittently altered (subtype IB), and six were transiently altered (subtype IC). In contrast, 33 microRNAs were altered late in high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma (subtype IIA), and 63 in adenocarcinoma only (subtype IIB). Predicted targets in 12 molecular pathways were identified for highly altered microRNAs, including the Wnt signaling pathway leading to low-grade dysplasia. \u03b2-catenin expression correlated with downregulated microRNAs.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur findings suggest that numerous microRNAs play roles in the sequence of molecular events, especially early events, resulting in colorectal adenocarcinoma. The temporal patterns and complexity of microRNAome alterations during progression will influence the efficacy of microRNAs for clinical purposes.\n",

Endoscopic screening is now in favor and its use is increasing, but overall participation rates are poor. A substantial percentage of the population will likely continue to resist endoscopic screening. As such, a noninvasive biomarker for the early detection of CRC remains a priority. Herein, we (i) review the currently available noninvasive screening markers for the early detection of CRC, (ii) discuss newer markers that have undergone preliminary testing, and (iii) introduce and explain potentially promising markers of the future.\n\n## METHODS\nThe published literature on markers for early detection of CRC was identified using a MEDLINE/PubMed search with secondary review of cited publications.\n\n## RESULTS\nNoninvasive testing for CRC is most advanced in testing for stool fecal occult blood, globin, or DNA mutations. Study of abnormal mucins has also been explored. Research for serum-based markers is just beginning and includes serum proteomics, nuclear matrix proteins, and serum DNA testing.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nSerial guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is simple, inexpensive, and proven effective at reducing mortality from CRC. Immunochemical fecal occult blood tests facilitate compliance and offer improved specificity, but at increased cost in comparison to FOBT. Fecal DNA testing may provide enhanced sensitivity for detection of CRC in comparison with FOBT, but its high cost limits its use for generalized screening. Rectal mucin testing requires additional evaluation to determine its sensitivity and specificity in comparison with guaiac-based FOBT. Serum tests, such as proteomics, nuclear matrix proteins, and serum DNA, are still in their infancy, but remain a hope for the future.\n",
