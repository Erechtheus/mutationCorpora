                "text": "An exponential combination procedure for set-based association tests in sequencing studies. State-of-the-art next-generation-sequencing technologies can facilitate in-depth explorations of the human genome by investigating both common and rare variants. For the identification of genetic factors that are associated with disease risk or other complex phenotypes, methods have been proposed for jointly analyzing variants in a set (e.g., all coding SNPs in a gene). Variants in a properly defined set could be associated with risk or phenotype in a concerted fashion, and by accumulating information from them, one can improve power to detect genetic risk factors. Many set-based methods in the literature are based on statistics that can be written as the summation of variant statistics. Here, we propose taking the summation of the exponential of variant statistics as the set summary for association testing. From both Bayesian and frequentist perspectives, we provide theoretical justification for taking the sum of the exponential of variant statistics because it is particularly powerful for sparse alternatives-that is, compared with the large number of variants being tested in a set, only relatively few variants are associated with disease risk-a distinctive feature of genetic data. We applied the exponential combination gene-based test to a sequencing study in anticancer pharmacogenomics and uncovered mechanistic insights into genes and pathways related to chemotherapeutic susceptibility for an important class of oncologic drugs.",

                "text": "Hereditary leukonychia, or porcelain nails, resulting from mutations in PLCD1. Hereditary leukonychia (porcelain nails or white nails) is a rare nail disorder with an unknown genetic basis. To identify variants in a gene underlying this phenotype, we identified four families of Pakistani origin showing features of hereditary leukonychia. All 20 nails of each affected individual were chalky and white in appearance, consistent with total leukonychia, with no other cutaneous, appendageal, or systemic findings. By using Affymetrix 10K chip, we established linkage to chromosome 3p21.3-p22 with a LOD score (Z) of 5.1. We identified pathogenic mutations in PLCD1 in all four families, which encodes phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C delta 1 subunit, a key enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism. We then identified localization of PLCD1 in the nail matrix. It was recently shown that PLCD1 is a component of the human nail plate by proteomic analysis and is localized in the matrix of human nails. Furthermore, mutations detected in PLCD1 resulted in reduced enzymatic activity in\u00a0vitro. Our data show that mutations in PLCD1 underlie hereditary leukonychia, revealing a gene involved in molecular control of nail growth.",

Segmental duplications, which comprise approximately 5%-10% of the human genome, are known to mediate medically relevant deletions, duplications, and inversions through nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and have been suggested to be hot spots in chromosome evolution and human genomic instability. We report seven individuals with microdeletions at 17q23.1q23.2, identified by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Six of the seven deletions are approximately 2.2 Mb in size and flanked by large segmental duplications of >98% sequence identity and in the same orientation. One of the deletions is approximately 2.8 Mb in size and is flanked on the distal side by a segmental duplication, whereas the proximal breakpoint falls between segmental duplications. These characteristics suggest that NAHR mediated six out of seven of these rearrangements. These individuals have common features, including mild to moderate developmental delay (particularly speech delay), microcephaly, postnatal growth retardation, heart defects, and hand, foot, and limb abnormalities. Although all individuals had at least mild dysmorphic facial features, there was no characteristic constellation of features that would elicit clinical suspicion of a specific disorder. The identification of common clinical features suggests that microdeletions at 17q23.1q23.2 constitute a novel syndrome. Furthermore, the inclusion in the minimal deletion region of TBX2 and TBX4, transcription factors belonging to a family of genes implicated in a variety of developmental pathways including those of heart and limb, suggests that these genes may play an important role in the phenotype of this emerging syndrome.",

Individuals with severe, sporadic disorders of infantile onset represent an important class of disease for which discovery of the underlying genetic architecture is not amenable to traditional genetic analysis. Full-genome sequencing of affected individuals and their parents provides a powerful alternative strategy for gene discovery. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on a family quartet containing an affected proband and her unaffected parents and sibling. The 15-year-old female proband had a severe epileptic encephalopathy consisting of early-onset seizures, features of autism, intellectual disability, ataxia, and sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. We discovered a de novo heterozygous missense mutation (c.5302A>G [p.Asn1768Asp]) in the voltage-gated sodium-channel gene SCN8A in the proband. This mutation alters an evolutionarily conserved residue in Nav1.6, one of the most abundant sodium channels in the brain. Analysis of the biophysical properties of the mutant channel demonstrated a dramatic increase in persistent sodium current, incomplete channel inactivation, and a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state fast inactivation. Current-clamp analysis in hippocampal neurons transfected with p.Asn1768Asp channels revealed increased spontaneous firing, paroxysmal-depolarizing-shift-like complexes, and an increased firing frequency, consistent with a dominant gain-of-function phenotype in the heterozygous proband. This work identifies SCN8A as the fifth sodium-channel gene to be mutated in epilepsy and demonstrates the value of WGS for the identification of pathogenic mutations causing severe, sporadic neurological disorders.",

Mutations in the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene are responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), which is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, profound hypogammaglobulinemia, and decreased numbers of mature B cells in the peripheral blood. We evaluated 17 male Brazilian patients from 13 unrelated families who showed markedly reduced numbers of blood B cells and hypogammaglobulinemia. BTK gene analysis detected mutations in 10 of the 13 presumed XLA families. Seven mutations (Q196X, G613D, R28L, 251-273del, Q234X, H364P, and R13X) had been reported previously, whereas the remaining three mutations (M501T, IVS15+1G>C, and IVS14+1G>A) were novel. Mutation IVS15+1G>C occurred in a splice donor site and caused exons 15 and 16 to be skipped, and IVS14+1G>A might cause exon 14 to be skipped. Flow cytometry revealed deficient expression of BTK protein in 10 of the 13 families. This is the first report of the diagnosis of XLA by analysis of mutations of the BTK gene in Brazilian patients.",

Excessive growth of terminal hair around the elbows (hypertrichosis cubiti) has been reported both in isolation and in association with a variable spectrum of associated phenotypic features. We identified a cohort of six individuals with hypertrichosis cubiti associated with short stature, intellectual disability, and a distinctive facial appearance, consistent with a diagnosis of Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS). Utilizing a whole-exome sequencing approach, we identified de novo mutations in MLL in five of the six individuals. MLL encodes a histone methyltransferase that regulates chromatin-mediated transcription through the catalysis of methylation of histone H3K4. Each of the five mutations is predicted to result in premature termination of the protein product. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transcripts arising from the mutant alleles are subject to nonsense-mediated decay. These findings define the genetic basis of WSS, provide additional evidence for the role of haploinsufficency of histone-modification enzymes in multiple-congenital-anomaly syndromes, and further illustrate the importance of the regulation of histone modification in development.",

                "text": "Identification of a novel gene and a common variant associated with uric acid nephrolithiasis in a Sardinian genetic isolate. Uric acid nephrolithiasis (UAN) is a common disease with an established genetic component that presents a complex mode of inheritance. While studying an ancient founder population in Talana, a village in Sardinia, we recently identified a susceptibility locus of approximately 2.5 cM for UAN on 10q21-q22 in a relatively small sample that was carefully selected through genealogical information. To refine the critical region and to identify the susceptibility gene, we extended our analysis to severely affected subjects from the same village. We confirm the involvement of this region in UAN through identical-by-descent sharing and autozygosity mapping, and we refine the critical region to an interval of approximately 67 kb associated with UAN by linkage-disequilibrium mapping. After inspecting the genomic sequences available in public databases, we determined that a novel gene overlaps this interval. This gene is divided into 15 exons, spanning a region of approximately 300 kb and generating at least four different proteins (407, 333, 462, and 216 amino acids). Interestingly, the last isoform was completely included in the 67-kb associated interval. Computer-assisted analysis of this isoform revealed at least one membrane-spanning domain and several N- and O-glycosylation consensus sites at N-termini, suggesting that it could be an integral membrane protein. Mutational analysis shows that a coding nucleotide variant (Ala62Thr), causing a missense in exon 12, is in strong association with UAN (P=.0051). Moreover, Ala62Thr modifies predicted protein secondary structure, suggesting that it may have a role in UAN etiology. The present study underscores the value of our small, genealogically well-characterized, isolated population as a model for the identification of susceptibility genes underlying complex diseases. Indeed, using a relatively small sample of affected and unaffected subjects, we identified a candidate gene for multifactorial UAN.",

                "text": "Statistical evaluation of multiple-locus linkage data in experimental species and its relevance to human studies: application to nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse and human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Common, familial human disorders generally do not follow Mendelian inheritance patterns, presumably because multiple loci are involved in disease susceptibility. One approach to mapping genes for such traits in humans is to first study an analogous form in an animal model, such as mouse, by using inbred strains and backcross experiments. Here we describe methodology for analyzing multiple-locus linkage data from such experimental backcrosses, particularly in light of multilocus genetic models, including the effects of epistasis. We illustrate these methods by using data from backcrosses involving nonobese diabetic mouse, which serves as an animal model for human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We show that it is likely that a minimum of nine loci contribute to susceptibility, with strong epistasis effects among these loci. Three of the loci actually confer a protective effect in the homozygote, compared with the heterozygote. Further, we discuss the relevance of these studies for analogous studies of the human form of the trait. Specifically, we show that the magnitude of the gene effect in the experimental backcross is likely to correlate only weakly, at best, with the expected magnitude of effect for a human form, because in humans the gene effect will depend more heavily on disease allele frequencies than on the observed penetrance ratios; such allele frequencies are unpredictable. Hence, the major benefit from animal studies may be a better understanding of the disease process itself, rather than identification of cells through comparison mapping in humans by using regions of homology.",

Telomeric chromosome rearrangements may cause mental retardation, congenital anomalies, and miscarriages. Automated detection of subtle deletions or duplications involving telomeres is essential for high-throughput diagnosis, but impossible when conventional cytogenetic methods are used. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) allows high-resolution screening of copy number abnormalities by hybridizing differentially labeled test and reference genomes to arrays of robotically spotted clones. To assess the applicability of this technique in the diagnosis of (sub)telomeric imbalances, we here describe a blinded study, in which DNA from 20 patients with known cytogenetic abnormalities involving one or more telomeres was hybridized to an array containing a validated set of human-chromosome-specific (sub)telomere probes. Single-copy-number gains and losses were accurately detected on these arrays, and an excellent concordance between the original cytogenetic diagnosis and the array-based CGH diagnosis was obtained by use of a single hybridization. In addition to the previously identified cytogenetic changes, array-based CGH revealed additional telomere rearrangements in 3 of the 20 patients studied. The robustness and simplicity of this array-based telomere copy-number screening make it highly suited for introduction into the clinic as a rapid and sensitive automated diagnostic procedure.",

In a BRCA1 screening in familial breast cancer carried out in different centres in Spain, France, and United Kingdom, a missense mutation 330A>G which results in a Arg to Gly change at codon 71 (R71G) was independently identified in 6 families, all of them with Spanish ancestors. This residue coincides with the -2 position of the exon 5 donor splice site. We further investigated the effect of this base substitution on the splicing of BRCA1 mRNA. The sequence analysis of the cDNA indicated that 22 bp of exon 5 were deleted, creating with the first bases of exon 6 a termination codon at position 64, which results in a truncated protein. The BRCA1 haplotype of the R71G carrier patients and Spanish controls was analysed by use of six microsatellites located within or near BRCA1. Our results are consistent with the possibility that these families shared a common ancestry with BRCA1 R71G being a founder mutation of Spanish origin.",

                "text": "Identification of a novel BBS gene (BBS12) highlights the major role of a vertebrate-specific branch of chaperonin-related proteins in Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is primarily an autosomal recessive ciliopathy characterized by progressive retinal degeneration, obesity, cognitive impairment, polydactyly, and kidney anomalies. The disorder is genetically heterogeneous, with 11 BBS genes identified to date, which account for ~70% of affected families. We have combined single-nucleotide-polymorphism array homozygosity mapping with in silico analysis to identify a new BBS gene, BBS12. Patients from two Gypsy families were homozygous and haploidentical in a 6-Mb region of chromosome 4q27. FLJ35630 was selected as a candidate gene, because it was predicted to encode a protein with similarity to members of the type II chaperonin superfamily, which includes BBS6 and BBS10. We found pathogenic mutations in both Gypsy families, as well as in 14 other families of various ethnic backgrounds, indicating that BBS12 accounts for approximately 5% of all BBS cases. BBS12 is vertebrate specific and, together with BBS6 and BBS10, defines a novel branch of the type II chaperonin superfamily. These three genes are characterized by unusually rapid evolution and are likely to perform ciliary functions specific to vertebrates that are important in the pathophysiology of the syndrome, and together they account for about one-third of the total BBS mutational load. Consistent with this notion, suppression of each family member in zebrafish yielded gastrulation-movement defects characteristic of other BBS morphants, whereas simultaneous suppression of all three members resulted in severely affected embryos, possibly hinting at partial functional redundancy within this protein family.",

Mutations in brief no. 217. Online. Hypophosphatasia is a rare inherited disorder characterized by defective bone mineralization and deficiency of serum and tissue liver/ bone/kidney tissue alkaline phosphatase (L/B/K ALP) activity. We report the characterization of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) gene mutations in a series of 9 families affected by severe hypophosphatasia. Fourteen distinct mutations were found, 3 of which were previously reported in the North American or Japanese populations. Seven of the 11 new mutations were missense mutations (M45L, R119H, G145V, C184Y and H154Y, D289V, E459K), the four others were 2 single nucleotide deletions (544delG and 1172delC), a mutation affecting donor splice site (862 + 5A) and a nonsense mutation (R411X).",

                "text": "Detection of hotspot mutations and polymorphisms using an enhanced PCR-RFLP approach. Ethidium gel-based PCR-RFLP is widely used, and is perhaps the simplest method for detection of known mutations in cancer-related genes and for genotyping a wide range of other human diseases. However, its application is limited by the fact that it can only detect mutant alleles that are present in more than 5-10% of wild-type alleles. Here we present a method that allows a 1-2 order enhancement in the sensitivity of the widely used PCR-RFLP without substantially increasing the effort and cost associated with it. This method is a modification to our previously reported amplification via primer ligation at the mutation (APRIL-ATM) method, which utilizes ligation of a primer at a restriction site formed by a mutation, followed by a ligation-mediated PCR amplification which amplifies only the mutation-containing DNA molecules. By combining this method with the artificial introduction of restriction sites during PCR, we demonstrate that assays can be designed and validated for detecting hot-spot mutations in codons 273, 158, and 248 of the TP53 gene (p53) and potentially for most mutations of interest. This approach is validated by using samples where the mutation was artificially introduced at these p53 positions. The increased sensitivity offered by the method further allows us to rapidly screen for low frequency polymorphisms in pooled DNA samples. The frequency of an MSH2 missense polymorphism (965G>A) was quantified in pooled genomic DNA samples from 205 and 221 U.S. and Polish colorectal cancer patients, respectively, and an equal number of ethnicity-matched controls. The data revealed a 3-5% prevalence of this polymorphism in the patient and the control populations. Individual sequencing of all 852 patient samples demonstrated an excellent agreement among the two independent approaches. The present enhanced PCR-RFLP reduces the effort involved in high throughput polymorphism studies and promises to find applications in genotyping and association studies involving low frequency polymorphisms and mutations.",

                "text": "Human and mouse mutations in WDR35 cause short-rib polydactyly syndromes due to abnormal ciliogenesis. Defects in cilia formation and function result in a range of human skeletal and visceral abnormalities. Mutations in several genes have been identified to cause a proportion of these disorders, some of which display genetic (locus) heterogeneity. Mouse models are valuable for dissecting the function of these genes, as well as for more detailed analysis of the underlying developmental defects. The short-rib polydactyly (SRP) group of disorders are among the most severe human phenotypes caused by cilia dysfunction. We mapped the disease locus from two siblings affected by a severe form of SRP to 2p24, where we identified an in-frame homozygous deletion of exon 5 in WDR35. We subsequently found compound heterozygous missense and nonsense mutations in WDR35 in an independent second case with a similar, severe SRP phenotype. In a mouse mutation screen for developmental phenotypes, we identified a mutation in Wdr35 as the cause of midgestation lethality, with abnormalities characteristic of defects in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. We show that endogenous WDR35 localizes to cilia and centrosomes throughout the developing embryo and that human and mouse fibroblasts lacking the protein fail to produce cilia. Through structural modeling, we show that WDR35 has strong homology to the COPI coatamers involved in vesicular trafficking and that human SRP mutations affect key structural elements in WDR35. Our report expands, and sheds new light on, the pathogenesis of the SRP spectrum of ciliopathies.",

                "text": "A phase 1/2 clinical trial of enzyme replacement in fabry disease: pharmacokinetic, substrate clearance, and safety studies. Fabry disease results from deficient alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) activity and the pathologic accumulation of the globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) and related glycosphingolipids, primarily in vascular endothelial lysosomes. Treatment is currently palliative, and affected patients generally die in their 40s or 50s. Preclinical studies of recombinant human alpha-Gal A (r-halphaGalA) infusions in knockout mice demonstrated reduction of GL-3 in tissues and plasma, providing rationale for a phase 1/2 clinical trial. Here, we report a single-center, open-label, dose-ranging study of r-halphaGalA treatment in 15 patients, each of whom received five infusions at one of five dose regimens. Intravenously administered r-halphaGalA was cleared from the circulation in a dose-dependent manner, via both saturable and non-saturable pathways. Rapid and marked reductions in plasma and tissue GL-3 were observed biochemically, histologically, and/or ultrastructurally. Clearance of plasma GL-3 was dose-dependent. In patients with pre- and posttreatment biopsies, mean GL-3 content decreased 84% in liver (n=13), was markedly reduced in kidney in four of five patients, and after five doses was modestly lowered in the endomyocardium of four of seven patients. GL-3 deposits were cleared to near normal or were markedly reduced in the vascular endothelium of liver, skin, heart, and kidney, on the basis of light- and electron-microscopic evaluation. In addition, patients reported less pain, increased ability to sweat, and improved quality-of-life measures. Infusions were well tolerated; four patients experienced mild-to-moderate reactions, suggestive of hypersensitivity, that were managed conservatively. Of 15 patients, 8 (53%) developed IgG antibodies to r-halphaGalA; however, the antibodies were not neutralizing, as indicated by unchanged pharmacokinetic values for infusions 1 and 5. This study provides the basis for a phase 3 trial of enzyme-replacement therapy for Fabry disease.",

The promise of whole genome amplification (WGA) is that genomic DNA (gDNA) quantity will not limit molecular genetic analyses. Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and the OmniPlex PCR-based WGA protocols were evaluated using 4 and 5 ng of input gDNA from 60 gDNA samples from three tissue sources (mouthwash, buffy coat, and lymphoblast). WGA DNA (wgaDNA) yield and genotyping performance were evaluated using genotypes determined from gDNA and wgaDNA using the AmpFlSTR Identifiler assay and N = 49 TaqMan SNP assays. Short tandem repeat (STR) and SNP genotyping completion and concordance rates were significantly reduced with wgaDNA from all WGA methods compared with gDNA. OmniPlex wgaDNA exhibited a greater reduction in genotyping performance than MDA wgaDNA. Reduced wgaDNA genotyping performance was due to allelic (all protocols) and locus (OmniPlex) amplification bias leading to heterozygote and locus dropout, respectively, and %GC sequence content (%GC) was significantly correlated with TaqMan assay performance. Lymphoblast wgaDNA exhibited higher yield (OmniPlex), buffy coat wgaDNA exhibited higher STR genotyping completion (MDA), whereas mouthwash wgaDNA exhibited higher SNP genotyping discordance (MDA). Genotyping of wgaDNA generated from < or = 5 ng gDNA, e.g., from archaeological, forensic, prenatal diagnostic, or pathology samples, may require additional genotyping validation with gDNA and/or more sophisticated analysis of genotypes incorporating observed reductions in genotyping performance.",

Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL), also known as \"Nasu-Hakola disease,\" is a globally distributed recessively inherited disease leading to death during the 5th decade of life and is characterized by early-onset progressive dementia and bone cysts. Elsewhere, we have identified PLOSL mutations in TYROBP (DAP12), which codes for a membrane receptor component in natural-killer and myeloid cells, and also have identified genetic heterogeneity in PLOSL, with some patients carrying no mutations in TYROBP. Here we complete the molecular pathology of PLOSL by identifying TREM2 as the second PLOSL gene. TREM2 forms a receptor signaling complex with TYROBP and triggers activation of the immune responses in macrophages and dendritic cells. Patients with PLOSL have no defects in cell-mediated immunity, suggesting a remarkable capacity of the human immune system to compensate for the inactive TYROBP-mediated activation pathway. Our data imply that the TYROBP-mediated signaling pathway plays a significant role in human brain and bone tissue and provide an interesting example of how mutations in two different subunits of a multisubunit receptor complex result in an identical human disease phenotype.",

                "text": "A meta-analysis of nonsense mutations causing human genetic disease. Nonsense mutations account for approximately 11% of all described gene lesions causing human inherited disease and approximately 20% of disease-associated single-basepair substitutions affecting gene coding regions. Pathological nonsense mutations resulting in TGA (38.5%), TAG (40.4%), and TAA (21.1%) occur in different proportions to naturally occurring stop codons. Of the 23 different nucleotide substitutions giving rise to nonsense mutations, the most frequent are CGA --> TGA (21%; resulting from methylation-mediated deamination) and CAG --> TAG (19%). The differing nonsense mutation frequencies are largely explicable in terms of variable nucleotide substitution rates such that it is unnecessary to invoke differential translational termination efficiency or differential codon usage. Some genes are characterized by numerous nonsense mutations but relatively few if any missense mutations (e.g., CHM) whereas other genes exhibit many missense mutations but few if any nonsense mutations (e.g., PSEN1). Genes in the latter category have a tendency to encode proteins characterized by multimer formation. Consistent with the operation of a clinical selection bias, genes exhibiting an excess of nonsense mutations are also likely to display an excess of frameshift mutations. Tumor suppressor (TS) genes exhibit a disproportionate number of nonsense mutations while most mutations in oncogenes are missense. A total of 12% of somatic nonsense mutations in TS genes were found to occur recurrently in the hypermutable CpG dinucleotide. In a comparison of somatic and germline mutational spectra for 17 TS genes, approximately 43% of somatic nonsense mutations had counterparts in the germline (rising to 98% for CpG mutations). Finally, the proportion of disease-causing nonsense mutations predicted to elicit nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is significantly higher (P=1.56 x 10(-9)) than among nonobserved (potential) nonsense mutations, implying that nonsense mutations that elicit NMD are more likely to come to clinical attention.",

                "text": "Accurate inference of relationships in sib-pair linkage studies. Relative-pair designs are routinely employed in linkage studies of complex genetic diseases and quantitative traits. Valid application of these methods requires correct specification of the relationships of the pairs. For example, within a sibship, presumed full sibs actually might be MZ twins, half sibs, or unrelated. Misclassification of half-sib pairs or unrelated individuals as full sibs can result in reduced power to detect linkage. When other family members, such as parents or additional siblings, are available, incorrectly specified relationships usually will be detected through apparent incompatibilities with Mendelian inheritance. Without other family members, sibling relationships cannot be determined absolutely, but they still can be inferred probabilistically if sufficient genetic marker data are available. In this paper, we describe a simple likelihood ratio method to infer the true relationship of a putative sibling pair. We explore the number of markers required to accurately infer relationships typically encountered in a sib-pair study, as a function of marker allele frequencies, marker spacing, and genotyping error rate, and we conclude that very accurate inference of relationships can be achieved, given the marker data from even part of a genome scan. We compare our method to related methods of relationship inference that have been suggested. Finally, we demonstrate the value of excluding non-full sibs in a genetic linkage study of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.",

The mutation 3243A-->G is the most common heteroplasmic pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation in humans, but it is not understood why the proportion of this mutation decreases in blood during life. Changing levels of mtDNA heteroplasmy are fundamentally related to the pathophysiology of the mitochondrial disease and correlate with clinical progression. To understand this process, we simulated the segregation of mtDNA in hematopoietic stem cells and leukocyte precursors. Our observations show that the percentage of mutant mtDNA in blood decreases exponentially over time. This is consistent with the existence of a selective process acting at the stem cell level and explains why the level of mutant mtDNA in blood is almost invariably lower than in nondividing (postmitotic) tissues such as skeletal muscle. By using this approach, we derived a formula from human data to correct for the change in heteroplasmy over time. A comparison of age-corrected blood heteroplasmy levels with skeletal muscle, an embryologically distinct postmitotic tissue, provides independent confirmation of the model. These findings indicate that selection against pathogenic mtDNA mutations occurs in a stem cell population.",

In most human populations, the ability to digest lactose contained in milk usually disappears in childhood, but in European-derived populations, lactase activity frequently persists into adulthood (Scrimshaw and Murray 1988). It has been suggested (Cavalli-Sforza 1973; Hollox et al. 2001; Enattah et al. 2002; Poulter et al. 2003) that a selective advantage based on additional nutrition from dairy explains these genetically determined population differences (Simoons 1970; Kretchmer 1971; Scrimshaw and Murray 1988; Enattah et al. 2002), but formal population-genetics-based evidence of selection has not yet been provided. To assess the population-genetics evidence for selection, we typed 101 single-nucleotide polymorphisms covering 3.2 Mb around the lactase gene. In northern European-derived populations, two alleles that are tightly associated with lactase persistence (Enattah et al. 2002) uniquely mark a common (~77%) haplotype that extends largely undisrupted for >1 Mb. We provide two new lines of genetic evidence that this long, common haplotype arose rapidly due to recent selection: (1) by use of the traditional F(ST) measure and a novel test based on p(excess), we demonstrate large frequency differences among populations for the persistence-associated markers and for flanking markers throughout the haplotype, and (2) we show that the haplotype is unusually long, given its high frequency--a hallmark of recent selection. We estimate that strong selection occurred within the past 5,000-10,000 years, consistent with an advantage to lactase persistence in the setting of dairy farming; the signals of selection we observe are among the strongest yet seen for any gene in the genome.",

The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptors superfamily, mediates the response to melanocortins and is currently the best-described contributor to normal pigment variation in humans. A remarkably large number of natural polymorphisms, or variants, of the MC1R gene have been identified in different populations. Some of these variants have been associated with specific hair and skin color phenotypes, the presence of freckling, and melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer risk. Interestingly, some MC1R variants have been associated with skin cancer beyond their effects on pigmentation. Although the red hair color variants (RHC variants) have been associated with skin cancer risk in the Celtic population, studies in darkly-pigmented Caucasian populations have demonstrated the importance of non-RHC MC1R variants on skin cancer risk as well. We have reviewed and compared allele frequency differences of MC1R variants across geographic regions. We observed large differences in the distribution of variants across populations, with a prominent difference between lightly and darkly-pigmented individuals. Moreover, among Caucasian groups, there were seven variants (p.V60L, p.V92M, p.D84E, p.R151C, p.R160W, p.R163Q, and p.D294H) with significantly different allele frequencies. Exploring differences in allele frequencies of MC1R variants across populations with varying pigmentation and differing skin cancer risk may improve our understanding of the complex relationship between MC1R, pigmentation, and carcinogenesis.",

                "text": "A missense mutation in PRPF6 causes impairment of pre-mRNA splicing and autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited form of retinal degeneration that leads to progressive visual-field constriction and blindness. Although the disease manifests only in the retina, mutations in ubiquitously expressed genes associated with the tri-snRNP complex of the spliceosome have been identified in patients with dominantly inherited RP. We screened for mutations in PRPF6 (NM_012469.3), a gene on chromosome 20q13.33 encoding an essential protein for tri-snRNP assembly and stability, in 188 unrelated patients with autosomal-dominant RP and identified a missense mutation, c.2185C>T (p.Arg729Trp). This change affected a residue that is conserved from humans to yeast and cosegregated with the disease in the family in which it was identified. Lymphoblasts derived from patients with this mutation showed abnormal localization of endogenous PRPF6 within the nucleus. Specifically, this protein accumulated in the Cajal bodies, indicating a possible impairment in the tri-snRNP assembly or recycling. Expression of GFP-tagged PRPF6 in HeLa cells showed that this phenomenon depended exclusively on the mutated form of the protein. Furthermore, analysis of endogenous transcripts in cells from patients revealed intron retention for pre-mRNA bearing specific splicing signals, according to the same pattern displayed by lymphoblasts with mutations in other PRPF genes. Our results identify PRPF6 as the sixth gene involved in pre-mRNA splicing and dominant RP, corroborating the hypothesis that deficiencies in the spliceosome play an important role in the molecular pathology of this disease.",

Disequilibrium between genetic markers is expected to decline monotonically with recombinational map distance. We present evidence from the HLA class II region that seems to violate this principle. Pairwise disequilibrium values were calculated from six loci ranging in physical separation from 15 kb to 550 kb. The histocompatibility loci DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1, located on the distal end of the class II region, behave as a single evolutionary unit within which extremely high linkage disequilibrium exists. Lower but still significant levels of disequilibrium are present between these loci and DPB1, located at the proximal edge of the HLA complex. The peptide-transporter loci TAP1 and TAP2, located in the intervening region, reveal no disequilibrium with each other and low or negligible disequilibrium with the flanking loci. The action of two genetic process is required to account for this phenomenon: a recombinational hotspot operating between TAP1 and TAP2, to eliminate disequilibrium between these loci, and at the same time selection operating on particular combinations of alleles across the DR-DP region, to create disequilibrium in the favored haplotypes. The forces producing the patterns of disequilibrium observed here have implications for the mapping of train loci and disease genes: markers of TAP1, for example, would give a false impression as to the influence of DPB1 on a trait known to be associated with DQB1.",

We performed a genome-wide association scan for hair morphology (straight, wavy, curly) in three Australian samples of European descent. All three samples showed evidence of association implicating the Trichohyalin gene (TCHH), which is expressed in the developing inner root sheath of the hair follicle, and explaining approximately 6% of variance (p=1.5x10(-31)).

Although the power to detect association with an individual rare variant is limited, pooling variants by gene or pathway into a composite test provides an alternative strategy for identifying susceptibility genes. We describe a statistical method for detecting association of multiple rare variants in protein-coding genes with a quantitative or dichotomous trait. The approach is based on the regression of phenotypic values on individuals' genotype scores subject to a variable allele-frequency threshold, incorporating computational predictions of the functional effects of missense variants. Statistical significance is assessed by permutation testing with variable thresholds. We used a rigorous population-genetics simulation framework to evaluate the power of the method, and we applied the method to empirical sequencing data from three disease studies.",

More than 100 different heterozygous mutations in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been found in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Uniquely, D90A-SOD1 has been identified in recessive, dominant and apparently sporadic pedigrees. The phenotype of homozygotes is stereotyped with an extended survival, whereas that of affected heterozygotes varies. The frequency of D90A-SOD1 is 50 times higher in Scandinavia (2.5%) than elsewhere, though ALS prevalence is not raised there. Our earlier study indicated separate founders for recessive and dominant/sporadic ALS and we proposed a disease-modifying factor linked to the recessive mutation. Here we have doubled our sample set and employed novel markers to characterise the mutation's origin and localise any modifying factor. Linkage disequilibrium analysis indicates that D90A homozygotes and heterozygotes share a rare haplotype and are all descended from a single ancient founder (alpha 0.974) c.895 generations ago. Homozygotes arose subsequently only c.63 generations ago (alpha 0.878). Recombination has reduced the region shared by recessive kindreds to 97-265 kb around SOD1, excluding all neighbouring genes. We propose that a cis-acting regulatory polymorphism has arisen close to D90A-SOD1 in the recessive founder, which decreases ALS susceptibility in heterozygotes and slows disease progression.",

                "text": "Mutation screening of the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. In a previous study, we have shown that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), classified in databases as a tumor suppressor and heavy metal-response protein, is mutated in hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy Lom (HMSNL), a severe autosomal recessive form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. The private founder mutation R148X, causing HMSNL in patients of Romani ethnicity, has so far remained the only molecular defect linking NDRG1 to a specific disease phenotype. Here we report the first study aiming to assess the overall contribution of this gene to the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathies, in cases where the most common causes of CMT disease have been excluded. Sequence analysis of NDRG1 in 104 CMT patients of diverse ethnicity identified one novel disease-causing mutation, IVS8-1G>A (g.2290787G>A), which affects the splice-acceptor site of IVS8 and results in the skipping of exon 9. The phenotype of the IVS8-1G>A homozygote was very closely related to that of HMSNL patients. In addition, we have detected homozygosity for the known R148X mutation in two affected individuals. Mutations in NDRG1 thus accounted for 2.88% of our overall group of patients, and for 4.68% of cases with demyelinating neuropathies. No other variants were identified in the coding sequence, whereas 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms were observed in the introns. Hum Mutat 22:129-135, 2003.",

                "text": "Microarray-based copy number analysis of neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1)-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors reveals a role for Rho-GTPase pathway genes in NF1 tumorigenesis. Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) is associated with the growth of benign and malignant tumors. Approximately 15% of NF1 patients develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), underlining the need to identify specific diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers associated with MPNST development. The Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Array 6.0 was used to perform SNP genotyping and copy number alteration (CNA), loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), and copy number neutral-LOH (CNN-LOH) analyses of DNA isolated from 15 MPNSTs, five benign plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs), and patient-matched lymphocyte DNAs. MPNSTs exhibited high-level CNN-LOH, with recurrent changes occurring in MPNSTs but not PNFs. CNN-LOH was evident in MPNSTs but occurred less frequently than genomic deletions. CNAs involving the ITGB8, PDGFA, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) (7p21-p22), PDGFRL (8p22-p21.3), and matrix metallopeptidase 12 (MMP12) (11q22.3) genes were specific to MPNSTs. Pathway analysis revealed the MPNST-specific amplification of seven Rho-GTPase pathway genes and several cytoskeletal remodeling/cell adhesion genes. In knockdown experiments employing short-hairpin RAC1, ROCK2, PTK2, and LIMK1 RNAs to transfect both control and MPNST-derived cell lines, cell adhesion was significantly increased in the MPNST cell lines, whereas wound healing, cell migration, and invasiveness were reduced, consistent with a role for these Rho-GTPase pathway genes in MPNST development and metastasis. These results suggest new targets for therapeutic intervention in relation to MPNSTs.",

                "text": "Niemann-Pick type C disease: subcellular location and functional characterization of NPC2 proteins with naturally occurring missense mutations. Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), a severe neurovisceral lysosomal disorder, is due to mutations on the NPC1 gene or, in a minority of families, the NPC2 gene. Few investigations have been devoted to the NPC2 protein, for which only 13 different disease-causing mutations (including three novel ones in this report) have been described. Among the currently known NPC2 mutant alleles, six resulted in a premature stop codon. Only five missense mutations, c.115G>A (p.V39M), c.140G>T (p.C47F), c.199T>C (p.S67P), c.278G>T (p.C93F), and (this report) c.295T>C (p.C99R) were identified. In the present study, we generated cDNA constructs harboring each of these missense mutations and, upon overexpression in human fibroblasts with a nonsense NPC2 mutation, characterized the mutated proteins by immunoblotting, immunocytofluorescence microscopy, and complementation. Mutation p.V39M, described in the homozygous state in two patients with an adult-onset neurological disease, resulted in the synthesis of apparently functional recombinant proteins correctly targeted to lysosomes. Although a mild functional impact could possibly be overlooked in our overexpression system, comparative studies with NPC1 mutants indicated that mild mutations might not necessarily affect localization of the protein or its quantity in the native state. Conversely, mutations p.C47F, p.C93R, p.C99R but also, less predictably, p.S67P, led to the synthesis of misfolded recombinant proteins that colocalized with an endoplasmic reticulum marker. The four latter proteins were normally secreted but were unable to correct cholesterol storage in NPC2(-/-) cells. Functional characterization of the mutant proteins showed an excellent genotype-phenotype correlation in the three cases for whom a clinical history was available.",

Mutations of the prion protein (PrP) gene are present in patients with Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). We developed a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) strategy that readily identifies point mutations in the PrP coding sequence. By comparison with appropriate controls, haplotypes often may be deduced. This method permits samples from many patients with GSS, CJD, as well as patients with unusual degenerative neurologic disorders, to be screened rapidly, sensitively, and inexpensively for the presence of known and novel PrP mutations. We illustrate the sensitivity of this approach by reporting 2 novel polymorphisms in the PrP coding sequence.",

The BUB1 gene is a key player in the mitotic spindle checkpoint machinery that monitors proper segregation of sister chromatides during mitosis. It has been suggested that mutations in BUB1 may disrupt the spindle checkpoint and thereby cause chromosomal instability, which is a hallmark of solid tumors including those from the breast. From a series of breast carcinomas we selected 20 cases with genomic instability, as scored by Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH), and without somatic TP53 (p53) mutations, and sequenced the entire coding region of the BUB1 gene. Two different constitutional sequence variants were found; a base substitution in exon 5, c.481G>A (CAG>CAA, a synonymous change encoding Gln144) in two samples, and a base substitution 8 bp upstream of exon 10, c.1007-8T>C in two other samples. No somatic mutations were detected. These results indicate that genomic instability scored as copy number alterations by CGH in TP53 wild type breast carcinomas is not caused by somatic mutations in the BUB1 gene.",

                "text": "A comparative analysis of the genetic epidemiology of deafness in the United States in two sets of pedigrees collected more than a century apart. In 1898, E.A. Fay published an analysis of nearly 5000 marriages among deaf individuals in America collected during the 19(th) century. Each pedigree included three-generation data on marriage partners that included at least one deaf proband, who were ascertained by complete selection. We recently proposed that the intense phenotypic assortative mating among the deaf might have greatly accelerated the normally slow response to relaxed genetic selection against deafness that began in many Western countries with the introduction of sign language and the establishment of residential schools. Simulation studies suggest that this mechanism might have doubled the frequency of the commonest forms of recessive deafness (DFNB1) in this country during the past 200 years. To test this prediction, we collected pedigree data on 311 contemporary marriages among deaf individuals that were comparable to those collected by Fay. Segregation analysis of the resulting data revealed that the estimated proportion of noncomplementary matings that can produce only deaf children has increased by a factor of more than five in the past 100 years. Additional analysis within our sample of contemporary pedigrees showed that there was a statistically significant linear increase in the prevalence of pathologic GJB2 mutations when the data on 441 probands were partitioned into three 20-year birth cohorts (1920 through 1980). These data are consistent with the increase in the frequency of DFNB1 predicted by our previous simulation studies and provide convincing evidence for the important influence that assortative mating can have on the frequency of common genes for deafness.",

                "text": "Loss of nephrocystin-3 function can cause embryonic lethality, Meckel-Gruber-like syndrome, situs inversus, and renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia. Many genetic diseases have been linked to the dysfunction of primary cilia, which occur nearly ubiquitously in the body and act as solitary cellular mechanosensory organelles. The list of clinical manifestations and affected tissues in cilia-related disorders (ciliopathies) such as nephronophthisis is broad and has been attributed to the wide expression pattern of ciliary proteins. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms leading to this dramatic diversity of phenotypes. We recently reported hypomorphic NPHP3 mutations in children and young adults with isolated nephronophthisis and associated hepatic fibrosis or tapetoretinal degeneration. Here, we chose a combinatorial approach in mice and humans to define the phenotypic spectrum of NPHP3/Nphp3 mutations and the role of the nephrocystin-3 protein. We demonstrate that the pcy mutation generates a hypomorphic Nphp3 allele that is responsible for the cystic kidney disease phenotype, whereas complete loss of Nphp3 function results in situs inversus, congenital heart defects, and embryonic lethality in mice. In humans, we show that NPHP3 mutations can cause a broad clinical spectrum of early embryonic patterning defects comprising situs inversus, polydactyly, central nervous system malformations, structural heart defects, preauricular fistulas, and a wide range of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). On the functional level, we show that nephrocystin-3 directly interacts with inversin and can inhibit like inversin canonical Wnt signaling, whereas nephrocystin-3 deficiency leads in Xenopus laevis to typical planar cell polarity defects, suggesting a role in the control of canonical and noncanonical (planar cell polarity) Wnt signaling.",

During the past few years, there has been a great deal of new work on methods for mapping quantitative-trait loci by use of sibling pairs and sibships. There are several new methods based on linear regression, as well as several more that are based on score statistics. In theory, most of the new methods should be relatively robust to violations of distributional assumptions and to selected sampling, but, in practice, there has been little evaluation of how the methods perform on selected samples. We survey most of the new regression-based statistics and score statistics and propose a few minor variations on the score statistics. We use simulation to evaluate the type I error and the power of all of the statistics, considering (a) population samples of sibling pairs and (b) sibling pairs ascertained on the basis of at least one sibling with a trait value in the top 10% of the distribution. Most of the statistics have correct type I error for selected samples. The statistics proposed by Xu et al. and by Sham and Purcell are generally the most powerful, along with one of our score statistic variants. Even among the methods that are most powerful for \"nice\" data, some are more robust than others to non-Gaussian trait models and/or misspecified trait parameters.",

About 70% of HHL is non-syndromic, with autosomal recessive forms accounting for approximately 85% of the genetic load. Although very heterogeneous, the most common cause of HHL in many different world populations is mutations of GJB2, a gene that encodes the gap junction protein connexin 26 (Cx26). This study investigates the contribution of GJB2 to the autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness (ARNSD) load in the Iranian population. One hundred sixty eight persons from 83 families were studied. GJB2-related deafness was diagnosed in 9 families (4, 35delG homozygotes; 3, 35delG compound heterozygotes; 1, W24X homozygote; 1, non-35delG compound heterozygote). The carrier frequency of the 35delG allele in this population was approximately 1% (1/83). Because the relative frequency of Cx26 mutations is much less than in the other populations, it is possible that mutations in other genes play a major role in ARNSD in Iran.",

Brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by a thin cornea that tends to perforate, causing progressive visual loss and blindness. Additional systemic symptoms such as joint hypermotility, hyperlaxity of the skin, and kyphoscoliosis place BCS among the connective-tissue disorders. Previously, we assigned the disease gene to a 4.7 Mb interval on chromosome 16q24. In order to clone the BCS gene, we first narrowed the disease locus to a 2.8 Mb interval and systematically sequenced genes expressed in connective tissue in this chromosomal segment. We have identified two frameshift mutations in the Zinc-Finger 469 gene (ZNF469). In five unrelated patients of Tunisian Jewish ancestry, we found a 1 bp deletion at position 5943 (5943 delA), and in an inbred Palestinian family we detected a single-nucleotide deletion at position 9527 (9527 delG). The function of ZNF469 is unknown. However, a 30% homology to a number of collagens suggests that it could act as a transcription factor involved in the synthesis and/or organization of collagen fibers.",

Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is a potentially lethal inherited defect in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. By comparing the behaviour of five missense MCAD mutant proteins expressed in COS cells and in Escherichia coli, we can define some of these as \"pure folding mutants.\" Upon expression in E. coli, these mutant proteins produce activity levels in the range of the wild-type enzyme only if the chaperonins GroESL are co-overproduced. When overexpressed in COS cells, the pure folding mutants display enzyme activities comparable to the wild-type enzyme. The results suggest that the MCAD mutations can be modulated by chaperones, a phenomenon that may influence the manifestation of the MCAD disease.",

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) of the spine is a subset of \"bone-forming\" diseases, characterized by ectopic ossification in the spinal ligaments. OPLL is a common disorder among elderly populations in eastern Asia and is the leading cause of spinal myelopathy in Japan. We performed a genomewide linkage study with 142 affected sib pairs, to identify genetic loci related to OPLL. In multipoint linkage analysis using GENEHUNTER-PLUS, evidence of linkage to OPLL was detected on chromosomes 1p, 6p, 11q, 14q, 16q, and 21q. The best evidence of linkage was detected near D21S1903 on chromosome 21q22.3 (maximum Zlr=3.97); therefore, the linkage region was extensively investigated for linkage disequilibrium with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 20 Mb. One hundred fifty positional candidate genes lie in the region, and 600 gene-based SNPs were genotyped. There were positive allelic associations with seven genes (P<.01) in 280 patients and 210 controls, and four of the seven genes were clustered within a region of 750 kb, approximately 1.2 Mb telomeric to D21S1903. Extensive linkage disequilibrium and association studies of the four genes indicated that SNPs in the collagen 6A1 gene (COL6A1) were strongly associated with OPLL (P=.000003 for the SNP in intron 32 [-29]). Haplotype analysis with three SNPs in COL6A1 gave a single-point P value of.0000007. Identification of the locus of susceptibility to OPLL by genomewide linkage and linkage disequilibrium studies permits us to investigate the pathogenesis of the disease, which may lead to the development of novel therapeutic tools.",

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, complex, and systemic human autoimmune disease, with both an environmental component and a heritable predisposition. Clinical studies, reinforced by epidemiology and genetics, show impressive variation in disease severity, expression, prevalence, and incidence by ethnicity and sex. To identify the novel SLE susceptibility loci, we performed a genomewide scan with 318 markers on 37 multiplex Hispanic families, using a nonparametric penetrance-independent affected-only allele-sharing method. Three chromosomal regions (12q24, 16p13, and 16q12-21) exceeded our predetermined threshold (Zlr>2.32; nominal P<.01) for further evaluation. Suspected linkages at 12q24, 16p13, and 16q12-21 were tested in an independent data set consisting of 92 European American (EA-1) and 55 African American (AA) families. The linkage at 12q24 was replicated in EA-1 (Zlr=3.06; P=.001) but not in AA (Zlr=0.37; P=.35). Although neither the 16p13 nor the 16q12-21 was confirmed in EA-1 or AA, the suggestive linkage (Zlr=3.06; P=.001) at 16q12-21 is sufficient to confirm the significant linkage, reported elsewhere, at this location. The evidence for linkage at 12q24 in the 129 combined (Hispanic and EA-1) families exceeded the threshold for genomewide significance (Zlr=4.39; P=5.7x10-6; nonparametric LOD=4.19). Parametric linkage analyses suggested a low-penetrance, dominant model (LOD=3.72). To confirm the linkage effect at 12q24, we performed linkage analysis in another set of 82 independent European American families (EA-2). The evidence for linkage was confirmed (Zlr=2.11; P=.017). Therefore, our results have detected, established, and confirmed the existence of a novel SLE susceptibility locus at 12q24 (designated \"SLEB4\") that may cause lupus, especially in Hispanic and European American families.",

Alport syndrome is a mainly X-linked hereditary disease of basement membranes that is characterized by progressive renal failure, deafness, and ocular lesions. It is associated with mutations of the COL4A5 gene located at Xq22 and encoding the alpha5 chain of type IV collagen. We have screened 48 of the 51 exons of the COL4A5 gene by SSCP analysis and have identified 64 mutations and 10 sequence variants among 131 unrelated Alport syndrome patients. This represents a mutation-detection rate of 50%. There were no hot-spot mutations and no recurrent mutations in our population. The identified mutations were 6 nonsense mutations, 12 frameshift mutations, 17 splice-site mutations, and 29 missense mutations, 27 of the latter being glycine substitutions in the collagenous domain. Two of these occurred on the same allele in one patient and segregated with the disease in the family. We showed that some of the glycine substitutions could be associated with the lack of immunological expression of the alpha3(IV)-alpha5(IV) collagen chains in the glomerular basement membrane.",

                "text": "Identification of copy number variation hotspots in human populations. Copy number variants (CNVs) in the human genome contribute to both Mendelian and complex traits as well as to genomic plasticity in evolution. The investigation of mutational rates of CNVs is critical to understanding genomic instability and the etiology of the copy number variation (CNV)-related traits. However, the evaluation of the CNV mutation rate at the genome level poses an insurmountable practical challenge that requires large samples and accurate typing. In this study, we show that an approximate estimation of the CNV mutation rate could be achieved by using the phylogeny information of flanking SNPs. This allows a genome-wide comparison of mutation rates between CNVs with the use of vast, readily available data of SNP genotyping. A total of 4187 CNV regions (CNVRs) previously identified in HapMap populations were investigated in this study. We showed that the mutation rates for the majority of these CNVRs are at the order of 10\u207b\u2075 per generation, consistent with experimental observations at individual loci. Notably, the mutation rates of 104 (2.5%) CNVRs were estimated at the order of 10\u207b\u00b3 per generation; therefore, they were identified as potential hotspots. Additional analyses revealed that genome architecture at CNV loci has a potential role in inciting mutational hotspots in the human genome. Interestingly, 49 (47%) CNV hotspots include human genes, some of which are known to be functional CNV loci (e.g., CNVs of C4 and \u03b2-defensin causing autoimmune diseases and CNVs of HYDIN with implication in control of cerebral cortex size), implicating the important role of CNV in human health and evolution, especially in common and complex diseases.",

                "text": "Elevated levels of FMR1 mRNA in carrier males: a new mechanism of involvement in the fragile-X syndrome. Fragile-X syndrome is a trinucleotide-repeat-expansion disorder in which the clinical phenotype is believed to result from transcriptional silencing of the fragile-X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene as the number of CGG repeats exceeds approximately 200. For premutation alleles ( approximately 55-200 repeats), no abnormalities in FMR1-gene expression have been described, despite growing evidence of clinical involvement in premutation carriers. To address this (apparent) paradox, we have determined, for 16 carrier males (55-192 repeats), the relative levels of leukocyte FMR1 mRNA, by use of automated fluorescence-detection reverse transcriptase-PCR, and the percent of lymphocytes that are immunoreactive for FMR1 protein (FMRP). For some alleles with>100 repeats, there was a reduction in the number of FMRP-positive cells. Unexpectedly, FMR1 mRNA levels were elevated at least fivefold within this same range. No significant increase in FMR1 mRNA stability was observed in a lymphoblastoid cell line (160 repeats) derived from one of the carrier males, suggesting that the increased message levels are due to an increased rate of transcription. Current results support a mechanism of involvement in premutation carriers, in which reduced translational efficiency is at least partially compensated through increased transcriptional activity. Thus, diminished translational efficiency may be important throughout much of the premutation range, with a mechanistic switch occurring in the full-mutation range as the FMR1 gene is silenced.",

Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) is a crucial regulator of bone formation during embryonic development. Both gain and loss-of-function studies in mice have shown that FGFR2 maintains a critical balance between the proliferation and differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. We have identified de novo FGFR2 mutations in a sporadically occurring perinatal lethal skeletal dysplasia characterized by poor mineralization of the calvarium, craniosynostosis, dysmorphic facial features, prenatal teeth, hypoplastic pubis and clavicles, osteopenia, and bent long bones. Histological analysis of the long bones revealed that the growth plate contained smaller hypertrophic chondrocytes and a thickened hypercellular periosteum. Four unrelated affected individuals were found to be heterozygous for missense mutations that introduce a polar amino acid into the hydrophobic transmembrane domain of FGFR2. Using diseased chondrocytes and a cell-based assay, we determined that these mutations selectively reduced plasma-membrane levels of FGFR2 and markedly diminished the receptor's responsiveness to extracellular FGF. All together, these clinical and molecular findings are separate from previously characterized FGFR2 disorders and represent a distinct skeletal dysplasia.",

                "text": "Novel mutations of the PCSK9 gene cause variable phenotype of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) is a frequent (1/500) monogenic inherited disorder characterized by isolated elevation of LDL leading to premature cardiovascular disease. ADH is known to result from mutations at two main loci: LDLR (encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor), and APOB (encoding apolipoprotein B100), its natural ligand. We previously demonstrated that ADH is also caused by mutations of the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) gene that encodes Narc-1 (neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1). However, the role of this novel disease locus as a cause of hypercholesterolemia remains unclear. In the present study, we analysed the PCSK9 coding region and intronic junctions in 130 adult or pediatric patients with ADH, previously found as being non LDLR/non APOB mutation carriers. Four novel heterozygous missense variations were found: c.654A>T (p.R218S), c.1070G>A (p.R357H), c.1405C>T (p.R469W), and c.1327G>A (p.A443T). All mutations were absent in 340 normolipidemic controls. Except for the A443T, all mutations are nonconservative and modify a highly conserved residue. Segregation with hypercholesterolemia is incomplete in one pedigree. Type and severity of hyperlipidemia and of cardiovascular disease could vary among subjects from the same family. Finally, the proband carrying the R357H mutation exhibited very high plasma cholesterol during pregnancy, whereas the proband carrying the p.R469W mutation exhibited a severe phenotype of hypercholesterolemia in combination with a LDLR mutation resulting from a frameshift at residue F382 (1209delC). These observations suggest that variations in PCSK9 are a rare cause of non LDLR/non APOB ADH (approximately 2.3%) and that additional environmental or genetic factors may contribute to the phenotype caused by PCSK9 missense mutations in humans.",

X inactivation--the mammalian method of X chromosome dosage compensation--is extremely stable in human somatic cells; only fetal germ cells have a developmental program to reverse the process. The human placenta, at term, differs from other somatic tissues, since it has the ability to reverse the X-inactivation program. To determine whether reversal can be induced at other stages of placental development, we examined earlier placental specimens using a cell-hybridization assay. We found that global X reactivation is also inducible in villi cells from first-trimester spontaneous abortions but not from first-trimester elective terminations. These differences in inducibility are not associated with detectable variation in histone H4 acetylation, DNA methylation, or XIST expression--hallmarks of the inactivation process--so other factors must have a role. One notable feature is that the permissive cells, unlike nonpermissive ones, have ceased to proliferate in vivo and are either beginning or in the process of programmed cell death. Cessation of mitotic proliferation also characterizes oocytes at the stage at which they undergo X reactivation. We suggest that, along with undermethylation, the apoptotic changes accompanying cessation of cell proliferation contribute to the reversal of inactivation, not only in placental cells, but also in oocytes entering meiosis.",

                "text": "Detecting disease-predisposing variants: the haplotype method. For many HLA-associated diseases, multiple alleles-- and, in some cases, multiple loci--have been suggested as the causative agents. The haplotype method for identifying disease-predisposing amino acids in a genetic region is a stratification analysis. We show that, for each haplotype combination containing all the amino acid sites involved in the disease process, the relative frequencies of amino acid variants at sites not involved in disease but in linkage disequilibrium with the disease-predisposing sites are expected to be the same in patients and controls. The haplotype method is robust to mode of inheritance and penetrance of the disease and can be used to determine unequivocally whether all amino acid sites involved in the disease have not been identified. Using a resampling technique, we developed a statistical test that takes account of the nonindependence of the sites sampled. Further, when multiple sites in the genetic region are involved in disease, the test statistic gives a closer fit to the null expectation when some--compared with none--of the true predisposing factors are included in the haplotype analysis. Although the haplotype method cannot distinguish between very highly correlated sites in one population, ethnic comparisons may help identify the true predisposing factors. The haplotype method was applied to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) HLA class II DQA1-DQB1 data from Caucasian, African, and Japanese populations. Our results indicate that the combination DQA1#52 (Arg predisposing) DQB1#57 (Asp protective), which has been proposed as an important IDDM agent, does not include all the predisposing elements. With rheumatoid arthritis HLA class II DRB1 data, the results were consistent with the shared-epitope hypothesis.",

In a single case of fibrochondrogenesis, whole-genome SNP genotyping identified unknown ancestral consanguinity by detecting three autozygous regions. Because of the predominantly skeletal nature of the phenotype, the 389 genes localized to the autozygous intervals were prioritized for mutation analysis by correlation of their expression with known cartilage-selective genes via the UCLA Gene Expression Tool, UGET. The gene encoding the \u03b11 chain of type XI collagen (COL11A1) was the only cartilage-selective gene among the three candidate intervals. Sequence analysis of COL11A1 in two genetically independent fibrochondrogenesis cases demonstrated that each was a compound heterozygote for a loss-of-function mutation on one allele and a mutation predicting substitution for a conserved triple-helical glycine residue on the other. The parents who were carriers of missense mutations had myopia. Early-onset hearing loss was noted in both parents who carried a loss-of-function allele, suggesting COL11A1 as a locus for mild, dominantly inherited hearing loss. These findings identify COL11A1 as a locus for fibrochondrogenesis and indicate that there might be phenotypic manifestations among carriers.",

Using allele-specific amplification method (ARMS), a highly sensitive one-stage allele-specific PCR, we have evaluated the incidence of NRAS and KRAS2 activating mutations (codons 12, 13, and 61) in 62 patients with either monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or multiple myeloma (MM), primary plasma-cell leukemia (P-PCL), and also in human myeloma cell lines (HMCL). NRAS and/or KRAS2 mutations were found in 54.5% of MM at diagnosis (but in 81% at the time of relapse), in 50% of P-PCL, and in 50% of 16 HMCL. In contrast, the occurrence of such mutations was very low in MGUS and indolent MM (12.50%). Of note, KRAS2 mutations were always more frequent than NRAS. The validity of the technique was assessed by direct sequencing of cell lines and of some patients. Multiple mutations found in two patients were confirmed by subcloning exon PCR amplification products, testing clones with our method, and sequencing them. Thus, these early mutations could play a major role in the oncogenesis of MM and P-PCL.",

Families in which both parents are heterozygotes for the same autosomal dominant neoplasia syndrome are extremely unusual. Recently, we had the unique opportunity to evaluate three symptomatic siblings from the union between two unrelated individuals affected by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). When the three siblings and their parents and relatives were genotyped for 12 markers tightly linked to the MEN1 locus, at 11q13, two of the siblings were found to be homozygotes, and one a heterozygote, for MEN1. With regard to the MEN1 syndrome, no phenotypic differences were observed between the two homozygotes and the heterozygotes. However, the two homozygotes showed unexplained infertility, which was not the case for any of the heterozygotes. Thus, MEN1 appears to be a disease with complete dominance, and the presence of two MEN1 alleles with mutations of the type that occur constitutionally may be insufficient for tumor development.",

Two studies have reported significant associations between susceptibility to prostate cancer and two common missense variants of the HPC2/ELAC2 gene, with estimated relative risks in the range of two- to threefold. We investigated whether these polymorphisms could be informative in the prediction of the presence of prostate cancer in men undergoing prostatic biopsy for the evaluation of an elevated serum-PSA level (> or = 4.0 ng/ml). We genotyped 944 men who underwent a prostate biopsy at our institution, as well as a control population of 922 healthy, unselected women from the same population. The prevalence of the HPC2 Ala541Thr allele was similar in men with prostate cancer (6.3%), men with other prostatic conditions (6.8%), and healthy women (6.3%) (P = .83). We conclude that HPC2 genotyping is unlikely to be a useful adjunct to PSA in the prediction of the presence of biopsy-detected prostate cancer in asymptomatic men.",

Two Mediterranean, one Asian and three novel mutations (CD6 -G, CDs 108 /112-12nt, CDs 130/131 + GCCT) were identified. Altogether, in 30 of the 35 subjects (86%) in which a mutation in the beta-globin gene was identified, the mutation was of Mediterranean origin. The geographical distribution suggests recent migration from the Mediterranean region as cause of the high proportion of frequent Mediterranean beta-thalassemia mutations in the German population.

An A-to-C base substitution at nucleotide position -61 in the promoter region of the human haptoglobin gene (Hp) has been shown to be strongly associated with the haptoglobin 2-1 modified (Hp2-1mod) phenotype. In order to investigate whether this base substitution is the cause of reduced expression of the Hp2 allele relative to the Hp1 allele in individuals with the Hp2-1mod phenotype, we used the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) expression system to evaluate promoter function. In HepG2 cells, which normally express their endogenous haptoglobin genes, CAT plasmid constructs with the -61C base change in the promoter had about 10-fold-lower transcriptional activity after transfection than did the Hp control construct. The -61C substitution also rendered the construct unresponsive to treatment by interleukin-6 after transfection into Hep3B2 cells, which normally do not express haptoglobin but do so in response to stimulation by acute-phase reactants. In addition, two base substitutions, T to A and A to G, at positions -104 and -55G, respectively, in the promoter region of the Hp1 allele, are also associated with the Hp2-1mod phenotype. CAT constructs with both substitutions (-104A-55G) and with one substitution (-55G) showed activity similar to that in the Hp control when transfected into both HepG2 and Hep3B2 cells, although interleukin-6 induction was less than with the Hp control construct. These results further support the hypothesis that the Hp2-1mod phenotype results, in part, from the -61C mutation in the promoter region of the Hp2 gene.",

Knowledge about cause, pathogenesis, and manifestations of hereditary metabolic diseases puts them among the best known of all human diseases. On the other hand, outcomes of treatment are cause for uncertainty and concern. In 1985, Hayes et al. analyzed efficacy of treatment up to 1983 in 65 of these diseases selected randomly from the McKusick catalogs. Disease scores were calculated for seven parameters: longevity; reproductive capability; somatic and cognitive development; and handicaps affecting schooling, work, and cosmetic appearance. Scores of the untreated and treated phenotypes were then compared. We have now measured progress over the past decade by calculating scores on the same 65 diseases from data in several hundred new reports published since 1983. All seven parameters in the 1993 survey reflect improved efficacy of treatment in the 10-year interval. However, the percent of diseases for which all manifestations of the disease were removed by treatment has not changed (12% in 1983; 12% in 1993). The group in which manifestations were untouched by treatment has become smaller (48% in 1983; 31% in 1993), and the group partially ameliorated by treatment had increased reciprocally (40% in 1983; 57% in 1993). Progress in the treatment of hereditary metabolic disease is thus better than it was, but it is still only a partial success. The advances are attributable to greater success with organ and tissue transplantation, better pharmacotherapy, and better support systems. Restoration of normal homeostasis, the key to successful treatment, remains an elusive challenge and is a logical, major focus for research in human genetics.",

The molecular basis for primary hereditary hypertriglyceridemia has been identified in fewer than 5% of cases. Investigation of monogenic dyslipidemias has the potential to expose key metabolic pathways. We describe a hitherto unreported disease in ten individuals manifesting as moderate to severe transient childhood hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver followed by hepatic fibrosis and the identification of the mutated gene responsible for this condition. We performed SNP array-based homozygosity mapping and found a single large continuous segment of homozygosity on chromosomal region 12q13.12. The candidate region contained 35 genes that are listed in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and 27 other genes. We performed candidate gene sequencing and screened both clinically affected individuals (children and adults with hypertriglyceridemia) and also a healthy cohort for mutations in GPD1, which encodes glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1. Mutation analysis revealed a homozygous splicing mutation, c.361-1G>C, which resulted in an aberrantly spliced mRNA in the ten affected individuals. This mutation is predicted to result in a truncated protein lacking essential conserved residues, including a functional site responsible for initial substrate recognition. Functional consequences of the mutation were evaluated by measuring intracellular concentrations of cholesterol and triglyceride as well as triglyceride secretion in HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) human cells lines overexpressing normal and mutant GPD1 cDNA. Overexpression of mutant GPD1 in HepG2 cells, in comparison to overexpression of wild-type GPD1, resulted in increased secretion of triglycerides (p = 0.01). This finding supports the pathogenicity of the identified mutation.",

Studies of association between candidate genes and disease can be designed to use cases with disease, and in place of nonrelated controls, their parents. The advantage of this design is the elimination of spurious differences due to ethnic differences between cases and nonrelated controls. However, several statistical methods of analysis have been proposed in the literature, and the choice of analysis is not always clear. We review some of the statistical methods currently developed and present two new statistical methods aimed at specific genetic hypotheses of dominance and recessivity of the candidate gene. These new methods can be more powerful than other current methods, as demonstrated by simulations. The basis of these new statistical methods is a likelihood approach. The advantage of the likelihood framework is that regression models can be developed to assess genotype-environment interactions, as well as the relative contribution that alleles at the candidate-gene locus make to the relative risk (RR) of disease. This latter development allows testing of (1) whether interactions between alleles exist, on the scale of log RR, and (2) whether alleles originating from the mother or father of a case impart different risks, i.e., genomic imprinting.",

                "text": "Identification of seven novel mutations including the first two genomic rearrangements in SLC26A3 mutated in congenital chloride diarrhea. Congenital chloride diarrhea (CLD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective intestinal electrolyte absorption, resulting in voluminous osmotic diarrhea with high chloride content. A variety of mutations in the solute carrier family 26, member 3 gene (SLC26A3, previously known as CLD or DRA) are responsible for the disease. Since the identification of the SLC26A3 gene and the determination of its genomic structure, altogether three founder and 17 private mutations have been characterized within miscellaneous ethnic groups. We screened for mutations in seven unrelated families with CLD. The diagnoses were confirmed by fecal chloride measurements. The combined PCR-SSCP and sequencing analyses revealed altogether seven novel mutations including two missense mutations (S206P, D468V), two splicing defects (IVS12-1G>C, IVS13-2delA), one nonsense mutation (Q436X), one insertion/deletion mutation (2104-2105delGGins29-bp), and an intragenic deletion of SLC26A3 exons 7 and 8. Two previously identified mutations were also found. This is the first report of rearrangement mutations in SLC26A3. Molecular features predisposing SLC26A3 for the two rearrangements may include repetitive elements and palindromic-like sequences. The increasingly wide diversity of SLC26A3 mutations suggests that mutations in the SLC26A3 gene may not be rare events.",

Eleven biallelic polymorphisms and seven short-tandem-repeat (STR) loci mapping on the nonrecombining portion of the human Y chromosome have been typed in men from northwestern Africa. Analysis of the biallelic markers, which represent probable unique events in human evolution, allowed us to characterize the stable backgrounds or haplogroups of Y chromosomes that prevail in this geographic region. Variation in the more rapidly mutating genetic markers (STRs) has been used both to estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor for STR variability within these stable backgrounds and to explore whether STR differentiation among haplogroups still retains information about their phylogeny. When analysis of molecular variance was used to study the apportionment of STR variation among both genetic backgrounds (i.e., those defined by haplogroups) and population backgrounds, we found STR variability to be clearly structured by haplogroups. More than 80% of the genetic variance was found among haplogroups, whereas only 3.72% of the genetic variation could be attributed to differences among populations-that is, genetic variability appears to be much more structured by lineage than by population. This was confirmed when two population samples from the Iberian Peninsula were added to the analysis. The deep structure of the genetic variation in old genealogical units (haplogroups) challenges a population-based perspective in the comprehension of human genome diversity. A population may be better understood as an association of lineages from a deep and population-independent gene genealogy, rather than as a complete evolutionary unit.",

                "text": "Mutations in CNGA3 impair trafficking or function of cone cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, resulting in achromatopsia. CNGA3 encodes the A-subunit of the cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel, which is a crucial component of the phototransduction cascade in cone outer segments. Mutations in the CNGA3 gene have been associated with complete and incomplete forms of achromatopsia (ACHR), a congenital, autosomal recessively inherited retinal disorder characterized by lack of color discrimination, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, and photophobia. Here we report the identification of three novel CNGA3 missense mutations in ACHR patients: c.682G>A (p.E228 K), c.1315C>T (p.R439W), and c.1405G>A (p.A469 T), and the detailed functional analyses of these new as well as five previously reported mutations (R283Q, T291R, F547L, G557R, and E590 K), in conjunction with clinical data of patients carrying these mutations, to establish genotype-phenotype correlations. The functional characterization of mutant CNGA3 channels was performed with calcium imaging and patch clamp recordings in a heterologous HEK293 cell expression system. Results were corroborated by immunostaining and colocalization experiments of the channel protein with the plasma membrane. Several mutations evoked pronounced alterations of the apparent cGMP sensitivity of mutant channels. These functional defects were fully or partially compensated by coexpressing the mutant CNGA3 subunit with the wild-type CNGB3 subunit for channels with the mutations R439W, A469 T, F547L, and E590 K. We could show that several mutant channels with agonist dose-response relationships similar to the wild-type exhibited severely impaired membrane targeting. In addition, this study presents the positive effect of reduced cell culture temperature on surface expression and functional performance of mutant CNG channels with protein folding or trafficking defects.",

Celtic languages are now spoken only on the Atlantic facade of Europe, mainly in Britain and Ireland, but were spoken more widely in western and central Europe until the collapse of the Roman Empire in the first millennium a.d. It has been common to couple archaeological evidence for the expansion of Iron Age elites in central Europe with the dispersal of these languages and of Celtic ethnicity and to posit a central European \"homeland\" for the Celtic peoples. More recently, however, archaeologists have questioned this \"migrationist\" view of Celtic ethnogenesis. The proposition of a central European ancestry should be testable by examining the distribution of genetic markers; however, although Y-chromosome patterns in Atlantic Europe show little evidence of central European influence, there has hitherto been insufficient data to confirm this by use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Here, we present both new mtDNA data from Ireland and a novel analysis of a greatly enlarged European mtDNA database. We show that mtDNA lineages, when analyzed in sufficiently large numbers, display patterns significantly similar to a large fraction of both Y-chromosome and autosomal variation. These multiple genetic marker systems indicate a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone, from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia, that dates back to the end of the last Ice Age.",

The cDNA sequence of the human gene shows 85% identity with the bovine peripherin gene and the rds (retinal degeneration slow) genes from mouse and rat. Mutations in the RDS gene have recently been implicated in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) in some families. Here we present evidence that the third exon of this gene is subject to polymorphic variation in humans. The three sequence alterations described in this paper give rise to amino acid substitutions. However, as these missense mutations also occur in the normal population they are not implicated as causing adRP. Interestingly such sequence variation is not found within other species examined including mouse and bovine. These intragenic polymorphisms will be of future potential value in studies to locate further disease causing mutations in adRP patients in the RDS gene.",

Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deleterious mutations in the RECQL4 gene on chromosome 8. The RECQL4 gene structure is unusual because it contains many small introns <100 bp. We describe a proband with RTS who has a novel 11-bp intronic deletion, and we show that this mutation results in a 66-bp intron too small for proper splicing. Constraint on intron size may represent a general mutational mechanism, since human-genome analysis reveals that approximately 15% of genes have introns <100 bp and are therefore susceptible to size constraint. Thus, monitoring of intron size may allow detection of mutations missed by exon-by-exon approaches.",

It has recently been shown that ancestors of New Guineans and Bougainville Islanders have inherited a proportion of their ancestry from Denisovans, an archaic hominin group from Siberia. However, only a sparse sampling of populations from Southeast Asia and Oceania were analyzed. Here, we quantify Denisova admixture in 33 additional populations from Asia and Oceania. Aboriginal Australians, Near Oceanians, Polynesians, Fijians, east Indonesians, and Mamanwa (a \"Negrito\" group from the Philippines) have all inherited genetic material from Denisovans, but mainland East Asians, western Indonesians, Jehai (a Negrito group from Malaysia), and Onge (a Negrito group from the Andaman Islands) have not. These results indicate that Denisova gene flow occurred into the common ancestors of New Guineans, Australians, and Mamanwa but not into the ancestors of the Jehai and Onge and suggest that relatives of present-day East Asians were not in Southeast Asia when the Denisova gene flow occurred. Our finding that descendants of the earliest inhabitants of Southeast Asia do not all harbor Denisova admixture is inconsistent with a history in which the Denisova interbreeding occurred in mainland Asia and then spread over Southeast Asia, leading to all its earliest modern human inhabitants. Instead, the data can be most parsimoniously explained if the Denisova gene flow occurred in Southeast Asia itself. Thus, archaic Denisovans must have lived over an extraordinarily broad geographic and ecological range, from Siberia to tropical Asia.",

Laron syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by resistance to growth hormone. We sought to determine the molecular basis of this condition in an Ecuadorean population with a high incidence of affected individuals. Growth hormone receptor gene sequences from an obligate heterozygote were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Only exon 6 revealed homo- and heteroduplexes on denaturing gradient gels. Sequencing revealed a substitution of guanine for adenine in the third position of codon 180 that did not change the amino acid encoded. Sequencing of the exon 6-exon 7 splice junction from RNA-polymerase chain reaction amplified cellular RNA of an affected individual revealed that the substitution activates a 5' splice site 24 nucleotides upstream from the normal exon 6-intron 6 boundary. Splicing in two probands' lymphoblasts occurred virtually exclusively at the abnormal 5' splice site created by the codon 180 substitution. Exon 6 sequences from 38 patients and 47 relatives were amplified and analyzed by sequencing or dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides. The substitution was detected in 74 of 76 Laron syndrome patients' GH-receptor alleles. All 26 parents and 12 of 21 unaffected siblings were heterozygous for this mutation. It was absent in 61 unrelated unaffected control individuals. We conclude that the codon 180 nucleotide substitution probably causes Laron syndrome as translation of the observed, abnormally spliced growth hormone receptor transcript would lead to the synthesis of a receptor protein with an 8 amino acid deletion from the extracellular domain.",

Alpha-dystroglycanopathies such as Walker Warburg syndrome represent an important subgroup of the muscular dystrophies that have been related to defective O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. In many patients, the underlying genetic etiology remains unsolved. Isolated muscular dystrophy has not been described in the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) caused by N-linked protein glycosylation defects. Here, we present a genetic N-glycosylation disorder with muscular dystrophy in the group of CDG type I. Extensive biochemical investigations revealed a strongly reduced dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) synthase activity. Sequencing of the three DPM subunits and complementation of DPM3-deficient CHO2.38 cells showed a pathogenic p.L85S missense mutation in the strongly conserved coiled-coil domain of DPM3 that tethers catalytic DPM1 to the ER membrane. Cotransfection experiments in CHO cells showed a reduced binding capacity of DPM3(L85S) for DPM1. Investigation of the four Dol-P-Man-dependent glycosylation pathways in the ER revealed strongly reduced O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan in a muscle biopsy, thereby explaining the clinical phenotype of muscular dystrophy. This mild Dol-P-Man biosynthesis defect due to DPM3 mutations is a cause for alpha-dystroglycanopathy, thereby bridging the congenital disorders of glycosylation with the dystroglycanopathies.",

In modern whole-genome scans, the use of stringent thresholds to control the genome-wide testing error distorts the estimation process, producing estimated effect sizes that may be on average far greater in magnitude than the true effect sizes. We introduce a method, based on the estimate of genetic effect and its standard error as reported by standard statistical software, to correct for this bias in case-control association studies. Our approach is widely applicable, is far easier to implement than competing approaches, and may often be applied to published studies without access to the original data. We evaluate the performance of our approach via extensive simulations for a range of genetic models, minor allele frequencies, and genetic effect sizes. Compared to the naive estimation procedure, our approach reduces the bias and the mean squared error, especially for modest effect sizes. We also develop a principled method to construct confidence intervals for the genetic effect that acknowledges the conditioning on statistical significance. Our approach is described in the specific context of odds ratios and logistic modeling but is more widely applicable. Application to recently published data sets demonstrates the relevance of our approach to modern genome scans.",

Microtia, a congenital deformity manifesting as an abnormally shaped or absent external ear, occurs in one out of 8,000-10,000 births. We ascertained a consanguineous Iranian family segregating with autosomal-recessive bilateral microtia, mixed symmetrical severe to profound hearing impairment, and partial cleft palate. Genome-wide linkage analysis localized the responsible gene to chromosome 7p14.3-p15.3 with a maximum multi-point LOD score of 4.17. In this region, homeobox genes from the HOXA cluster were the most interesting candidates. Subsequent DNA sequence analysis of the HOXA1 and HOXA2 homeobox genes from the candidate region identified an interesting HOXA2 homeodomain variant: a change in a highly conserved amino acid (p.Q186K). The variant was not found in 231 Iranian and 109 Belgian control samples. The critical contribution of HoxA2 for auditory-system development has already been shown in mouse models. We built a homology model to predict the effect of this mutation on the structure and DNA-binding activity of the homeodomain by using the program Modeler 8v2. In the model of the mutant homeodomain, the position of the mutant lysine side chain is consistently farther away from a nearby phosphate group; this altered position results in the loss of a hydrogen bond and affects the DNA-binding activity.",

Beta-thalassemia major is one of the commonest genetic disorders in South-East Asia. The spectrum of beta-thalassemia mutations in the various ethnic sub-populations on the island of Borneo is unknown. We studied 20 Dusun children from the East Malaysian state of Sabah (North Borneo) with a severe beta-thalassemia major phenotype, using a combination of Southern analysis, polymerase chain reaction analysis and direct sequencing. We found the children to be homozygous for a large deletion, which has a 5' breakpoint at position -4279 from the cap site of the beta-globin gene (HBB) with the 3' breakpoint located in a L1 family of repetitive sequences at an unknown distance from the beta-globin gene. This was similar to a recent finding of a large deletion causing beta-thalassemia first described in unrelated beta-thalassemia heterozygotes of Filipino descent. This report describes the first 20 families with homozygosity of the deletion causing a severe phenotype. It provides the first information on the molecular epidemiology of beta-thalassemia in Sabah. This finding has implications for the population genetics and preventative strategies for beta-thalassemia major for nearly 300 million individuals in South-East Asia.",

Association replication studies have a poor track record and, even when successful, often claim association with different markers, alleles, and phenotypes than those reported in the primary study. It is unknown whether these outcomes reflect genuine associations or false-positive results. A greater understanding of these observations is essential for genomewide association (GWA) studies, since they have the potential to identify multiple new associations that that will require external validation. Theoretically, a repeat association with precisely the same variant in an independent sample is the gold standard for replication, but testing additional variants is commonplace in replication studies. Finding different associated SNPs within the same gene or region as that originally identified is often reported as confirmatory evidence. Here, we compare the probability of replicating a gene or region under two commonly used marker-selection strategies: an \"exact\" approach that involves only the originally significant markers and a \"local\" approach that involves both the originally significant markers and others in the same region. When a region of high intermarker linkage disequilibrium is tested to replicate an initial finding that is only weak association with disease, the local approach is a good strategy. Otherwise, the most powerful and efficient strategy for replication involves testing only the initially identified variants. Association with a marker other than that originally identified can occur frequently, even in the presence of real effects in a low-powered replication study, and instances of such association increase as the number of included variants increases. Our results provide a basis for the design and interpretation of GWA replication studies and point to the importance of a clear distinction between fine mapping and replication after GWA.",

Mutation screening of the PRPS1 gene in this family and in the three previously reported DFN2 families identified four different missense mutations in PRPS1. These mutations result in a loss of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase 1 activity, as was shown in silico by structural analysis and was shown in vitro by enzymatic activity assays in erythrocytes and fibroblasts from patients. By in situ hybridization, we demonstrate expression of Prps1 in murine vestibular and cochlea hair cells, with continuous expression in hair cells and postnatal expression in the spiral ganglion.

De novo LINE-1 (long interspersed element-1, or L1) retrotransposition events are responsible for approximately 1/1,000 disease-causing mutations in humans. Previously, L1.2 was identified as the likely progenitor of a mutagenic insertion in the factor VIII gene in a patient with hemophilia A. It subsequently was shown to be one of a small number of active L1s in the human genome. Here, we demonstrate that L1.2 is present at an intermediate insertion allele frequency in worldwide human populations and that common alleles (L1.2A and L1.2B) exhibit an approximately 16-fold difference in their ability to retrotranspose in cultured human HeLa cells. Chimera analysis revealed that two amino acid substitutions (S1259L and I1220M) downstream of the conserved cysteine-rich motif in L1 open reading frame 2 are largely responsible for the observed reduction in L1.2A retrotransposition efficiency. Thus, common L1 alleles can vary widely in their retrotransposition potential. We propose that such allelic heterogeneity can influence the potential L1 mutational load present in an individual genome.",

                "text": "Divergence between human populations estimated from linkage disequilibrium. Observed linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genetic markers in different populations descended independently from a common ancestral population can be used to estimate their absolute time of divergence, because the correlation of LD between populations will be reduced each generation by an amount that, approximately, depends only on the recombination rate between markers. Although drift leads to divergence in allele frequencies, it has less effect on divergence in LD values. We derived the relationship between LD and time of divergence and verified it with coalescent simulations. We then used HapMap Phase II data to estimate time of divergence between human populations. Summed over large numbers of pairs of loci, we find a positive correlation of LD between African and non-African populations at levels of up to approximately 0.3 cM. We estimate that the observed correlation of LD is consistent with an effective separation time of approximately 1,000 generations or approximately 25,000 years before present. The most likely explanation for such relatively low separation times is the existence of substantial levels of migration between populations after the initial separation. Theory and results from coalescent simulations confirm that low levels of migration can lead to a downward bias in the estimate of separation time.",

Studies have demonstrated that natural variation in the expression level of genes at baseline is extensive, and the determinants of this variation can be mapped by a genetic-linkage approach. In this study, we used lymphoblastoid cells to explore the variation in radiation-induced transcriptional changes. We found that, among normal individuals, there is extensive variation in transcriptional response to radiation exposure. By studying monozygotic twins, we demonstrated that there is evidence of a heritable component to this variation. The postradiation variation in the expression level of several genes, including the ferredoxin reductase gene (FDXR) and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A gene (CDKN1A), is significantly greater (P<.001) among twin pairs than within twin pairs. The induction of FDXR by radiation showed a bimodal distribution. Our findings have important implications for understanding the genetic basis of radiation response, which has remained largely unknown due to the lack of family material needed for genetic studies. Our approach, which uses expression phenotypes in cell lines, allows us to expose cells from family members to radiation. Similar study design can be applied to dissect the genetic basis of other complex human traits.",

Synapsin II has been proposed as a candidate gene for vulnerability to schizophrenia on the basis of its function and its location in a region of the genome implicated by linkage studies in families with schizophrenia. We recently reported positive association of synapsin II with schizophrenia in a case-control study (Chen et al. 2004). However, since case-control analyses can generate false-positive results in the presence of minor degrees of population stratification, we have performed a replication study in 366 additional Han Chinese probands and their parents by use of analyses of transmission/disequilibrium for three in/del markers and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Positive association was observed for rs2307981 (P =.02), rs2308169 (P =.005), rs308963 (P =.002), rs795009 (P =.02), and rs2307973 (P =.02). For transmission of six-marker haplotypes, the global P value was.0000016 (5 degrees of freedom), principally because of overtransmission of the most common haplotype, CAA/-/G/T/C/- (frequency 53.6%; chi (2) = 20.8; P =.0000051). This confirms our previous study and provides further support for the role of synapsin II variants in susceptibility to schizophrenia.",

The quest to explain demographic history during the early part of human evolution has been limited because of the scarce paleoanthropological record from the Middle Stone Age. To shed light on the structure of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeny at the dawn of Homo sapiens, we constructed a matrilineal tree composed of 624 complete mtDNA genomes from sub-Saharan Hg L lineages. We paid particular attention to the Khoi and San (Khoisan) people of South Africa because they are considered to be a unique relic of hunter-gatherer lifestyle and to carry paternal and maternal lineages belonging to the deepest clades known among modern humans. Both the tree phylogeny and coalescence calculations suggest that Khoisan matrilineal ancestry diverged from the rest of the human mtDNA pool 90,000-150,000 years before present (ybp) and that at least five additional, currently extant maternal lineages existed during this period in parallel. Furthermore, we estimate that a minimum of 40 other evolutionarily successful lineages flourished in sub-Saharan Africa during the period of modern human dispersal out of Africa approximately 60,000-70,000 ybp. Only much later, at the beginning of the Late Stone Age, about 40,000 ybp, did introgression of additional lineages occur into the Khoisan mtDNA pool. This process was further accelerated during the recent Bantu expansions. Our results suggest that the early settlement of humans in Africa was already matrilineally structured and involved small, separately evolving isolated populations.",

We determined previously that the selectable marker pSV2neo is preferentially inserted into chromosomal fragile sites in human x hamster hybrid cells in the presence of an agent (aphidicolin) that induces fragile-site expression. In contrast, cells transfected without fragile-site induction showed an essentially random integration pattern. To determine whether the integration of marker DNA at fragile sites affects the frequency of fragile-site expression, the parental hybrid and three transfectants (two with pSV2neo integrated at the fragile site at 3p14.2 [FRA3B] and specific hamster fragile sites [chromosome 1, bands q26-31, or mar2, bands q11-13] and one with pSV2neo integrated at sites that are not fragile sites) were treated with aphidicolin. After 24 h the two cell lines with plasmid integration at FRA3B showed structural rearrangements at that site; these rearrangements accounted for 43%-67% of the total deletions and translocations observed. Structural rearrangements were not observed in the parental cell line. After 5 d aphidicolin treatment, the observed excess in frequency of structural rearrangements at FRA3B in the cell lines with pSV2neo integration at 3p14 over that in the two lines without FRA3B integration was less dramatic, but nonetheless significant. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of these cells, using a biotin-labeled pSV2neo probe, showed results consistent with the gross rearrangements detected cytogenetically in the lines with FRA3B integration; however, the pSV2neo sequences were frequently deleted concomitantly with translocations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We present the results of extensive simulations that emulate the development and distribution of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a gene locus that is phenotypically stratified into two classes (disease phenotype and wild-type phenotype). Our approach, based on coalescence theory, allows an explicit modeling of the demographic history of the population without conditioning on the age of the mutation, and serves as an efficient tool to carry out simulations. More specifically, we compare the influence that a constant population size or an exponentially growing population has on the amount of LD. These results indicate that attempts to locate single disease genes are most likely successful in small and constant populations. On the other hand, if we consider an exponentially growing population that started to expand from an initially constant population of reasonable size, then our simulations indicate a lower success rate. The power to detect association is enhanced if haplotypes constructed from several SNPs are used as markers. The versatility of the coalescence approach also allows the analysis of other relevant factors that influence the chances that a disease gene will be located. We show that several alleles leading to the same disease have no substantial influence on the amount of LD, as long as the differences between the disease-causing alleles are confined to the same region of the gene locus and as long as each allele occurs in an appreciable frequency. Our simulations indicate that mapping of less-frequent diseases is more likely to be successful. Moreover, we show that successful attempts to map complex diseases depend crucially on the phenotype-genotype correlations of all alleles at the disease locus. An analysis of lipoprotein lipase data indicates that our simulations capture the major features of LD occurring in biological data.",

                "text": "The human gene encoding acetylcholinesterase is located on the long arm of chromosome 7. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a secreted enzyme essential for regulating cholinergic neurotransmission at neuronal and neuromuscular synapses. In view of the altered expression of AChE in some central neurological and neuromuscular disorders with a probable genetic basis, we have identified the chromosomal location of the gene encoding AChE. Chromosomal in situ suppression hybridization analysis revealed a single gene to be at 7q22, a result which was confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA from a human/hamster somatic cell hybrid containing a single human chromosome 7. The AChE gene thus maps to the same region in which frequent nonrandom chromosome 7 deletions occur in leukemias of myeloid cell precursors known to express the enzyme during normal differentiation.",

Imprinting in 15q11-q13 is controlled by a bipartite imprinting center (IC), which maps to the SNURF-SNRPN locus. Deletions of the exon 1 region impair the establishment or maintenance of the paternal imprint and can cause Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Deletions of a region 35 kb upstream of exon 1 impair maternal imprinting and can cause Angelman syndrome (AS). So far, in all affected sibs with an imprinting defect, an inherited IC deletion was identified. We report on two sibs with AS who do not have an IC deletion but instead have a 1-1.5 Mb inversion separating the two IC elements. The inversion is transmitted silently through the male germline but impairs maternal imprinting after transmission through the female germline. Our findings suggest that the close proximity and/or the correct orientation of the two IC elements are/is necessary for the establishment of a maternal imprint.",

Relative to genomes of other sequenced organisms, the human genome appears particularly enriched for large, highly homologous segmental duplications (> or =90% sequence identity and > or =10 kbp in length). The molecular basis for this enrichment is unknown. We sought to gain insight into the mechanism of origin, by systematically examining sequence features at the junctions of duplications. We analyzed 9,464 junctions within regions of high-quality finished sequence from a genomewide set of 2,366 duplication alignments. We observed a highly significant (P<.0001) enrichment of Alu short interspersed element (SINE) sequences near or within the junction. Twenty-seven percent of all segmental duplications terminated within an Alu repeat. The Alu junction enrichment was most pronounced for interspersed segmental duplications separated by > or =1 Mb of intervening sequence. Alu elements at the junctions showed higher levels of divergence, consistent with Alu-Alu-mediated recombination events. When we classified Alu elements into major subfamilies, younger elements (AluY and AluS) accounted for the enrichment, whereas the oldest primate family (AluJ) showed no enrichment. We propose that the primate-specific burst of Alu retroposition activity (which occurred 35-40 million years ago) sensitized the ancestral human genome for Alu-Alu-mediated recombination events, which, in turn, initiated the expansion of gene-rich segmental duplications and their subsequent role in nonallelic homologous recombination.",

In many disease genes, a substantial fraction of all rare variants detected cannot yet be used for genetic counselling because of uncertainty about their association with disease. One approach to the characterization of these unclassified variants is the analysis of patterns of cosegregation with disease in affected carrier families. Petersen et al. previously provided a simplistic Bayesian method for evaluation of causality of such sequence variants. In the present report, we propose a more general method based on the full pedigree likelihood, and we show that the use of this method can provide more accurate and informative assessment of causality than could the previous method. We further show that it is important that the pedigree information be as complete as possible and that the distinction be made between unaffected individuals and those of unknown phenotype.",

In the present paper, biospecific interaction analysis (BIA) was performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and biosensor technologies to detect the Trp1282Ter mutation (W1282X) of the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. We first immobilized on a SA5 sensor chip a single-stranded biotinylated oligonucleotide containing the sequence involved in this mutation, and the efficiency of hybridization of oligonucleotide probes differing in length was determined. Second, we immobilized on different SA5 sensor chips biotinylated polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) products from a normal subject as well as from heterozygous and homozygous W1282X samples. The results obtained show that both allele-specific 10- and 12-mer oligonucleotides are suitable probes to detect W1282X mutations of the cystic fibrosis gene under standard BIA experimental conditions. During the association phase performed at 25 degrees C, discrimination between mismatched and full matched hybrids was readily and reproducibly observed by using the 10-mer W1282X probes. By contrast, when the 12-mer DNA probes were employed, discrimination between mismatched and full matched hybrids was observed during the dissociation phase. Taken together, the results presented suggest that BIA is an easy, speedy, and automatable approach to detect point mutations leading to cystic fibrosis. By this procedure, it is possible to perform real-time monitoring of hybridization between target single stranded PCR products obtained by using as substrates DNA isolated from normal or heterozygous subjects, and homozygous W1282X CF samples and oligonucleotide probes, therefore enabling a one-step, non-radioactive protocol to perform diagnosis.",

Admixture mapping requires a genomewide panel of relatively evenly spaced markers that can distinguish the ancestral origins of chromosomal segments in admixed individuals. Through use of the results of the International HapMap Project and specific selection criteria, the current study has examined the ability of selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to extract continental ancestry information in African American subjects and to explore parameters for admixture mapping. Genotyping of two linguistically diverse West African populations (Bini and Kanuri Nigerians, who are Niger-Congo [Bantu] and Nilo-Saharan speakers, respectively), European Americans, and African Americans validated a genomewide set of >4,000 SNP ancestry-informative markers with mean and median F(ST) values >0.59 and mean and median Fisher's information content >2.5. This set of SNPs extracted a larger amount of ancestry information in African Americans than previously reported SNP panels and provides nearly uniform coverage of the genome. Moreover, in the current study, simulations show that this more informative panel improves power for admixture mapping in African Americans when ethnicity risk ratios are modest. This is particularly important in the application of admixture mapping in complex genetic diseases for which only modest ethnicity risk ratios of relevant susceptibility genes are expected.",

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a monogenic inherited disorder of the heme biosynthetic pathway due to ferrochelatase (FC) deficiency. EPP is generally considered to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance, although autosomal recessive inheritance has been documented at the enzymatic and molecular level in some families. In the dominant form of EPP, statistical analysis of FC activities documented a significantly lower mean value in patients than in asymptomatic carriers, suggesting a more complex mode of inheritance. To account for these findings, we tested a multiallelic inheritance model in one EPP family in which the enzymatic data were compatible with this hypothesis. In this EPP family, the specific FC gene mutation was an exon 10 skipping (delta Ex10), resulting from a G deletion within the exon 10 consensus splice donor site. The segregation of all FC alleles within the family was followed using the delta Ex10 mutation and a new intragenic dimorphism (1520 C/T). mRNAs transcribed from each FC allele were then subjected to relative quantification by a primer extension assay and to absolute quantification by a ribonuclease protection assay. The data support the hypothesis that in this family the EPP phenotype results from the coinheritance of a low output normal FC allele and a mutant delta Ex10 allele.",

The genotyping of closely spaced single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers frequently yields highly correlated data, owing to extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers. The extent of LD varies widely across the genome and drives the number of frequent haplotypes observed in small regions. Several studies have illustrated the possibility that LD or haplotype data could be used to select a subset of SNPs that optimize the information retained in a genomic region while reducing the genotyping effort and simplifying the analysis. We propose a method based on the spectral decomposition of the matrices of pairwise LD between markers, and we select markers on the basis of their contributions to the total genetic variation. We also modify Clayton's \"haplotype tagging SNP\" selection method, which utilizes haplotype information. For both methods, we propose sliding window-based algorithms that allow the methods to be applied to large chromosomal regions. Our procedures require genotype information about a small number of individuals for an initial set of SNPs and selection of an optimum subset of SNPs that could be efficiently genotyped on larger numbers of samples while retaining most of the genetic variation in samples. We identify suitable parameter combinations for the procedures, and we show that a sample size of 50-100 individuals achieves consistent results in studies of simulated data sets in linkage equilibrium and LD. When applied to experimental data sets, both procedures were similarly effective at reducing the genotyping requirement while maintaining the genetic information content throughout the regions. We also show that haplotype-association results that Hosking et al. obtained near CYP2D6 were almost identical before and after marker selection.",

Rearrangements of the acrocentric chromosomes (Robertsonian translocations and isochromosomes) are associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy. Given this, and the large number of reported cases of uniparental disomy (UPD) associated with an acrocentric rearrangement, carriers are presumed to be at risk for UPD. However, an accurate risk estimate for UPD associated with these rearrangements is lacking. A total of 174 prenatally identified acrocentric rearrangements, including both Robertsonian translocations and isochromosomes, were studied prospectively to identify UPD for the chromosomes involved in the rearrangements. The overall goal of the study was to provide an estimate of the risk of UPD associated with nonhomologous Robertsonian translocations and homologous acrocentric rearrangements. Of the 168 nonhomologous Robertsonian translocations studied, one showed UPD for chromosome 13, providing a risk estimate of 0.6%. Four of the six homologous acrocentric rearrangements showed UPD, providing a risk estimate of 66%. These cases have also allowed delineation of the mechanisms involved in producing UPD unique to Robertsonian translocations. Given the relatively high risk for UPD in prenatally identified Robertsonian translocations and isochromosomes, UPD testing should be considered, especially for cases involving the acrocentric chromosomes 14 and 15, in which UPD is associated with adverse clinical outcomes.",

Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS) is thought to be caused by mutations occurring in the widely expressed serine/threonine protein kinase named LKB1/STK11. Recent work has led to the identification of four mutants (R304W, I177N, K175-D176del, L263fsX286) and two novel aberrant LKB1/STK11 cDNA isoforms (r291-464del, r485-1283del) in a group of PJS Italian patients. Three of the four mutations only change 1 or 2 amino acids in the LKB1/STK11 catalytic domain. Here we demonstrate that all six LKB1/STK11 variants analysed are completely inactive in vitro as they were unable to autophosphorylate at Thr336, the major LKB1/STK11 autophosphorylation site, and to phosphorylate the p53 tumour suppressor protein. We also show that 5 out of the 6 variants are entirely localised in the nucleus in contrast to the wild type LKB1/STK11, which is detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Finally we demonstrate that all 6 LKB1/STK11 variants, in contrast to wild type LKB1/STK11, are unable to suppress the growth of melanoma G361 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the LKB1 mutations investigated in this study lead to the loss of serine/threonine kinase activity and are therefore likely to be the primary cause of PJS development in the patients that they were isolated from.",

X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) is a severe form of inherited progressive retinal degeneration. The RP3 (retinitis pigmentosa type 3) locus at Xp21.1 is believed to account for the disease in the majority of XLRP families. Linkage analysis and identification of patients with chromosomal deletion have refined the location of the RP3 locus and recently have led to the cloning of the RPGR (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator) gene, which has been shown to be mutated in 10%-15% of XLRP patients. In order to systematically characterize the RPGR mutations, we identified 11 retinitis pigmentosa type III (RP3) families by haplotype analysis. Sequence analysis of the PCR-amplified genomic DNA from patients representing these RP3 families did not reveal any causative mutation in RPGR exons 2-19, spanning >98% of the coding region. In patients from two families, we identified transition mutations in the intron region near splice sites (IVS10+3 and IVS13-8). RNA analysis showed that both splice-site mutations resulted in the generation of aberrant RPGR transcripts. Our results support the hypothesis that mutations in the reported RPGR gene are not a common defect in the RP3 subtype of XLRP and that a majority of causative mutations may reside either in as yet unidentified RPGR exons or in another nearby gene at Xp21.1.",

Admixture mapping is an economical and powerful approach for localizing disease genes in populations of recently mixed ancestry and has proven successful in African Americans. The method holds equal promise for Latinos, who typically inherit a mix of European, Native American, and African ancestry. However, admixture mapping in Latinos has not been practical because of the lack of a map of ancestry-informative markers validated in Native American and other populations. To address this, we screened multiple databases, containing millions of markers, to identify 4,186 markers that were putatively informative for determining the ancestry of chromosomal segments in Latino populations. We experimentally validated each of these markers in at least 232 new Latino, European, Native American, and African samples, and we selected a subset of 1,649 markers to form an admixture map. An advantage of our strategy is that we focused our map on markers distinguishing Native American from other ancestries and restricted it to markers with very similar frequencies in Europeans and Africans, which decreased the number of markers needed and minimized the possibility of false disease associations. We evaluated the effectiveness of our map for localizing disease genes in four Latino populations from both North and South America.",

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is a genetic disorder resulting in fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular myocytes and consequent ventricular arrhythmias. Heterozygous mutations in PKP2 encoding plakophilin-2 have previously been reported to cause dominant ARVD with reduced penetrance. We report the first case of recessive ARVD caused by mutations in PKP2. Candidate gene analysis in a typical proband with this disorder identified a novel homozygous mutation in PKP2 (c.[2484C>T]+[2484C>T]), which is predicted to be translationally silent (p.Gly828). Analysis of the proband's mRNA, however, shows that this mutation causes predominantly cryptic splicing, with a 7-nucleotide deletion in exon 12. The ensuing frame shift disrupts the last 54 amino acids of plakophilin-2 and extends the open reading frame by 145 nucleotides (48 amino acids) into the 3' untranslated region. Haplotype analysis demonstrates the absence of remote consanguinity. Heterozygous family members produce approximately 60% of properly spliced PKP2 and do not have manifestations of ARVD. Further analysis of PKP2 mRNA sequence revealed two additional alternatively spliced transcripts. The possibility of cryptic or alternative splicing should be considered with identification of apparently synonymous nucleotide substitutions in this gene.",

The PCR technique was used to analyze the DXYS17 locus in the pseudoautosomal region of the X and the Y chromosomes. Analysis on an automated DNA sequencer allowed for sensitive and highly accurate typing of 16 different alleles with a size between 480 and 1,100 bp. Two DXYS17 alleles migrated with the same size on agarose or denaturing polyacrylamide gels but with different mobilities on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Sequence analysis showed that, while an identical number of repeats were present in both alleles, differences in the composition of the units were observed. The origin of these differences was found in the 28- and 33-bp units, which only had a specific repeat pattern at the 5' and 3' ends of the region. The genotype distribution for DXYS17 in a Caucasian population did not deviate from the values expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. However, the frequency of one allele and one genotype was significantly different between males and females. Segregation analysis showed that this difference was the result of a nonrandom distribution of certain alleles on the sex chromosomes in males.",

The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of neuronal migration/neurodegenerative disorders that arise from defects in PEX genes. A major subgroup of the PBDs includes Zellweger syndrome (ZS), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile Refsum disease (IRD). These three disorders represent a clinical continuum with Zellweger syndrome the most severe. Mutations in the PEX1 gene, which encodes a protein of the AAA ATPase family involved in peroxisome matrix protein import, account for the genetic defect in more than half of the patients in this PBD subgroup. We report here on the results of PEX1 mutation detection in an Australasian cohort of PEX1-deficient PBD patients. This screen has identified five novel mutations, including nonsense mutations in exons 14 and 19 and single nucleotide deletions in exons 5 and 18. Significantly, the allele carrying the exon 18 frameshift mutation is present at moderately high frequency (approx. 10%) in this patient cohort. The fifth mutation is a missense mutation (R798G) that attenuates, but does not abolish PEX1 function. We have evaluated the cellular impact of these novel mutations, along with that of the two most common PEX1 mutations (c.2097-2098insT and G843D), in PBD patients by determining the levels of PEX1 mRNA, PEX1 protein, and peroxisome protein import. The findings are consistent with a close correlation between cellular phenotype, disease severity, and PEX1 genotype.",

Mutations in the GLI3 zinc-finger transcription factor gene cause Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) and Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS), which are variable but distinct clinical entities. We hypothesized that GLI3 mutations that predict a truncated functional repressor protein cause PHS and that functional haploinsufficiency of GLI3 causes GCPS. To test these hypotheses, we screened patients with PHS and GCPS for GLI3 mutations. The patient group consisted of 135 individuals: 89 patients with GCPS and 46 patients with PHS. We detected 47 pathological mutations (among 60 probands); when these were combined with previously published mutations, two genotype-phenotype correlations were evident. First, GCPS was caused by many types of alterations, including translocations, large deletions, exonic deletions and duplications, small in-frame deletions, and missense, frameshift/nonsense, and splicing mutations. In contrast, PHS was caused only by frameshift/nonsense and splicing mutations. Second, among the frameshift/nonsense mutations, there was a clear genotype-phenotype correlation. Mutations in the first third of the gene (from open reading frame [ORF] nucleotides [nt] 1-1997) caused GCPS, and mutations in the second third of the gene (from ORF nt 1998-3481) caused primarily PHS. Surprisingly, there were 12 mutations in patients with GCPS in the 3' third of the gene (after ORF nt 3481), and no patients with PHS had mutations in this region. These results demonstrate a robust correlation of genotype and phenotype for GLI3 mutations and strongly support the hypothesis that these two allelic disorders have distinct modes of pathogenesis.",

The interval-mapping procedure of Fulker and Cardon for analysis of a quantitative-trait loci (QTL) is extended for application to selected samples of sib pairs. Phenotypic selection of sib pairs, which is known to yield striking increases in power when a single marker is used, provides further increases in power when the interval-mapping approach is used. The greatest benefits of the combined approach are apparent with coarse maps, where QTLs of relatively modest (15%-20%) heritability can be detected with widely spaced markers (40-60 cM apart) in reasonably sized sibling samples. Useful information concerning QTL location is afforded by interval mapping in both selected and unselected samples.",

A single-nucleotide variant, C/T(-13910), located 14 kb upstream of the lactase gene (LCT), has been shown to be completely correlated with lactase persistence (LP) in northern Europeans. Here, we analyzed the background of the alleles carrying the critical variant in 1,611 DNA samples from 37 populations. Our data show that the T(-13910) variant is found on two different, highly divergent haplotype backgrounds in the global populations. The first is the most common LP haplotype (LP H98) present in all populations analyzed, whereas the others (LP H8-H12), which originate from the same ancestral allelic haplotype, are found in geographically restricted populations living west of the Urals and north of the Caucasus. The global distribution pattern of LP T(-13910) H98 supports the Caucasian origin of this allele. Age estimates based on different mathematical models show that the common LP T(-13910) H98 allele (approximately 5,000-12,000 years old) is relatively older than the other geographically restricted LP alleles (approximately 1,400-3,000 years old). Our data about global allelic haplotypes of the lactose-tolerance variant imply that the T(-13910) allele has been independently introduced more than once and that there is a still-ongoing process of convergent evolution of the LP alleles in humans.",
