Most studies focus on the identification of differentially expressed genes in tissues at different tumor stages or on the identification of new tumor subclasses and their diagnostic gene expression signatures [1-6]. In contrast, much less is known about the influence of chromosomal neighborhood on gene expression in tumors.\n\nIn tumors different genetic mechanisms are known to affect gene expression in wider chromosomal regions. Chromosomal aberrations, like homozygous and heterozygous deletions or amplifications, alter the DNA copy number of large genomic regions or even whole chromosome arms, leading to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes [7,8] or to activation of oncogenes. Another genetic phenomenon that is assumed to have drastic effects on gene expression in cancer cells is the aberrant alteration of chromatin structure. Methylation of genomic DNA, histone acetylation, and histone methylation are assumed to have a large impact on the accessibility of DNA for transcription initiation [9]. Such epigenetic mechanisms can affect large genomic regions by possibly either silencing or activating large arrays of genes. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing chromatin assembly and disassembly are only beginning to emerge. So far, due to methodological limitations it has not been possible to study the role of such phenomena for gene expression in cancer cells on a genome-wide scale. Nevertheless, evidence from single-gene focused studies suggests that chromatin regulation does play an important role in tumorigenesis [10,11].\n\nRegardless of which mechanism leads to coordinated expression in chromosomal domains, solely the knowledge about such domains is of considerable importance. Such knowledge could guide further studies that aim to differentiate between those differentially expressed genes that cause tumorigenesis and are the primary targets of regional genomic aberrations and those that are rather the outcome than the cause of tumor development. The rationale for the existence of such piggy-back genes is the following. The silencing of genes at close distance to a known tumor suppressor gene (TSGs) would in many cases just be a side effect of TSG silencing. A similar reasoning applies to oncogenes that can be activated by increased expression: genes that are co-amplified could also be expressed at higher levels although they do not contribute to tumorigenesis. Typical searches for differentially expressed genes by microarrays usually ignore such piggy-back effects. This may lead to the identification of large numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which only a smaller fraction is causative for tumor development.\n\n",

                "text": "With respect to the localisation in the colorectal tract, tumours of the rectosigmoid and rectum more frequently harboured truncating APC mutations when compared to colon tumours (P = 0.001), as shown in table 3. Rectosigmoid and rectal tumours have a relatively higher frequency of K-ras mutations in codons 12 and 13 when compared to colon tumours (P = 0.05) (Table 3). Nine per cent of tumours showed hMLH1 deficiency, as determined by immunohistochemistry (Figure 2). Tumours lacking hMLH1 expression occur almost exclusively in the proximal colon (P < 0.001) and relatively more frequently show poor differentiation or are undifferentiated (P < 0.001) when compared to tumours with hMLH1 expression (Table 3).\n\nNext, we compared the patient and tumour characteristics of tumours harbouring a truncating APC and/or an activating K-ras mutation to those of tumours without hMLH1 expression, and these results are presented in table 4. Patients harbouring hMLH1 deficient tumours were slightly older when diagnosed with colorectal cancer (69.3 yr (68.0\u201370.5) versus 67.8 (67.4\u201368.3), P = 0.03), were relatively less frequently men (40% versus 58%, P = 0.02). Tumours without hMLH1 expression occurred relatively more frequently in the proximal colon (P < 0.001) and relatively more frequently showed poor differentiation or are undifferentiated (P < 0.001).\n\nWhen comparing tumours with a missense (but not a truncating) mutation in APC to tumours with a truncating mutation in APC, missense mutations occurred relatively more frequently in the colon (P = 0.002), less often also harboured an activating K-ras mutation (P = 0.004), and more often also lacked hMLH1 expression (P < 0.001). No differences were observed with regard to age at diagnosis, gender, Dukes' stage or tumour differentiation (data not shown).\n\nFinally, to assess agreement between hMLH1 expression and microsatellite instability, both hMLH1 expression and BAT-26 were analysed in 162 tumours. All tumours that had normal BAT-26, also showed hMLH1 expression. Fourteen tumours with unstable BAT-26 also lacked hMLH1 expression, and two tumours with unstable BAT-26 were found to express hMLH1, which demonstrates a high agreement between these molecular features of mismatch repair deficiency.\n\n",

The most 5' situated pathogenic germ line APC mutation identified in this study, in codon 24 of exon 1 (c.70C > T), was detected when analyzing patient C157. This may be the most 5' location of any mutation detected in the coding region of APC (Figure 1[38]). Codon 24 is within the oligomerization domain at the N-terminus of APC, encoded by amino acids 6\u201357 [39]. The most 3' situated mutation identified in the present study (C159) is a frameshift at codon 1920. The most frequently found mutation was the well-known c.3927_3931del AAAGA (amino acid position 1309) mutation detected in 10 out of the 95 patients. The recurrent mutation c.3183_3187delACAAA (amino acid 1061) was found in four patients. The frequency of de novo mutation cases was 16% which is lower than the estimation of 20\u201325% reported by Bisgaard et al [40]. The most frequent mutation occurring de novo was c.3927_3931del AAAGA (3 out of 10 cases, 30%) compared with mutations at other sites in the gene (7 out of 55 cases, 12.7%).\n\nGenotype-phenotype\n\nThe clinical characterization of the APC-mutation positive patients is summarized in Additional file 1 and the characterization of APC- and MUTYH-mutation negative patients are presented in Table 1. Probands with mutations between codon 1250 and 1468 in the APC gene, which predict a severe course of the colorectal polyposis [41] were significantly younger at diagnosis compared with those with mutations outside this region and seem to have more colorectal polyps. Despite a lower fraction of patients with dense polyposis among those with mutations outside codon 1250\u20131464, CRC at diagnosis occurred often. High age at diagnosis can probably explain the relatively high risk of having CRC at diagnosis in this subgroup of probands. Early detection because of short patients and delay by doctors may explain the relatively low fraction of patients having CRC at diagnosis among those where the site of the mutation and clinical features indicate a more severe phenotype. Overall, the risk for a proband of having a CRC at diagnosis was lower than previously reported by Bj\u00f6rk et al [33] where 67% of the probands diagnosed between 1912 and 1996 had CRC at diagnosis. In this previous study a continued decrease in CRC morbidity among probands was seen over time being 48% in the last period studied (1977\u20131996). In this current study 84% (27 out of 32) of the probands were diagnosed with FAP during that period or later (after 1976). Nine of the 27 (33%) probands had CRC at diagnosis, which indicates a continued decrease in CRC at diagnosis over time. This is in agreement with our other findings. Except for more rapid detection of symptomatic patients with classical FAP in recent years, a shift over time of probands being diagnosed with FAP towards a less-severe phenotype, might explain the decrease in CRC morbidity.\n\n",

The use of mRNA analyses has been crucial in order to detect and characterize splice variants and also to complement MLPA analyses. The MLPA method has improved and simplified the screening procedure significantly, but it is important to remember the limits of the method, which in our study is exemplified by a possible translocation that is not detectable by MLPA. Furthermore, the need to detect elusive APC changes such as mosaicism, which are not easily identified using standard techniques, remains. Such APC mutations may be the cause of some of the so-far unresolved de novo cases of attenuated or atypical FAP. Clinical data from this study indicate that the risk of having CRC at diagnosis among probands with mutations outside the region codon 1250\u20131464, although exhibiting a less-severe phenotype, is high indicating that age at diagnosis rather than severity of the disease predicts CRC morbidity. Early detection of probands contributes to the decrease in overall CRC morbidity seen in FAP in recent years.\n\n",

The plots are made to be easily comparable with whole-genome CGH plots (like e.g. those in Kn\u00f6sel et al. [21]) Further details of plot construction are described in the methods section.\n\nIndividual chromosomal islands of up- or down-regulation.\n\nThese are condensed results of the ChARM analyses: overlapping regions with evidence for up- or down-regulation from various analyses of different cross-correlation window sizes have been fused into single regions. The original ChARM output including p values for each region and additional annotation can be found in Additional file 1. Hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes are indicated along with their OMIM ID. Gene symbols are official or provisional HUGO symbols if available, otherwise names of Unigene clusters.

The second column gives the number of genes on a particular chromosome that were included in our analysis.

There have been numerous reports of copy number gains of chromosome 8q in CRC [18,21,23,25] which suggests a possible mechanism leading to over-expression in our patients. The known blood cell oncogene LYN is located in this interval and it is up-regulated in several of our tumor samples. It has been reported before that LYN is expressed in colorectal tumors [26]. The concerted up-regulation of LYN along with other genes in this region suggests a role for LYN in CRC. Another interesting gene in this interval is PLAG1 (pleomorphic adenoma gene 1) for which chromosomal aberrations have been described that lead to over-expression in salivary gland tumors [27,28]. No informative expression measures were obtained for the MOS protein kinase gene which is located between RPS20 and PLAG1, although this may be due to technical limitations. Genes encoding components of the translation machinery, the mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRPL15 and cytosolic ribosomal proteins RPL7 and RPS20, are located in this region, highlighting the need for enhanced translation in cancer cells. The concomitant down-regulation of the TOX and ANKTM1 genes in many patients in an environment of transcriptional activation is remarkable, but the functional significance remains unclear. Buffart et al. have reported amplifications of 8q11-q24 in metastasizing CRC [29], highlighting a possible mechanism for gain of expression in this region. In summary, our analysis suggests that chromosomal region 8q12.1 is a candidate target region for genetic alterations that lead to over-expression in CRC.\n\n",

Microsatellites are inherited according to Mendelian rules like any other genetic markers. Each progenitor pass one of its two alleles to its offspring and by definition, the alleles present in the proband's tumor tissue but absent in his progenitors are the result of somatic mutation.\n\nThree out of five microsatellite markers (BAT-25, BAT-26 and D5S346) presented alleles in the proband's primary tumor (T') and its metastasis (T\") different from those inherited from his parents. This observation suggested a dysfunction of the mismatch repair system and the tumor was classified as high frequency MSI (MSI-H) according to the NCI workshop [12]. Direct sequencing of the hMSH2 and hMLH1 genes was indicated, detecting a novel germline mutation, a c.1864C>A transversion in exon 12 of hMSH2 gene at the heterozygous state (fig. 3) leading to a proline 622 to threonine (p.Pro622Thr) amino acid substitution.

This difference in the distribution could be a cause for the wide range in the MSI frequency especially since it has been suggested that certain histological types have a higher frequency of MSI. To determine whether there is a relation between histology and MSI within these studies, we looked at the frequency of MSI per histological type for the 628 patients with known histology (Table 2). The summary of these studies suggests that the frequency of MSI is higher in the mucinous and endometrioid adenocarcinoma compared to clear cell and serous adenocarcinoma (the overall frequencies of MSI were 22%, 16%, 9% and 8%, respectively) (Table 2). We hypothesize that mucinous and endometrioid histology might be prone to a higher MSI frequency since sporadic endometrial carcinoma, which is closely related to endometrioid ovarian cancer, has a MSI frequency of 20\u201330% [49-51] and MSI is almost universal present in the colorectal tumors of the hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome which all have a mucinous histological type. Therefore, the different histology's of the ovarian carcinomas included in the several studies seems to be a plausible cause for the wide range in MSI frequency reported in these studies.\n\nNext we addressed the second part of the aim of this study, is MMR inactivation associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. Forty-six of the 75 ovarian carcinomas we analyzed had been treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, eleven did not respond and 34 did. For one patient the response was not known. Methylation of the MLH1 promoter was detected in two of the eleven non-responders (18%) and four of the 34 responders (12%) and this was not significantly different (p = 0.664). Since we did not detect any MSI, the resistance seen in the eleven patients could not be associated with MSI and MMR inactivation.\n\nThe relation between MMR deficiency and platinum-drug resistance has been investigated in only a few in vivo studies. Similarly to our result, no MSI was detected by Mesquita et al. [18] who studied 34 ovarian carcinomas of which seven did not respond to cisplatin/paclitaxel therapy. So the resistance seen in these seven nonresponding patients was also not associated with MMR inactivation. In contrast, Samimi et al. [52] found an inverse relation between MLH1 protein expression and the response to platinum-based chemotherapy in 54 ovarian carcinomas. Again, the number of ovarian carcinomas included in these studies is small and no further conclusion can be drawn from these results.\n\n",

SSCP/HD (single-strand conformational polymorphism/heteroduplex), D-HPLC (denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography) on the Wave instrument (Transgenomic, Omaha, NE), and/or DNA sequencing was applied for screening of exons 1\u201314. DNA sequencing of exon 15 was performed when no mutation had been detected in the initial search. Patients C107, C257 and C505 with no documented inheritance of FAP and where no mutation in the entire APC or MUTYH genes could be detected, were subjected to analyses for mosaic mutations using SSCP/HD. PCR, RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase PCR), SSCP/HD, and PTT were carried out as described previously [33] with the following changes: the Criterion Tris-HCl 8\u201316% gels and Criterion Gel Electrophoresis System (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) were used for the PTT. Primers used for PCR amplification of genomic DNA for subsequent DNA sequencing or PTT are available from the authors upon request. Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences Corp, Piscataway, NJ or Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) was used for PCR amplification prior to DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed on PCR products purified with ExoSAP-IT (USB, Cleveland, OH). Sequence reactions were carried out using ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and analyzed on the ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. MLPA [34] was used to detect deletions/duplications of one or more exons and was carried out as described by Meuller et al [10]. All MLPA analyses were carried out in duplicates and normalized against two different control individuals. All mutations described in this study were verified in a second independent analysis using, as far as possible, an alternative mutation-detection technique.\n\nAnalyses of APC expression\n\nThe level of APC mRNA expression in peripheral blood cells was investigated by TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis in 29 patients from 18 families. RT-PCR was carried out using ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) at the Gothenburg Genomics Core Facility. Primers and probe for the APC gene as well as for GAPD, which was used as internal control, were obtained from [35]. Amplification reactions were performed for the two genes separately in a volume of 10 \u03bcl containing 1 \u03bcl template cDNA diluted 1:10, 1 \u00d7 FAM-labeled Assay-on-Demand Gene Expression Assay Mix, and 1 \u00d7 TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Thermal cycling was performed according to the standard protocol. Triple samples of each patient were analyzed and no-template controls were included in the experiments. As the standard curve method for quantification of RT-PCR products would be used, a series of dilutions of calibrator cDNA were also included. The fluorescence intensities detected during the PCR process were analyzed and converted into threshold cycle values (Ct-values) using the SDS 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems). Using the obtained standard curve for each gene, the concentration of APC and GAPD in each sample was calculated from the mean Ct value of each triplicate. The APC value was then normalized against the housekeeping gene GAPD to obtain a relative measurement of the level of APC expression in the blood of the patient. The Dunnett t-test was used to calculate statistical significance. To verify the expression data, cDNA from the positive individuals was sequenced over an informative heterozygous cSNP position (c.5465A > T). The level of expression of each allele could then be estimated.\n\n",

All patients signed an informed consent before the study. Patients who had histologically proven carcinoma and received operative treatment in our hospital were included in the study. Patients were excluded if they: (1) had evidence of concomitant ulcerative colitis, (2) presented with clinically unresectable diseases, (3) were diagnosed with FAP and other polyposis syndromes, (4) refused operative treatment or refused to participate in the study. This study was approved by the ethical committee of the NUTCM.\n\nExtraction of genomic DNA\n\nFresh tissue samples of tumor and matched normal mucosa were obtained from the surgical specimen once it was removed. DNA was extracted using a tissue DNA extraction kit from the Beijing Bio-lab Materials Institute (Beijing, China) and was stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis.\n\nSynthesis of fluorescent primer\n\nA reference panel of 5 MSI markers recommended by NCI: BAT-26, BAT-25, D2S123, D5S346 and D17S250 were used in this study. The primers of BAT-40 and MYCL were also applied. The fluorescent primers were synthesized at Applied Biosystem Company (Foster City, CA) with a previously published method [6,7].\n\nMicrosatellite instability analysis\n\nMicrosatellite instability was analyzed according to a method previously reported [6,7]. Briefly, the 5 microsatellites were amplified by multiple PCR. The reaction system consisted of 1 \u03bcL of template (extracted genomic DNA, 100 ng), 4 \u03bcL of mixed primers (primer mix) and 15 \u03bcL of ABI Prism True Allele PCR Premix (containing AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase buffer, magnesium chloride and dNTPs) (Applied Biosystems Company). The reaction initially underwent pre-denature at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes, then 30 cycles of: denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 minute, annealing at 56\u00b0C for 1 minute and extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 minute were performed. An additional extension at 72\u00b0C for 25 minutes was performed subsequently.\n\nPCR reaction product (1 \u03bcL) was then mixed with 0.4 \u03bcL LIZ (internal standard) and 9 \u03bcL of formamide. Heat denaturation was performed on the mixture at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, and the sample was kept at 4\u00b0C for 5 minutes. Then the product was put in a 96 well plate, and capillary electrophoresis was performed with an AB13100-Avant sequencer (Applied Biosystem Shanghai Division, Shanghai, China) for 45 minutes. Data was automatically analyzed with Genotyper 2.5 software (Applied Biosystem Shanghai Division) and the original data was generated. The electrophoresis was then repeated on the next day to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.\n\n",

We considered only those chromosomal regions that were reported by different researchers or were found to be aberrant in > 20% of tumor samples. In summary, we found that the majority of deletion regions show a reduction in expression. This suggests that regional transcriptional silencing in CRC is mainly achieved by loss of genomic DNA. In contrast, amplified regions rather show heterogeneous expression changes. We found regions of expression gain in the most frequently reported regions of chromosome gain on 7, 8q, 13, 20q. These regions are in support for a positive correlation of DNA copy number and transcript abundance, although a direct causal relationship is not shown in this study.\n\nExpression in Islands frequently amplified in CRC.\n\nLiterature survey of chromosomal regions with evidence for amplifications in colorectal cancers. We checked all regions of frequent chromosomal amplifications for congruence with expression patterns. Congruence between literature CGH data and our expression data was declared on the presumption that allelic gain causes mRNA up-regulation.\n\nHowever, there are also many regions of frequent deletions that did not show alterations in expression or that were even down-regulated (7q11.2-7q12, 9q34, 12p13.1-13.2, 15q22-15q23, 16p12-16p11, 22q11; compare Tables 3 and 4). One possible explanation is that these down-regulated regions are not amplified in our tumor samples. An alternative explanation is that the influence of chromosomal amplification on transcription levels can be either positive or negative. It is possible that amplification of a particular genomic region disrupts transcription of amplified genes by a yet unknown mechanism, e.g. by induction of chromatin-based silencing, or by separation of essential enhancer regions from transcription starts.\n\nPlatzer et al. found amplifications in 7p, 8q, 13q, 20q in 26%\u201343% of their CRC patients and revealed by microarray-based expression analysis that only 81 of 2146 genes in amplified regions show over-expression (3.8%) whereas 164 of 2146 genes show under-expression (7.7%). Using a different approach (microdissection, oligo arrays, analysis aimed at the identification of single chromosomal expression domains and not at the location of all differentially expressed genes in chromosomes) we found several smaller up-regulated regions and no regions of down-regulation in the same chromosomal regions. Therefore, our data partly contradicts the findings of Platzer et al. which state that in these frequently amplified regions gene expression is rather down-regulated. However, other misregulated expression domains (see above) of our study confirmed the general notion by Platzer et al. that frequently amplified regions in CRC can also exhibit down-regulation of transcript levels.\n\n",

There are only slightly more down-regulated than up-regulated genes. Chromosomal regions that are linked to hereditary colorectal cancer often exhibit deregulated expression, suggesting that they are implicated in spontaneous CRC not only through collection of mutations. Thus, genes in these chromosomal hotspots may be systematically tested in patients with sporadic CRC for molecular lesions and for transcriptional silencing.\n\nChromosomal regions that are frequently deleted in CRC very often comprise islands in which we found reduced expression. Although many regions that are known to be amplified in colorectal tumors show a gain of expression, there are also a considerable number of amplified islands that show no alterations or even down-regulation. Comparison of published CGH studies with our expression data suggests that amplified or deleted chromosomal regions are responsible for many islands with aberrant expression. However, we suggest that it is necessary to invoke other mechanism like epigenetic regulation of chromatin or disruption of enhancer actions to explain the remaining expression imbalances.\n\n",

Here we illustrate that multistage models provide conceptually plausible solutions even when colorectal cancers are divided into biologically relevant and quite different subtypes. Ages at cancer are consistent with five or six somatic oncogenic mutations for hereditary (HNPCC) MSI+ cancers and seven or eight mutations for its sporadic counterpart. The apparent requirement for more than one additional somatic mutation in sporadic MSI+ cancers may reflect that MMR inactivation is commonly epigenetic, which may involve multiple steps. Ages at MSI- cancers were consistent with six or seven oncogenic mutations, with similar estimates for all clinical stages, suggesting that mutations acquired very early in life dictate the cancer phenotype at the time of transformation. Better integration of cancer epidemiology with its biology remains a further challenge.\n\n",

Several software packages for the analysis of array CGH data exist that have been announced to also be suited for the analysis of expression data [42-44]. In the following, we used the ChARM software package [44]. ChARM can be used to infer intervals of variable size with significant positive or negative signal amplitudes in ordered data, such as log(intensity) values in array CGH data and mRNA expression data. We applied the ChARM algorithm on different data sets that harbor information about the numbers of patients with coordinated up- and down-regulation of expression for all genes on human autosomes and the X chromosome. For each chromosome six separate data sets were prepared, according to scanning window sizes of 5, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51. Within each window all possible gene pairs (excluding self comparisons) were considered. For each gene pair, the number of coordinated up-regulated (counted as +1) and down-regulated (counted as -1) was determined. For each window the sum of these gene pair-specific values divided by the total number of pairs gave the cumulative misregulation score (CMS). In a sliding window approach, each gene was associated with a CMS value. CMS values for genes at the edges of chromosomes were calculated with reduced window sizes. The main theoretical advantage of the use of CMS scores compared to raw up-regulation counts or averaged expression ratios is that it captures only information from co-regulated neighboring gene pairs: Noise signals fluctuate across genes and may more often lead to artificial assignment of high expression ratios between two genes. In contrast, real signals of regional up-/down-regulation lead to consistent changes in the same patients for two genes. For each window size, CMS data sets of each chromosome were subject to ChARM analysis. ChARM determines borders of regions with high signal amplitudes in ordered data, here regions of expression imbalances along a chromosome, by an expectation-maximization approach. In addition, ChARM provides different statistical estimates to judge the significance of expression deregulation in a particular chromosomal region [44]. The identified deregulated regions were further evaluated manually using heat maps and the above mentioned gene-versus-gene \"correlation\" plots (see above, Figures 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 and accompanying website).\n\n",

Several resistant sublines of ovarian and melanoma cell lines generated by cisplatin selection, appeared to be MMR deficient [11-15]. In addition, a colon (HCT116) and an endometrioid cell line (HEC59), deficient for MLH1 and MSH2 respectively, were 2.1 and 1.8 fold resistant to cisplatin compared to cell lines complemented with chromosome 3, containing MLH1, or chromosome 2, containing MSH2 [15-17]. These in vitro studies suggest that inactivation of proteins involved in the initiation of MMR might cause cisplatin resistance. It is thought that the DNA damage caused by platin-drugs is recognized by MMR. The cell will then undergo several unsuccessful repair cycles, finally resulting in the induction of apoptosis. When MMR is inactive the DNA damage caused by platin-drugs will not be picked up and will therefore not result in apoptosis rendering the cells resistant to platin-drugs.\n\nSeveral studies have determined the frequency of MMR inactivation in ovarian cancer using MSI as a marker [18-37]. However, there was a wide range observed (0%\u201339%) and so far only a few studies have linked MMR inactivation to platinum-based chemotherapy resistance. Thus, there is still no general agreement about the frequency of MMR inactivation and its possible involvement in the platinum-based chemotherapy resistance seen in ovarian cancer patients.\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine the frequency of mismatch repair (MMR) inactivation in ovarian cancer and whether it is associated with platinum-based chemotherapy resistance. To this purpose we analyzed seventy-five ovarian carcinomas and eight ovarian cancer cell lines. In the discussion, the results were compared to that of twenty similar studies in the literature including in total 1315 ovarian cancer patients.\n\n",

A mutation spectrum displaying the distribution between novel and previously reported mutations is shown in Figure 1. The frequency of APC de novo mutation cases among the families was 16%. In three of the families parents were tested negative for the mutation and in the remaining seven families we where unable to obtain samples to test parents. Thirty-two of the 81 patients with APC mutations were probands. Probands with mutations in the region from codon 1250 to 1464 of the APC gene which predicts a severe phenotype [36] had a median age at diagnosis of 21.8 (range, 11\u201349) years compared with 34.4 (range, 14\u201357) years among those with mutations outside this region (P < 0.017). Available data on colorectal polyp number shows that, in spite of higher age at diagnosis, dense polyposis (> 1000) only occurred in 30% of the probands compared with 75% in those with mutations between codon 1250 and 1464.

The previous study analysed proliferative indices and there was therefore selection of HPs that were large and well-oriented and likely to provide sufficient numbers of longitudinally sectioned crypts. Polyps were eliminated from the present study if there was insufficient residual tissue, blocks contained more than one polyp, polyps contained foci of invasive cancer, or there was failure of DNA amplification for both the BRAF and KRAS mutation assays. Fifteen additional polyps from the parent series generated a total study group of 190 polyps. These were reviewed by the first author and classified as: HPs (n = 49), tubular adenomas (TAs) (n = 62), tubulovillous and villous adenomas (TVAs/VAs) (n = 22), sessile SAs (SSAs) (n = 32), MPs (n = 10) and traditional SAs (n = 15). SSA has also been termed sessile serrated polyp and serrated polyp with atypical proliferation.17,25\u201327 SSA is distinguished from HP on the basis of greater size, aberrant architecture, atypical proliferation, hypermucinous epithelium, predilection for proximal colon25 and molecular features including a higher frequency of BRAF mutation and more extensive DNA methylation.14,16,17 However, the combination of architectural and cytological changes is insufficient for a diagnosis of dysplasia. Serrated polyps with dysplasia include MPs and SAs. MPs may be conceived as a combined lesion that includes: (i) a serrated component that is non-dysplastic and resembles HP or SSA, and (ii) a dysplastic component that may resemble either SA or conventional adenoma.28 For the purposes of this study, lesions were also included as MPs if they comprised separate serrated and non-serrated components that were both dysplastic. SAs are homogeneous lesions in which there is epithelial serration reminiscent of a HP or SSA together with architectural and cytological changes warranting a diagnosis of dysplasia. The cytological atypia of SA may appear similar to that of conventional adenoma in which nuclei are elongated, hyperchromatic and pseudostratified. However, some SAs may be characterized by non-adenomatous forms of dysplasia in which the nuclei are enlarged, ovoid, vesicular and contain a prominent nucleolus, while the cytoplasm is relatively abundant and eosinophilic. The anatomical site of polyps was grouped as proximal colon (up to splenic flexure) versus distal colon and rectum combined. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine, McGill University.\n\n",

HNPCC patients are characterized by earlier symptoms, more mucinous carcinoma, more synchronous and metachronous colorectal tumors and more extra-colonic tumors, but have better survival [1,2]. It is believed that HNPCC is secondary to a germline mutation resulting in a defective MMR gene. A defective MMR gene results in increased DNA replication errors and MSI, which causes the occurrence of tumors in different organs, especially in the colorectum. Identification of HPNCC families is important because the diagnosis, treatment and follow up of these individuals should be different from those with sporadic colorectal cancer [2]. However, the clinical diagnosis of HNPCC patients is very difficult for lack of specific clinical phenotype. Though Amsterdam criteria I and II were established for HNPCC diagnosis[3,4], many HNPCC families still do not meet the criteria.\n\nMSI is an important phenotype of MMR gene mutation. In 1997, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) recommended screening MSI CRCs using the Bethesda guidelines [5]. After compiling evidence from years of global studies and follow up, NCI revised the Bethesda guidelines in 2004, which is called the revised Bethesda standard [6]. NCI recommended screening of HNPCC based on detection of MSI in the tumor and loss of expression of a MMR gene using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining [6]. However, until now, there has been no research about the applicability of the NCI recommendations to the Chinese population with colorectal cancers. The aim of this study is to detect and study MSI carrier and mismatch repair (MMR) gene germline mutation carriers among a Chinese population with colorectal cancer.\n\n",

This does not mean that 25% of the genes are misregulated as many genes that fall into these regions are not expressed at all in tumors and in normal epithelium of the colon. Additionally, we note that these numbers are probably an upper limit because the sliding window approach probably included several genes in close proximity to the boundaries of misexpressed regions. Nevertheless, the number of regions of imbalanced expression is remarkable and suggest that there is extensive regulation in CRC at the genomic level. Recently, Nakao et al. estimated from genome-wide array CGH data that ~17% of the human genome is affected by DNA copy number changes in CRC [23]. Prior to a more detailed analysis of individual regions in this study, this suggested that not all regional expression changes in CRC will be explainable by DNA copy number aberrations.\n\nThere are only slightly more genes with expression loss than regions with expression gain. One can argue that a tumor ought to show a higher frequency of expression loss than expression gain. Reasons are that there should be a tendency to lose tumor suppressor genes selectively and to lose non-essential genes (genomic ballast) as a side effect. If transcription would be a process that is predominantly driven by positive regulation of transcriptional activators, one would assume that any partial genome loss results in a slow down of transcription. In the light of these considerations, an equally high number of regions with expression gain can be interpreted in two ways. Either positive selection drives expression gain of some regions in cancer cells, or a default phenotype of transcription suppression dominates in normal cells which is relaxed during tumor cell development.\n\nGene expression in chromosomal regions with frequent DNA copy number changes in CRC\n\nMost studies reported frequent gains of chromosome 7, 8q, 13q, 20q and losses of 4 and 18q in CRC [18,19,21-25]. These broadly-defined alterations are in perfect agreement with chromosome-specific trends in our expression data, especially the exclusive presence of domains of expression gain on 8, 13 and 20 and the exclusive presence of domains of expression loss on chromosome 4 and 18 (see Table 2 and Figures 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26). There is a single discrepancy for chromosome 7: region 7q11-7q12 has been reported as amplified in CRC, but its expression is significantly down-regulated in our tumor samples.\n\n",

A larger chromosome region comprising this fragment has recently been reported to be frequently deleted in CRC (see Tables 1 and 4). No tumor suppressor gene has been found yet. Our data suggest multiple genes that could act as class II TSGs. Several have been associated with proliferative processes or even cancer before. The PLA2G2A encodes phospholipase A2 group IIA which has been proposed as a TSG and a marker for metastasis and patient survival in gastric cancer [30]. The E2F2 transcription factor is a known regulator of TSGs and interacts specifically with the RB protein. It plays an important role in the cell cycle. The CDC42 protein is a small Rho-like GTPase. It acts in intracellular signaling and is involved in various processes like control of morphology, migration, endocytosis, and the cell cycle. Therefore, PLAG2A, E2F2 and CDC42 are the primary candidate tumor suppressors in this region.\n\nExpression in Islands frequently deleted in CRC.\n\nLiterature survey of chromosomal regions with evidence for deletions in colorectal cancers.

In addition, the 75 ovarian carcinomas were also analysed with the mononucleotide marker BAT40 (n = 42) or with the dinucleotide marker D2S123 (n = 40). So all ovarian carcinomas were analysed with three or four MSI markers. A PCR containing \u03b1-32PdATP, was performed on 100 ng DNA. PCR products were separated on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, gels were dried on blotting paper on a vacuum gel dryer and exposed to x-ray film. The films were evaluated by visual inspection.\n\nThe methylation specific PCR (MSP) was used to determine the promoter methylation of MLH1 after the DNAs were modified with sodium bisulfite using the Ez DNA methylation kit (Zymo research). We designed and optimized primers that are specific for methylated and unmethylated CpG islands within the MLH1 promoter (methylated: Forward 5'-CGAATTAATAGGAAGAGCGGATAGC-3', Reverse 5'-ACCTCAATACCTCGTACTCACG-3'; unmethylated: Forward 5'-TGAATTAATAGGAAGAGTGGATAGT-3', Reverse 5'-CCTCAATACCTCATACTCACA-3'). Both primers are located within a region important for a maximal transcription of MLH1 (including the binding site for the transcription factor CBF) [41,42], since methylation at this region is most likely to inhibit transcription of the gene. The PCR mixture contained 1\u00d7 PCR buffer (as described by Herman et al [43]), dNTPs (each at 5 mM), primers (1 pmol/\u03bcl each per reaction), Taq polymerase (0.05 U/\u03bcl) and 100 ng modified DNA in a volume of 25 \u03bcl. Amplification was carried out for 35 cycles (30 sec 95\u00b0C, 30 sec 58\u00b0C for methylated and 55\u00b0C for unmethylated and 30 sec 72\u00b0C) followed by a final 4 minutes extension at 72\u00b0C.

The overall frequency of BRAF mutation was 8.4% (23/275), comparing favourably with frequencies of 9\u201311% reported for other large studies of this tumor type [6,16,17]. The mean age of patients with and without BRAF mutation was identical (Table 1). Strong associations were observed between BRAF mutation and tumor origin in the proximal side of the large bowel, poor histological grade, mucinous appearance and the presence of infiltrating lymphocytes. Higher frequencies of BRAF mutation were also observed in females and in node negative tumors but these did not reach significance.\n\n(A) Representative F-SSCP gel used to detect BRAF mutationsin colorectal cancer.

(B) DNA sequencing gel resultconfirms the presence of a 1799T to A mutation giving rise to the V600E mutation.\n\nAssociations between BRAF mutation and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer.\n\na Data was unavailable for gender in 43 cases, infiltrating lymphocytes in 55 cases, nodal involvement in 77 cases, tumor site in 56 cases, grade in 106 cases and mucinous appearance in 89 cases.\n\nBRAF mutations showed no association with TP53 mutations and were mutually exclusive with the presence of KRAS mutations (Table 2). In contrast, BRAF mutations were approximately 10-fold more frequent in MSI+ and CIMP+ tumors compared to tumors without these phenotypes. A strong association was also seen with methylation of the MLH1 gene promoter and in particular with methylation of its proximal region. We have previously examined the methylation status of 7 different CpG islands in this CRC series [18]. The mean number of these methylated sites was 3-fold higher in tumors with BRAF mutation compared to those without (2.6 \u00b1 1.7 vs 0.8 \u00b1 1.0; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that MSI+ was the only significant independent predictor of BRAF mutation (RR = 6.3, 95%CI [1.2\u201332.3]; P = 0.028) in a model that included CIMP+, tumor site, histological grade, presence of infiltrating lymphocytes and mucinous appearance.\n\nAssociations between BRAF mutation and molecular features of colorectal cancer.\n\na Data was unavailable for MSI status in 40 cases, methylation status in 83 cases, KRAS mutation in 26 cases and TP53 mutation in 26 cases\n\nWe next examined whether the characteristic features of tumors with BRAF mutation were still apparent following stratification into MSI and CIMP phenotypes. Although the statistical power of this subgroup analysis was limited, the morphological features of infiltrating lymphocytes, poor histological grade and mucinous appearance were clearly associated with BRAF mutation regardless of tumor MSI status (Table 3). Similarly, these features were each more common in tumors with BRAF mutation in both the CIMP- and CIMP+ subgroups (Table 4). Similar to previous observations in a separate CRC cohort [20], the frequency of KRAS mutation was lower in MSI+ compared to MSI- tumors (P = 0.034; Table 3), while the frequency of TP53 mutation was also considerably lower in MSI+ tumors with wildtype BRAF than in MSI- tumors with wildtype BRAF (P = 0.014).\n\n",

Sixty-one of these families are now extinct but 135 families with at least one living disease-affected member remain. Presently, 315 disease-affected living patients are included in the registry. The geographical catchment area comprises the whole of Sweden. Details of how patients have been eligible for accession into the registry are given in [30]. In this study we have analyzed 96 families included in the registry for mutations in the APC gene. Twenty-four of the remaining 39 families have been analyzed for APC gene mutations at other genetic laboratories and 15 families remain to be tested. We have previously reported six of these patients who carried bi-allelic MUTYH mutations [31]. Probands were defined as those diagnosed on the basis of the occurrence of symptoms and irrespective of other cases in the family and call-up patients, as those identified as subjects at risk on the basis of studies of pedigrees and found to have FAP. De novo mutations were defined in those individuals where none of the parents carried the mutation or where the parents had a negative colonoscopy after the age of 50 or died of a non-FAP related cause after the age of 75.

It is expected that these mechanisms have a strong effect on regional gene expression.\n\nResults\n\nWe investigated genome-wide gene expression in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and normal epithelial tissues from 25 patients using oligonucleotide arrays. This allowed us to identify 81 distinct chromosomal islands with aberrant gene expression. Of these, 38 islands show a gain in expression and 43 a loss of expression. In total, 7.892 genes (25.3% of all human genes) are located in aberrantly expressed islands. Many chromosomal regions that are linked to hereditary colorectal cancer show deregulated expression. Also, many known tumor genes localize to chromosomal islands of misregulated expression in CRC.\n\nConclusion\n\nAn extensive comparison with published CGH data suggests that chromosomal regions known for frequent deletions in colon cancer tend to show reduced expression. In contrast, regions that are often amplified in colorectal tumors exhibit heterogeneous expression patterns: even show a decrease of mRNA expression. Because for several islands of deregulated expression chromosomal aberrations have never been observed, we speculate that additional mechanisms (like abnormal states of regional chromatin) also have a substantial impact on the formation of co-expression islands in colorectal carcinoma.\n\n",

                "text": "Background\n\nCarcinogenesis is a multi-step process that involves the accumulation of numerous genetic and epigenetic changes in cells [1]. These genetic aberrations affect a limited number of identified pathways that are involved in (colorectal) carcinogenesis [2]. A genetic model for sporadic colorectal cancer has been proposed, which describes the sequential accumulation of specific genetic alterations in various pathways, involving tumour suppressor genes (e.g. APC, SMAD4, TP53) and oncogenes (e.g. CTNNB1, K-ras) [3,4]. Important molecular pathways that upon activation affect the early and intermediate stages of colorectal carcinogenesis are the Wnt and Ras signalling pathways, whereas TP53 inactivation is considered a late event.\n\nActivation of the Wnt pathway plays a central role in the aetiology of most colorectal cancers and is often the result of mutations in the N-terminal domain of the APC gene, that lead to partial or complete loss of this region and thereby to loss of the \u03b2-catenin regulating function [5,6]. Conversely, in tumours lacking these APC mutations [7], activating missense mutations at one of the phosphorylation sites at codons 31, 33, 37 and 45 of exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene (encoding the \u03b2-catenin protein) can render it stable as it can no longer be tagged for cellular degradation. Activation of the Ras pathway in cancer is marked by the loss of the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Ras protein, which can be ascribed to missense mutations in codons 12 and 13 of exon 1, which are responsible for 90% activating mutations in the of the K-ras gene [8].\n\nAccording to the paradigm for colorectal cancer development, mutations in the APC and K-ras are thought to contribute to the early developmental stages of colorectal cancer [3]. However, a recent study based on the analysis of APC, K-ras and TP53 genes concluded that simultaneous occurrence of all three genetic alterations is rare and that multiple genetic pathways may be relevant to colorectal cancer [9].\n\nGenetic instability is seen in most types of cancer [10]. Two distinct types of genetic instability appear to occur in colorectal cancer [11]: chromosomal and microsatellite instability. Chromosomal instability results in gains or losses of entire chromosomes or parts of them, and gives rise to aneuploid tumours and occurs in the majority of cancers. A smaller proportion of colorectal cancers displays microsatellite instability, represented by diploid cells acquiring high mutation rates, and was found to be associated with defective mismatch repair [12]. These tumours are less likely to harbour mutations in genes associated with chromosomally instable and generally aneuploid tumours, such as APC, K-ras and TP53 [13-21], suggesting that these tumours form a distinct group. Moreover, microsatellite instable tumours are found predominantly in the proximal colon [22,23], are more likely to occur in patients with a positive family history of colorectal cancer [22,23], are often less differentiated than microsatellite stable tumours [22], and occur more frequently in women [24] and at older age [25]. Moreover, in tumours displaying microsatellite instability, mutations the CTNNB1 gene were more frequent [26].\n\n",

The classical FAP phenotype is defined by hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps that develop in the large intestine, conferring a high risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). A variety of extra-colonic manifestations exist in FAP. Duodenal adenomas are common and carcinomas of the duodenum are a main cause of death in FAP patients. Patients also have an increased risk of developing extra-intestinal tumors, for example, desmoids. Recently, a new type of colorectal adenomatous polyposis has been described, MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) [3] or MUTYH-associated CRC (MIM#608456). MAP is caused by biallelic mutations in the MUTYH (mutY homologue; MIM*604933) gene (1p32.1-p34.3) and is inherited in a recessive manner [4,5].\n\nThe majority of germline APC mutations identified in FAP families cause truncations in this multifunctional protein [6,7]. The APC truncations most often occur as the result of nonsense APC mutations or frameshifts caused by small deletions/insertions. Large APC deletions are found in a limited number of FAP cases. By using methods such as quantitative real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) rather than conventional mutation-detection techniques, we can achieve higher detection rates of large deletions [8-12]. The number of reported characterized APC splice-site mutations is comparatively low [13-17]. Approximately 10\u201315% of the FAP patients could have a reduced or absent APC expression [18]. The cause of the reduced expression is not known but the patients show a similar phenotype to those with an identified truncating APC mutation [19-21]. It has been shown that a decrease of approximately 50% of the expression of an allele can result in a predisposition to FAP [20]. Germline APC-mutation mosaicism in FAP patients has been reported [22-25] but is not generally included in the mutation screening procedure provided by most labs owing to the technical difficulties encountered with these analyses.\n\nDifferent genotype-phenotype correlations in FAP have been suggested [26-28]. The classic phenotype is primarily caused by mutations in the central part of the APC gene. Mutations around codon 1309 cause a severe course of disease with early onset and profuse polyposis. The milder, attenuated form of disease (AFAP), characterized by less than 100 adenomas and later onset of adenomatosis and CRC, is often caused by mutations in the far 5' and 3' regions of the APC gene, as well as in the part excluded by alternative splicing of exon 9 [29].\n\n",

Microsatellite instability (MSI), which is a marker for MMR inactivation, was detected in three out of eight cell lines i.e. SKOV3, 2774 and A2780. This results in a frequency of MMR inactivation in ovarian cancer cell lines of 38%. The MSI in SKOV3 can be explained by the loss of MLH1 mRNA expression which, however, was not caused by promoter methylation. This is in agreement with the loss of MLH1 protein expression seen in SKOV3 described in a study of the 60 NCI cancer cell lines [44]. In concordance with our findings, 2774 was also described to be MSI [45]. One of the MSI positive A2780 sublines showed a strong methylation of the MLH1 promoter without MLH1 mRNA expression, while the other subline showed a low level of methylation and relative high mRNA expression. Strathdee et al. described that one MLH1 allele was methylated in A2780 [12] which is comparable with the methylation status we saw in A2780, moreover one of our A2780 sublines showed complete methylation. On the other hand, another study did not detect MSI in A2780 [11]. Interestingly, Aquilina and colleagues suggested there is a subpopulation of A2780 cells, estimated to be around one per 106 cells [46], which are MLH1 deficient and heterozygous for the p53phe172 mutation [46,47]. Since these cells have a growth advantage, prolonged culturing of the A2780 cell line can result in selection of this subpopulation. Thus over time, separately cultured A2780 can have varying percentages of cells belonging to this subpopulation which may explain the discrepancies in MMR status seen in the A2780 cell lines analyzed by us.\n\nNext we studied the association between MMR inactivation and cisplatin resistance in these cell lines. MMR inactivation seen in SKOV3 and 2774 might result in the relative resistance to cisplatin compared to the other cell lines. On the other hand, A2780 which has clearly an inactive MMR, was most sensitive to cisplatin. Overall, there seems to be no association between the response to cisplatin and MMR status in these eight cell lines. This is similar to a study in the 60 NCI cell lines which also showed no association between response to cisplatin and MMR status based on the MLH1 and/or MSH2 protein expression [44].\n\n",

In these plots, the smoothing of the curve is achieved by averaging over 50 consecutive genes.\n\nSignificant deviations from average expression in a particular chromosomal region is not sufficient to infer coordinated deregulation. This is because it does not allow to infer whether all genes of a region are actually de-regulated in the same subset of patients. They could also be de-regulated in different patients. Consider three genes G1, G2, G3 and their expression in patients A,B,C,D. Each gene is up-regulated in 50% of patients. If the genes are up-regulated in different patients (G1 is up-regulated in A/B, G2 is up-regulated in B/C, G3 is up-regulated in C/D), then one can not assume that there is a regional up-regulation in all patients. However, if the genes are up-regulated in the same patients (G1, G2 and G3 are all up-regulated in A and B), then it is fair to assume that they have undergone coordinated regional up-regulation. Chance effects more likely create non-coordinated up-regulation. To capture such a gene-versus-gene correlation structure, we performed the following for a given chromosome region:\n\nFor each pair of genes of a given chromosome region we count the number of their coordinated (simultaneous) up-regulations (based on the above computed fold changes) over the set of patients and the number of coordinated down-regulations, separately. These values can be represented in gray-scale plots: one gray scale plot for the coordinated up-regulation and a similar one for coordinated down-regulation. Both, horizontal and vertical axis comprise genes of the chromosome region in the right chromosomal order (see Figures 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32). The darkness of squares represents the number of coordinated up- or down-regulations, respectively. Coordinately up-regulated regions show up as squares with high \"correlation\" measures along the diagonal. Such resulting cross-comparison matrices can be visualized interactively for any chromosomal region on our supplementary website[41] along with heat maps of expression intensities and are used in Figures 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. Alternatively, we applied \"correlation\" measures like Pearson correlation coefficients on fold changes, mutual information, and set-theoretic coefficients like the Dice and Jaccard coefficients on binary patterns of up-regulation and down-regulation (only available on our website [41]).\n\n",

Amplifications of regions on chromosome 20q have been identified independently by several groups in CRCs [19,21,23,24]. The interval comprises the known tumor gene SRC (located between MANBAL and BLCAP in Figures 12, 13, 14) for which no informative expression measures were obtained. We note that it is possible that the SRC gene is the primary target of up-regulation in our CRC patients, the up-regulation of other genes being just piggy-back effects. However, also the up-regulation of the CTNN1L1 transcript could be of potential functional significance for CRC development. CTNN1L1 shows partial homology to the known colorectal cancer gene beta-catenin in the armadillo repeat region and has a nuclear localization signal, suggesting that it could play an important role in signal transduction to the nucleus in CRC. Also up-regulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itchy (ITCH) could be of potential importance as selective ubiquitin-tagging of signaling proteins for destruction is an emerging mechanism in cancer biology. The need for accelerated protein synthesis in cancer cells is reflected by the up-regulation of the translation initiation factor EIF2S2. Remarkably, we found dramatic down-regulation against the regional trend of C20orf110 alias p53-inducible protein 2 (TP53INP2) whose expression is usually positively controlled by the p53 protein. For unknown reasons p53 seems to be unable to induce TP53INP2 expression in the majority of CRCs studied here.\n\n",

In 2004, the NCI recommended the revised Bethesda criteria as a HNPCC screening guideline and established the HNPCC diagnostic procedures. These guidelines stated that MSI should firstly be identified in colorectal tumor tissue, and then genetic tests would be performed to confirm MMR gene germline mutations in a blood sample [6].\n\nAt present, a number of publications have studied the value of the revised Bethesda criteria and the relevant diagnostic procedures [13,14]. However, there has not been any systematic report on germline mutations of MMR genes in the Chinese population. Moreover, we found that research from some countries have results that, if applied to the NCI recommendations, may have resulted in a missed HNPCC family or low pick-up rate of HNPCC. In a study by Pinol et al. from Spain [13], 287 out of 1222 patients (23.5%) complied with the revised Bethesda standard. Ninety-one patients (7.4%) were MSI carriers, but only 11 patients (0.9%) had germline mutations of MSH2 or MLH1. This means that among this group, only 0.9% of patients could be diagnosed as HNPCC. In a study by Yearsley et al. [14], out of 482 US patients with colorectal cancers, 87 patients (18%) were MSI carriers and only 12 cases (2.5%) had MMR gene germline mutations. These results may be explained by different case selections and sensitivity of the tests used. On the other hand, in their study of HNPCC related tumors in young patients (<50 years old), Niessen et al. [15] found that the rate of MSH2, MSH6 and MLH1 germline mutations in MSI carriers was 82%. In our 146 patients with colorectal cancers, 34 patients (23.3%) had MSI colorectal cancer. This is comparable to the studies by Pinol et al. [13] and Yearsley et al. [16]. Wong et al. [17] showed that in the case of sporadic endometrial carcinoma, MSI endometrial carcinoma accounted for 26% of patients. Our results showed that there were 15 (10.3%) CRCs with MSI-L and 19 (13.0%) CRCs with MSL-H, respectively. Lamberti et al. [18] reported that MSI-L and MSI-H accounted for 6% and 17%, respectively, of German patients. These results are similar to ours. Unexpectedly, in the present study, the age of patients with MSS colorectal cancers (60 yrs) was similar to the age of patients with MSI-H (61 yrs). In contrast, the average age of patients with MSI-L colorectal cancer was 71, which was quite different from the reports of other research groups [13,15,18]. In a study of 1263 patients with colorectal cancers, Benatti et al. [19] found that those who were MSI carriers tended to have mucinous and right colonic tumours. Noda et al. [20] also found that MSI carriers have more right colonic tumors. However, in our study, tumors in the MSI group were most commonly located at the rectum, and mucinous carcinoma was not the most common pathological type, as it only accounted for 29%. Interestingly, patients in our MSI-L group were older than the MSS group. The reason for these findings is uncertain. Bettstetter et al. [20] reported that the average age of MSI CRCs with MLH1 negative staining was 80 yrs, which was similar to our results. Most of these MSI CRCs were caused by MLH1 promoter hypermethylation. In our group, out of 34 MSI CRCs, 19 CRCs (55.9%) were hypermethylated at the MLH1 promoter, which accounted for 73.7% of MSI-H CRCs and 33.3% of MSI CRCs. Anacleto et al. [21] reported that 8 out of 15 MSI CRCs had MLH1 promoter hypermethylation, which was similar to our results. Kim et al. [10] found that in MSI-H gastric cancers, the MLH1 hypermethylation occurred in 89% of patients. Bettstetter et al. [20] showed that all sporadic MSI-H CRCs were hypermethylated at the MLH1 promoter. These results were similar to ours. Fourteen out of 16 MLH1 negatively staining CRCs were hypermethylated at the MLH1promoter. Mutation analysis revealed that 8 patients (23.5%) had MMR gene germline mutations out of 34 MSI patients. Five patients had MSH2 mutations and 3 had MSH6 mutations, while no MLH1 mutation was found. There were 2 and 6 patients who had mutations in MSH2 and MSH6 in the MSI-L and MSI-H groups, respectively. Yearsley et al. [15], in their study of 87 patients with MSI colorectal cancers, found 12 patients (13.8%) with MLH1 and MSH2 germline mutations. Niessen et al. [16], however, found that the rate of MSH2, MSH6 and MLH1 germline mutations was 82% in the young age group (<50 years old). This was quite different from our group. This difference might be due to different case selections of the two groups. Our study was more representative of the patient population because it was a successive cohort study. Most importantly, the above differences may also be explained by underlying differences in genetic background between Chinese and Western populations.\n\n",

The frequent finding of either BRAF or KRAS mutations in both types of serrated polyp indicated that MPs and SAs might be heterogeneous lesions. These 25 serrated polyps with dysplasia were therefore grouped differently. Group A polyps (n = 16) included a non-dysplastic serrated component and/or dysplastic epithelium in which the architectural and cytological changes were more reminiscent of HP than adenoma (Figure 1A,B). Group B polyps (n = 9) comprised serrated polyps in which the epithelial dysplasia appeared adenomatous (Figure 1C,D). BRAF mutation occurred in 10/16 Group A polyps but only 1/9 Group B polyps (P < 0.03). KRAS mutation occurred in only 3/16 Group A polyps but in 5/9 Group B polyps (P = 0.06). In each of the five Group B polyps with KRAS mutation, the adenomatous component showed both villous change and serration.\n\nA, Serrated adenoma (SA) (BRAF mutation) with a \u2018hyperplastic\u2019 appearance but with architectural and cytological features of a non-adenomatous form of dysplasia. The latter include marked epithelial serration and surface papillarity and nuclei that are ovoid, vesicular and contain a prominent nucleolus (inset). The columnar cells (inset) contain apical mucin droplets, similar to sessile SA (SSA). B, Mixed polyp (BRAF mutation) comprising SSA (left) and SA with high-grade dyplasia showing back-to-back glands (right) and aberrant expression of p53 (inset). C,D, Two mixed polyps (MPs) (both SA/tubulo-villous adenoma and with KRAS mutation) in which the serrated epithelium has an adenomatous appearance as evidenced by elongated hyperchomatic nuclei with marked stratification and a dark amphophilic cytoplasm. The pure adenomatous component is not shown. E,F, Low- and medium-power images of a SA (KRAS mutation) in which complex microacini have resulted in markedly serrated epithelial contours. The epithelium comprises numerous goblet cells and absorptive-type columnar cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and is reminiscent of the goblet cell variant of hyperplastic polyp. These examples illustrate the range of appearances and genetic changes that are encompassed by \u2018traditional\u2019 SA.\n\nWith respect to the 25 serrated polyps with dysplasia, only five occurred in the proximal colon (up to the splenic flexure). Two of these had BRAF mutation (both Group A) and two had KRAS mutation (both Group B). Seven of the 11 BRAF mutations occurred in polyps derived from the left colon or rectum (remaining two polyps with BRAF mutation from site unknown). The three Group A SAs with KRAS mutation (all from the left colon or rectum) comprised numerous goblet cells and adjacent cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and no mucin production or microvesicular appearance (Figure 1E,F). These SAs therefore resembled the goblet cell variant of HP.\n\n",

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has recommended the Revised Bethesda guidelines for screening HNPCC. There has been a great deal of research on the value of these tests in other countries. However, literature about the Chinese population is scarce. Our objective is to detect and study microsatellite instability (MSI) and mismatch repair (MMR) gene germline mutation carriers among a Chinese population with colorectal cancer.\n\nMethods\n\nIn 146 prospectively recruited consecutive patients with clinically proven colorectal cancer, MSI carriers were identified by analysis of tumor tissue using multiplex fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the NCI recommended panel and classified into microsatellite instability-low (MSI-L), microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and microsatellite stable (MSS) groups. Immunohistochemical staining for MSH2, MSH6 and MLH1 on tissue microarrays (TMAs) was performed, and methylation of the MLH1 promoter was analyzed by quantitative methylation specific PCR (MSP). Germline mutation analysis of blood samples was performed for MSH2, MSH6 and MLH1 genes.\n\nResults\n\nThirty-four out of the 146 colorectal cancers (CRCs, 23.2%) were MSI, including 19 MSI-H CRCs and 15 MSI-L CRCS. Negative staining for MSH2 was found in 8 CRCs, negative staining for MSH6 was found in 6 CRCs. One MSI-H CRC was negative for both MSH6 and MSH2. Seventeen CRCs stained negatively for MLH1. MLH1 promoter methylation was determined in 34 MSI CRCs. Hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter occurred in 14 (73.7%) out of 19 MSI-H CRCs and 5 (33.3%) out of 15 MSI-L CRCs. Among the 34 MSI carriers and one MSS CRC with MLH1 negative staining, 8 had a MMR gene germline mutation, which accounted for 23.5% of all MSI colorectal cancers and 5.5% of all the colorectal cancers. Five patients harbored MSH2 germline mutations, and three patients harbored MSH6 germline mutations. None of the patients had an MLH1 mutation. Mutations were commonly located in exon 7 and 12 of MSH2 and exon 5 of MSH6. Right colonic lesions and mucinous carcinoma were not common in MSI carriers.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur data may imply that the characteristics of HNPCC in the Chinese population are probably different from those of Western countries. Application of NCI recommended criteria may not be effective enough to identify Chinese HNPCC families. Further studies are necessary to echo or refute our results so as to make the NCI recommendation more universally applicable.\n\n",

Cancers requiring more mutations will tend to appear later in life. This type of approach may be confounded by biologic heterogeneity because different cancer subtypes may require different numbers of mutations. For example, a sporadic cancer should require at least one more somatic mutation relative to its hereditary counterpart.\n\nMethods\n\nTo better estimate numbers of mutations before transformation, 1,022 colorectal cancers were classified with respect to microsatellite instability (MSI) and germline DNA mismatch repair mutations characteristic of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). MSI- cancers were also classified with respect to clinical stage. Ages at cancer and a Bayesian algorithm were used to estimate the numbers of oncogenic mutations required for transformation for each cancer subtype.\n\nResults\n\nAges at MSI+ cancers were consistent with five or six oncogenic mutations for hereditary (HNPCC) cancers, and seven or eight mutations for its sporadic counterpart. Ages at cancer were consistent with seven mutations for sporadic MSI- cancers, and were similar (six to eight mutations) regardless of clinical cancer stage.\n\nConclusion\n\nDifferent biologic subtypes of colorectal cancer appear to require different numbers of oncogenic mutations before transformation. Sporadic MSI+ cancers may require more than a single additional somatic alteration compared to hereditary MSI+ cancers because the epigenetic inactivation of MLH1 commonly observed in sporadic MSI+ cancers may be a multistep process. Interestingly, estimated numbers of MSI- cancer mutations were similar (six to eight mutations) regardless of clinical cancer stage, suggesting a propensity to spread or metastasize does not require additional mutations after transformation. Estimates of oncogenic mutation numbers may help explain some of the biology underlying different cancer subtypes.\n\n",

Seven of the 75 ovarian carcinomas showed MLH1 promoter methylation. We confirmed whether the observed MLH1 promoter methylation results in the inactivation of the gene by determining the MLH1 mRNA expression with quantitative RT-PCR. The six tumors with low level MLH1 promoter methylation appeared to express MLH1 at mRNA levels similar to that of the unmethylated tumors. Thus a low level of methylation does not result in an altered expression of the MLH1 gene. In contrast, the abundant methylation seen in the remaining carcinoma was associated with the lowest MLH1 mRNA expression level of all 50 ovarian carcinomas tested. However, none of the ovarian carcinomas showed MSI for BAT25, BAT26 and for BAT40 or D2S123 which suggests a frequency of MMR inactivation of 0%. The low MLH1 mRNA expression seen in the abundant methylated carcinoma might be sufficient enough for a functional MMR which results in the observed absence of MSI.\n\nSince ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterized by various histological types which may have different MSI frequencies, the number of specimens analyzed is very important in characterizing a feature that may be uncommon such as MSI. We therefore, made a summary of 20 studies totaling 1315 ovarian carcinomas, to compare the findings of these studies with our results (Table 2). The MSI frequencies determined in these studies ranged from 0% to 39%. Overall, MSI was detected in 165 of the 1315 ovarian carcinomas tested, suggesting an overall incidence of 13% [18-37].\n\nMultiple differences between these studies could have caused the wide range in the MSI frequency (0\u201339%). One of these is the number and variety of microsatellite markers analyzed to determine the MSI. The NCI recommended five markers comprising the National Cancer Institute Consensus Panel (NCI-CP) for the detection of MSI, i.e. markers for the mononucleotide repeats BAT25 and BAT26 and the dinucleotide repeats D2S123, D5S346 and D17S250 [48]. Table 2 shows per study the number of MS markers used and specifies how many of these are part of the NCI-CP. Interestingly, the studies that used all NCI-CP markers to determine the MS status also showed a wide range in MSI frequency (8\u201339%) which is similar to the overall range (0\u201339%). Therefore, the various MS markers used cannot be the sole cause for the wide range. Moreover, Gras et al. suggest that the reliability of the mononucleotide markers BAT25 and BAT26 is so high that most MSI can be predicted by evaluating these two markers exclusively [27], confirming the less stringent role for the various markers used for the analysis.\n\n",

Sequencing of genomic DNA was then used to pinpoint the genetic alteration causing the aberrant mRNA sequence that was visualized in the PTT experiments. The use of both DNA- and mRNA-based methods is a prerequisite for high-quality investigation of splice-site mutations.\n\nA case of reduced APC expression\n\nThe study of mRNA levels was the next step in the line of investigation of the cause of disease in patients with no detected APC mutation. Family 1 is the largest kindred in the Swedish Polyposis Registry; this family includes 150 individuals of whom 57 are affected by the disease (Figure 6 shows part of the pedigree). However, no pathogenic mutation had been detected after screening the whole coding region of the APC gene but as the family did show positive linkage to the APC locus we decided to perform expression analyses and evidence of lowered APC expression was obtained by quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 5A). The result was supported by the indication of a lower expression from the T-allele from analysis of the APC c.5465A > T polymorphism in the cDNA sequencing diagram of two affected family members (Figure 5B). The search for mutations in the DNA sequence of the APC promoters has been initiated, but no pathogenic change has been detected to this date. The possibility of the pathogenic change being epigenetic will have to be investigated further. Hypermethylation of CpG sites in the promoter of APC has been reported as a means of gene silencing in colorectal tumors [46-49]. To the best of the authors' knowledge no germ-line inactivation of APC caused by promoter hypermethylation has been reported. However, cases of pathogenic germline epimutations have been identified in the MLH1 gene, which causes hereditary non-polyposis CRC [50,51].\n\nMutation-detection frequency\n\nThe 61 different APC mutations listed in Additional file 2 were identified among 81 of the 96 families of the Swedish Polyposis Registry that were screened for APC mutations. Fifteen of the cases shown to be APC-mutation negative where all subjected to mutational screening of the MUTYH gene and six of them were shown to carry biallelic MUTYH mutations (reported in Kanter Smoler et al[31]). The overall mutation-detection rate in APC and MUTYH among the families in our study was thus 90%. In total, 84% of the families carried APC mutations while 6% where positive for biallelic MUTYH mutations. The mutation-detection rate we have reached in this study is notably high. In fact, a disease-causing mutation was detected in all cases who presented with a classical FAP phenotype (except for family 1 (C152), where we have clear indications for inactivation of the APC transcription). The mutation-negative patients all display an attenuated form of disease. However, as we have also found subtle mutations in the APC gene in patients with attenuated FAP, we have to consider inactivation of APC to be responsible for some of these FAP cases.\n\n",

The treatment of ovarian adenocarcinoma has improved over the last 20 years owing to the combined treatment of cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy [2]. Although the response of the primary tumor to taxane and platinum-based chemotherapy is high, about 20% of patients never achieve a clinical response and the majority of the patients will relapse and eventually die of drug-resistant disease [3].\n\nIf it would be possible to predict primary platinum resistance, patients might be spared an ineffective but toxic platinum-containing therapy and might benefit from an early therapy with different drugs. Recently, several molecular profiling studies, including our study, have revealed gene sets that can predict response to platinum-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer [4-6]. We discovered a nine-gene set which predicts response with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 59% [5]. One of these nine genes was proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA is a DNA sliding clamp that interacts with several proteins involved in cell cycle control, DNA methylation, DNA replication and DNA repair including mismatch repair [7]. In this study, we have focused on DNA mismatch repair and its role in platinum-based chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer.\n\nDNA mismatch repair (MMR) is divided into three steps: initiation, excision and resynthesis (Figure 1). Several proteins are involved in the initiation of MMR including the three MutS-homologs, MSH2, MSH3 and MSH6. The MutS homologs form a heterodimer that recognizes DNA damage; the MSH2 and MSH6 dimer (the hMutS\u03b1 complex) recognizes base-base mismatches and single base loops whereas the MSH2 and MSH3 dimer (hMutS\u03b2 complex) recognizes insertion/deletion loops of more then one base. After the recognition of the DNA damage the binding of a heterodimer of the MutS-homologs MLH1 and PMS2 (the hMutL\u03b1 complex) leads to the further initiation of MMR. Other known and still unknown proteins involved in the last two steps of MMR, the excision of the damaged strand and the resynthesis, are recruited subsequently. Proteins known to be involved are exonuclease ExoI, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), DNA polymerase \u03b4 and perhaps \u03b5 and in addition based on its association with DNA polymerase \u03b4 and PCNA, DNA ligase I [8,9].\n\nInactivation of MMR leads to the occurrence of unrepaired deletions in mono- and dinucleotide repeats resulting in variable lengths of these repeats. This is called microsatellite instability (MSI) and MSI is therefore used as a marker for MMR deficiency. MSI can be caused by genetic or epigenetic inactivation of several genes involved in MMR. Mouse knockout models have demonstrated that MSH2-/-, MSH3-/-, MLH1-/- and PMS2-/- leads to a high frequency of MSI while MSH6-/- and PMS1-/- cause a low frequency (reviewed by Wei et al. [10]). However, in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) families (which are known to have a high frequency of MSI) germline mutations in MSH2 and MLH1 are responsible for the MSI, while MSH6 and PMS2 are less frequently involved [9]. The lesser role for MSH6, PMS2, PMS1 and especially MSH3 inactivation in MSI seen in HNPCC patients could be due to functional redundancy of these genes.\n\n",

                "text": "Of the microsatellite instable tumours, approximately 90% show absence of hMLH1 expression [24]. In most sporadic colorectal cancers, the promoter region of hMLH1 is hypermethylated, resulting in absence of the protein [53-55]. BAT-26 was previously shown to identify microsatellite instability in sporadic colorectal cancer [56] and results from our study showed a good agreement between unstable BAT-26 and absent hMLH1 expression.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that microsatellite instability and mutations in APC and K-ras occur almost mutually exclusively [18,19,21,57], suggesting that these characteristics represent separate pathways. However, others have observed aberrations in both pathways, but these studies have been performed in relatively small groups of HNPCC and sporadic colorectal cancer patients [14,20,58] and this may have given rise to a relative overrepresentation of mutation detection in both pathways. Although in our study the simultaneous occurrence of hMLH1 deficiency as well as an APC or K-ras mutation was observed in a small number of tumours, the mutually exclusive occurrence of hMLH1 deficiency and mutations in APC and/or K-ras seemed to predominate.\n\nMoreover, after exclusion of tumours displaying this overlap, a striking difference between occurrences of APC and/or K-ras mutations versus absence of hMLH1 expression was observed. The differences were most pronounced with regard to tumour sub-localisation and differentiation. hMLH1 deficient tumours occur almost exclusively in the proximal colon and are relatively more frequently poorly differentiated, which is in accordance with reports from other studies [22-25].\n\n",

The findings were correlated with loss of expression of O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). KRAS mutation occurred more frequently (26.5%) than BRAF mutation (4.8%) in adenomas (P < 0.001) and particularly in adenomas with villous architecture (50%). Loss of expression of MGMT correlated with KRAS mutation in small tubular adenomas (P < 0.04). BRAF mutation was frequent in HPs (67%) and SSAs (81%), while KRAS mutation was infrequent (4% and 3%, respectively). Of MPs and SAs, 72% had either BRAF or KRAS mutation. Aberrant expression of p53 was uncommon overall, but occurred more frequently in MPs and SAs (12%) than adenomas (1%) (P < 0.04) and there was concordant loss of expression of MGMT.\n\nConclusions\n\nMolecular alterations that are characteristic of the serrated pathway and adenoma\u2013carcinoma sequence can co-occur in a minority of advanced colorectal polyps that then show morphological features of both pathways. These lesions account for only 2% of colorectal polyps, but may be relatively aggressive.\n\n",

We assume that deletion or epigenetic silencing of this region is a frequent mechanism contributing to colorectal tumorigenesis.

Full or partial losses of chromosome 4 are well known phenomena in the development of CRC [18,19,23,24]. One of the strongly down-regulated genes in this region is the SLIT2 gene at 4p15.31 that encodes a membrane protein regulating cellular migration. It has recently been described as a new tumor suppressor gene in CRC, gliomas, lung and breast tumors and seems to be transcriptionally inactivated by epigenetic silencing [31-33]. In addition, several other genes of this region could serve as candidate class II tumor suppressor genes. The GPR125 gene encodes an orphan G-protein coupled receptor that has a large extracellular N-terminus with an immunoglobulin domain and leucine-rich repeats, similar to GPR49 described above. The PCDH7 gene belongs to the protocadherin gene family. It encodes a transmembrane protein that has seven extracellular cadherin repeats, suggesting that it is involved in cellular adhesion and adhesion-dependent intracellular signaling. The functions of genes in this region suggest that this regional expression loss influences adhesion and migration properties of cancer cells. Both, epigenetic silencing and chromosomal aberrations are potential mechanisms leading to expression loss in this region.\n\n",

A model for the attenuated phenotype in patients carrying mutations in the first four exons of APC have been suggested by Heppner Goss et al [42], in which the internal ATG at codon 184 could be used as an alternative translation initiation codon in the allele carrying a truncating mutation upstream of this site (Figure 1). Such an alternative start of translation would supply the cell with an APC protein of almost full length, thus explaining the attenuated phenotype. Patient C159, with the most 3' localized mutation was a case of attenuated FAP (100\u20131000 polyps, 46 years of age at diagnosis). In family 1 (reduced expression of APC), patient C152 displayed a classical FAP phenotype including a large number of polyps, duodenal adenomas, and fundic gland polyps (Additional file 1).\n\nThe APC- and MUTYH-mutation negative patients all display an attenuated form of disease with a low number of polyps, comparably high age at diagnosis, and a low frequency of extracolonic manifestations. Whether these patients really are affected by APC-associated FAP can (of course) be called into question. However, among attenuated cases of FAP in these study we have found very subtle mutations such as the mosaic case as well as the c.70C > T mutation and splice-site mutations. Considering these facts, at least some of the cases could be caused by mutations in APC resulting in only partially inactivation of the gene function. Since the main purpose of this study was to achieve as high mutation-detection rate as possible in families with colorectal polyposis syndromes, using a range of different molecular genetic techniques, we have not yet performed any further analyses of the relatively few mutation negative cases to determine if they belong to non-polyposis CRC syndromes.\n\nLarge deletions of the APC gene\n\nThe fraction of large deletions of all APC mutations identified in the Swedish patients was 9%, which is higher than the 5% of large deletions reported in [38]. The relatively large number of gross deletions identified could be a result of the thorough analysis applied for every patient, including the use of the MLPA technique. It is noteworthy that no deletion of APC exon 4 in patient 3765 was detected using MLPA although it had been identified and confirmed by other methods. A still untested possibility is that exon 4 has been translocated to another chromosomal locus and thus generates the positive MLPA result.\n\n",

                "text": "Background\n\nGenetic testing is conducted for diverse purposes, including confirmation of diagnosis, risk prediction, carrier testing and reproductive decision-making. The identification of germ-line mutations in patients with inherited cancer syndromes enables them to be included in cancer surveillance programmes. Such programmes are effective in reducing cancer mortality in the families concerned. Moreover, family members who do not carry the mutation can be treated safely as low-risk individuals, avoiding unnecessary screening and preventing anxiety in the individuals concerned. Unfortunately, the number of suspected familial cancer cases in which a causative mutation is identified is far from ideal. All members from a family with a strong history of cancer and no causative mutation detected are included in a surveillance program. Identification of mutations depends on the specific syndrome and the criteria applied to select patients for genetic analyses.\n\nThe results of sequence-based genetic tests may be reported to physicians as: 1) positive, in which a mutation that clearly disrupts gene function is detected and is highly likely to have clinical consequences; 2) a genetic variant is detected but it is not known whether the variant has any effect on gene function that might confer an increased cancer risk (these variants are known as variants of uncertain/unclassified significance or unclassified variants [UVs]); and 3) negative, in which deleterious variant or UV is detected [1].\n\nThe majority of UVs are missense mutations or small in-frame deletions. The human gene pool harbours a vast number of rare missense substitutions, 70% of which are at least mildly deleterious [2]. Integration of various lines of evidence may help to classify UVs. Information on: 1) frequencies in cases and controls, 2) co-occurrence (in trans) with deleterious mutations, 3) co-segregation with disease in pedigrees, 4) pathological factors, 5) amino acid polarity or size, 6) evolutionary conservation of the residue, 7) splice predictions and 8) in vitro and/or in vivo functional assays may enable UVs to be classified as pathogenic or non-pathogenic [3].\n\nLynch syndrome (MIM# 120435) (LS) is an autosomal dominant inherited cancer syndrome characterized by early onset colorectal cancer (CRC), cancer of the endometrium and tumours of the stomach, pancreas, small intestine, ovary, bladder and bile duct [4]. LS-associated tumours are characterized by DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency, which may be evidenced by microsatellite instability (MSI) or loss of expression of MMR proteins using immunohistochemistry [5]. The proportion of genetic UVs in LS varies from 1/5 to 1/3 of all unique variants detected [6].\n\n",

During the preparation of this manuscript a first assessment of chromosomal expression patterns in CRC in conjunction with genome-wide DNA copy number analyses became available [17]. Tsafrir et al. described a correlation of gene copy number and expression for both, deleted and amplified genes. They claimed that the described alterations become more frequent as the tumors progress from benign to metastatic forms, highlighting the need for a more precise characterization of regions of coordinate expression and gene copy number change. In addition to this most recent work, a substantial body of literature on chromosomal aberrations in CRC has accumulated [7,15,18-25] that could help to interpret findings on islands of coordinated chromosomal expression.\n\nThe need for a more precise definition of chromosomal regions of altered gene expression prompted us to find a new approach to investigate chromosomal co-expression domains in CRC. The focus of our study was the identification of up- or down-regulated gene expression in primary colon carcinoma cells compared to normal colon epithelia of the same patient. By using laser capture microdissection (LCM) we aimed to investigate transcript abundance in relatively pure cell populations, trying to minimize the influence of contaminating stroma tissue or infiltrating peripheral blood cells on expression measurements. The use of Affymetrix DNA microarray technology allowed us to simultaneously assess mRNA levels of all known human genes using only small amounts of cells obtained by LCM. Finally, we developed a new bioinformatic approach to identify regions of chromosomal deregulation which enabled the most precise survey of chromosomal expression domains in colon cancer available today. In particular, we were interested in the question whether our data correlated with the data of Tsafrir et al. who performed genome scale arrayCGH and chip-based expression analyses on a different set of colorectal cancer patients [17]. In contrast to Tsafrir et al. we put more emphasis on the identification of precise boundaries of expression domains and therefore we consider our work as complementary to their pioneering study.\n\n",

The detection limit was 5% mutated DNA and duplicate experiments revealed a good reproducibility (88%) [27].\n\nAPC mutation analysis\n\nThe majority of somatic mutations in the APC gene are found within the mutation cluster region (codons 1286\u20131520). Mutation analysis of the mutation cluster region was performed on adenocarcinoma DNA using nested PCR for amplification of the mutation cluster region as four overlapping DNA fragments followed by direct sequencing of purified fragments, as previously described [28]. An alternative nested PCR strategy was performed when nested PCR failed for any of the fragments, using different primers. The detection limit was 5% mutated DNA and duplicate experiments revealed good reproducibility (85%)[28]. From 72 of the 737 patients with sufficient DNA yield, one or more fragments of the mutation cluster region could not be amplified and these patients were not included in this study.\n\nCTNNB1 mutation analysis\n\nAll 464 samples without a truncating APC mutation (n = 411) and all samples with absent hMLH1 expression (n = 58) were analysed for mutations in the phosphorylation sites at codons 33, 37, 41 and 45 in exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene. This selection was made, since most mutations are expected in these samples. Tumours lacking truncating APC mutations may harbour CTNNB1 mutations [7], and microsatellite instable tumours are also expected to more frequently have mutations in CTNNB1 [26].\n\nAmplification of exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene entailed a semi-nested PCR strategy, which covered codons 33, 37, 41 and 45. Flank PCR was performed to generate a 308 bp fragment (primers, forward: 5'-CCAATCTACTAATGCTAATACTG-3', reverse: 5'-GCATTCTGACTTTCAGTAAGGC-3') that was used in a 1:100 dilution for amplification of the final PCR product (primers, forward: 5'-CCAATCTACTAATGCTAATACTG-3', reverse: 5'-CTTCCTCAGGATTGCCTTTACC-3'). In each PCR, one round of 35 cycles was performed.\n\nThe semi-nested PCR products from samples without a truncating APC mutation were screened for mutations using denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography (dHPLC) on a WAVE 3500 HT system (Transgenomic Inc., UK). WAVE analysis was optimised and validated using specific mutations in cell line DNA, i.e. HCT116 (codon 45: 3 bp deletion) and SW48 (codon 33: C\u2192A) as well as DNA derived from desmoid tumours from patients (codon 41: A\u2192G and codon 45: C\u2192T) as positive controls. All of these mutations were repeatedly confirmed by sequencing. WAVE analysis was carried out at two different temperatures (57.7 en 60\u00b0C). Samples showing an aberrant elution profile were re-amplified and re-screened. When an aberrant elution profile was confirmed, direct sequencing was performed. All samples without hMLH1 expression were analysed by direct sequencing without screening. The sequence profile was analysed on an ALFexpress II DNA analysis system using ALFwin software (Amersham Biosciences, Roosendaal, the Netherlands).\n\n",

Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by 3% H2O2. Slides were submitted to microwave antigen retrieval in 1 mM EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) and incubated with 10% normal horse serum for ten min at room temperature. Then, sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with mouse monoclonal antibodies against hMLH1 protein (clone G168-15, PharMingen, San Diego, CA) at a 1:100 dilution. Antibody binding was detected by incubating the sections at room temperature with the peroxidase-labelled DAKO Envision System (DAKO, Carpinteris, CA), using DAB as a chromogen. Sections were counterstained with diluted haematoxylin.\n\nLesions were considered to lack hMLH1 protein expression when unequivocal absence of nuclear staining of the tumour epithelial cells was observed. Nuclear staining of normal epithelial and stromal cells or lymphocytes served as an internal positive control. Staining was scored independently by at least two observers and in case of discordant results discussed with a pathologist until consensus was reached. hMLH1 expression could be determined in 724 of 737 patients.\n\nBAT-26\n\nAnalysis of the BAT-26 mononucleotide repeat was performed in a random sample of tumour specimens from 114 patients, and a series of 48 of 58 tumours that lacked hMLH1 expression, to assess the concordance between the microsatellite instability marker BAT-26 and hMLH1 expression. The primer sequences and PCR conditions for the BAT-26 mononucleotide repeat were used as described previously [31].\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nIn the statistical analysis, data from 656 patients for whom information on APC and K-ras mutation status as well as hMLH1 expression was complete were included.\n\nThe \u03c72 test and Cram\u00e9rs V test were used to estimate the association of the co-occurrence of K-ras and APC gene mutations. Characteristics of patients (age at diagnosis, sex, family history of colorectal cancer) and tumours (tumour sub-localisation, Dukes' stage and tumour differentiation) were compared between patients with and without an activating K-ras or a truncating APC mutation as well as patients harbouring tumours with and without hMLH1 expression, using Students T-test (age at diagnosis) and \u03c72 tests (sex, family history of colorectal cancer, tumour sub-localisation, Dukes' stage and differentiation). Additionally, patient and tumour characteristics of tumours with an activating K-ras and/or a truncating APC mutation were compared to tumours lacking hMLH1 expression. All P-values are reported for a two-sided test; P-values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\n",

HNPCC is caused by germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes, mostly hMSH2 or hMLH1.\n\nIn this study, we report the analysis for genetic counseling of three first-degree relatives (the mother and two sisters) of a male who died of colorectal adenocarcinoma at the age of 23. The family fulfilled strict Amsterdam-I criteria (AC-I) with the presence of extracolonic tumors in the extended pedigree. We overcame the difficulty of having a proband post-mortem non-tumor tissue sample for MSI testing by studying the alleles carried by his progenitors.\n\nMethods\n\nTumor MSI testing is described as initial screening in both primary and metastasis tumor tissue blocks, using the reference panel of 5 microsatellite markers standardized by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the screening of HNPCC (BAT-25, BAT-26, D2S123, D5S346 and D17S250). Subsequent mutation analysis of the hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes was performed.\n\nResults\n\nThree of five microsatellite markers (BAT-25, BAT-26 and D5S346) presented different alleles in the proband's tumor as compared to those inherited from his parents. The tumor was classified as high frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H). We identified in the HNPCC family a novel germline missense (c.1864C>A) mutation in exon 12 of hMSH2 gene, leading to a proline 622 to threonine (p.Pro622Thr) amino acid substitution.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis approach allowed us to establish the tumor MSI status using the NCI recommended panel in the absence of proband's non-tumor tissue and before sequencing the obligate carrier. According to the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumors (InSiGHT) Database this is the first report of this mutation.\n\n",

Chromosomal gains of this region in CRC have been described by two independent studies [21,25]. Up to 18 of 25 patients show up-regulation of expression in this region. The known tumor gene NME1 (non-metastatic 1; encoding the NM23A protein, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase) is among the most frequently up-regulated genes in this region. Also the paralogous genomic neighbor NME2 which acts in the same pathway is strongly up-regulated. These two genes are possibly the primary targets of regional expression up-regulation. However, up-regulation of several other genes is also remarkable. The up-regulation of the mitochondrial ribosomal component MRPS23 is notable as it is in agreement with other observations of up-regulation of genes acting in translation (see above). Additionally, the RING finger gene FLJ20315/RNF124, possibly encoding a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the suppressor of Ty 4 homologue 1 (SUPT4H1), a putative human chromatin regulator that alters transcription, are genes that are strongly up-regulated and could have the potential to contribute to development of CRC.\n\nUp-regulation of mRNA levels in human chromosomal region 17q21.33-23.2 (T/N relative expression heat map).

The controls were selected from the same hospitals, had no personal histories of cancer and had diagnoses unrelated to the variables of interest. They were matched for age, gender and race/ethnicity with the sporadic CRC patients.\n\nNo familial history of cancer was available from the control group. Patients diagnosed at an age over 50 years and not referred to Genetic Counselling Units were considered as sporadic CRC. Samples from sporadic CRC patients were obtained from the Elche University Hospital BioBank and the Castellon Provincial Hospital BioBank. Written consent to be included in the respective biobanks was obtained from each patient. CRC patients, as index subjects from families with suspicion of LS that attended Genetic Counselling at the Cancer Units of the Elche and La Fe Hospitals, were recruited. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Elche University Hospital.\n\nThe median age of patients in the sporadic CRC group was 70 years (range, 52-93 years), 47 years (range, 21-87 years) for the familial group and 71 years (range, 25-96 years) for the controls. The sex distribution was 58% men and 42% women for the sporadic CRC group and 53.3% men and 46.7% women for the controls.\n\nFamilies carrying the p.Lys618Ala variant\n\nThree characterized LS families that fulfilled the Amsterdam II Criteria and that consisted of members with the p.Lys618Ala variant were included to assess co-occurrence and co-segregation. Two families attended the Genetic Counselling in Cancer Units of the Elche and La Fe Hospitals and one family was a member of the EPICOLON cohort [7].\n\nConcomitant deleterious variants were detected in two of the families: one in the MLH1 gene (c.676C>T; p.Arg226X) and the other in the MSH6 gene (c.3013C>T; p.Arg1005X). Seventeen affected and unaffected family members from these two families were tested for the pathogenic and p.Lys618Ala variants.\n\nGenotyping of the MLH1 p.Lys618Ala variant\n\nDNA from blood cells (familial cancer cases and controls) or colorectal mucosa of normal appearance (sporadic cases) was used for the c.1852_1853AA>GC variant genotyping. This was assessed using the iPLEX Gold method (Sequenom, CA, USA), in which single-base extension and MALDI-TOF technology are employed for allelic discrimination. These experiments were carried out at the Centro Espa\u00f1ol de Genotipado (CEGEN) genotyping platform facilities. Quality control for genotyping was conducted by direct sequencing of familial cancer subjects who underwent genetic analysis for MLH1 (49/1034, 4.7%).\n\n",

Overall, 34 of 188 polyps (18%) had mutation of KRAS. Twenty-eight mutations were in codon 12 (20 G\u2192A, seven G\u2192T and one G\u2192C) and six mutations were in codon 13 (all G\u2192A). One serrated adenoma had two KRAS mutations in codon 12 (G\u2192T at position 35 and T\u2192G at position 36). BRAF mutation at V600E could be assessed in all polyps except for a single TA <\u200a10 mm. BRAF mutation was found in 82 of 189 polyps (43%). BRAF and KRAS mutations were negatively correlated, with only four polyps having both mutations (two TAs, one TVA and one SSA). The three conventional adenomas with mutations of both BRAF and KRAS were among only four adenomas that had any BRAF mutations at all. Mutation frequencies for both KRAS and BRAF were distributed differently across the seven polyp groups (Table 1).\n\nFrequency of KRAS and BRAF mutation and loss of expression of O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) by polyp type\n\nMutation frequencies for both KRAS (P < 0.0001) and BRAF (P < 0.0001) are distributed differently across the seven classes of polyp (see Results for individual comparisons). Distribution of MGMT loss differs across the seven classes of polyp (P < 0.001).\n\nNote: no result for KRAS in one sessile serrated adenoma (SSA) and one tubular adenoma (TA) or for BRAF in one TA. MGMT immunstaining not performed in 15 polyps (seven HPs, one SSA, one MP and six TAs).\n\nKRAS mutation occurred in 26.5% and BRAF mutation in 4.8% of adenomas (all types) (Table 1) (P < 0.0001). TVAs/VAs were more likely to have KRAS mutation (50%) than TAs <\u200a10 mm (18%) (P < 0.004) or TAS >\u200a10 mm in diameter (17%) (P < 0.02). In the case of TAs there was a trend for KRAS mutation to occur more frequently in polyps from the proximal colon (P = 0.08) and in females (P = 0.07).\n\nSSAs were more likely to have BRAF mutation (81%) than either SAs (33%) (P < 0.001) or MPs (40%) (P < 0.02). KRAS mutation was infrequent among both SSAs (3%) and HPs (4%) (Table 1). Patient age, gender and anatomical location were not predictors of BRAF mutation in either SSAs or HPs. The mean age of subjects with SSAs (64 years) differed from that of subjects with HPs (55 years) (P < 0.001).\n\n",

                "text": "Discussion\n\nIn this study, the occurrence of mutations in the APC, CTNNB1 and K-ras genes as well as expression of the hMLH1 protein in tumour tissue of 656 sporadic colorectal cancer cases were investigated. The occurrence of mutations in the CTNNB1 gene, which codes for \u03b2-catenin, was rare: only five of 464 tumours analysed were found to have a mutation at one of the phosphorylation sites in exon 3. Truncating mutations in APC and activating mutations in K-ras appeared to occur at similar frequencies. Although tumours harbouring both mutations were relatively rare, mutations in APC and K-ras seemed to occur co-dependently. Nine percent of all tumours (58/656) lacked hMLH1 expression, and in these tumours almost no APC or K-ras mutations was detected. Patients harbouring a tumour with absent hMLH1 expression were older, more often women, more often had proximal colon tumours that showed poorer differentiation when compared to patients who harboured a tumour with an APC and/or K-ras mutation.\n\nThe selection of patients included in this study was based on the completeness of analyses of both APC and K-ras genes as well as hMLH1 expression and this led to a considerable reduction in the number of cases that could be included in the analyses presented in this study. The largest reduction (72 cases) was due to incompleteness of the analysis of all fragments comprising the APC mutation cluster region. Tumour DNA was derived from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour tissue blocks. Depending on the conditions of fixation and storage, the extracted DNA is more or less fragmented, which may have impaired the analysis of mutations in the APC gene more than in the K-ras gene, since the analysis of the latter is based on the amplification of a smaller gene fragment. It should be emphasized that characteristics of patients (age, sex, family history of colorectal cancer) and tumours (sub-localisation, Dukes' stage and differentiation) of the group under study are similar to the 737 patients for whom tumour material was available and to all 819 patients initially recognized within the cohort (data not shown). Moreover, the K-ras and hMLH1data presented here are similar to the data for K-ras and hMLH1 based on the complete groups (737 and 724 cases, respectively) (data not shown).\n\nMutations in exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene leading to loss of one of the phosphorylation sites were rare. Strikingly, all five of these mutations occurred in the proximal colon and three of these also had absent hMLH1 expression. This may indicate that these proximal colon tumours, which often also show mismatch repair deficiency, are more likely to harbour CTNNB1 mutations. This was also found in a study of microsatellite instable colorectal tumours [26]. The WAVE screening technique has not been used previously for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, and therefore it seems plausible that samples harbouring a CTNNB1 mutation have escaped detection. However, all 58 hMLH1 deficient samples were analysed by direct sequencing without a prior screening step, and only three of these samples harboured a CTNNB1 mutation, indicating the low frequency of such mutations.\n\n",

Briefly, five 4-\u00b5m non-microdissected sections (polyps were generally accompanied by little normal mucosa) and 180 \u00b5l of ATL buffer were dissolved at 80\u00b0C and then digested overnight with 20 \u00b5l of proteinase K at 55\u00b0C. Following centrifugation at 2000 r.p.m. (300 g) for 5 min, the lower phase was applied to a DNeasy tissue column. Bound DNA was washed by centrifugation through ethanol and then eluted from the column using AE buffer.\n\nKRAS and BRAF mutations\n\nKRAS mutation analysis at codons 12 and 13 was performed using direct automated sequencing of a fragment containing codon 12 and 13 in exon 1 of the KRAS gene, amplified using a touchdown polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle and hotstart protocol. PCR products were initially purified and then directly sequenced using BigDye version 3.1 dye terminators and an ABI 3100 DNA fragment analyser. The sequence at codon 12 and 13 was determined using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College, PA, USA) software.\n\nBRAF mutation analysis at codon 600 (V600E; formerly V599E) was performed by a real-time PCR-based allelic discrimination method as previously described.29 Briefly, real-time PCR was performed using allele-specific primers designed to amplify selectively the wild-type (T1796) and mutant (A1796) BRAF alleles. The primer sequences were as follows: V, 5\u2032-GTGATTTTGGTCTAGCTACtGT; E, 5\u2032-CGCGGCCGGCCGCGGCGGTGATTTTGGTCTAGCTACcGA; AS, 5\u2032-TAGCCTCAATTCTTACCATCCAC. PCR amplification and melting curve analysis were performed on a Rotor-gene 3000 (Corbett Research, NSW, Australia). Genomic DNA was amplified in a 15-\u00b5l volume containing 1 \u00d7 Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), forward primer V (300 nm), forward primer E (900 nm) and reverse primer AS (300 nm). The cycling conditions were as follows: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 60 s. After amplification, samples were subjected to a temperature ramp from 60\u00b0C to 99\u00b0C, rising 1\u00b0C each step. For wild-type samples, single peaks were observed at 80\u00b0C while samples containing mutant alleles produced single peaks at 85\u00b0C.\n\np53 immunohistochemistry and scoring\n\nThis was undertaken on all adenomas and all serrated polyps with dysplasia (traditional SA and MP). Most of these polyps had been immunostained previously for MGMT.24 Following deparaffinization and rehydration of 4-\u00b5m sections and antigen retrieval using ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid and microwaving, the sections were subjected to peroxidase blockade (Dako EnVision bottle 1; Mississauga, Canada) and then incubated in 10% goat serum to minimize non-specific staining. They were subsequently incubated with the primary anti-p53 antibody (DO-7, from DakoCytomation, Mississauga, Canada) at a dilution of 1 : 100 for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. After washing, the sections were incubated with secondary antibody (EnVision bottle 2) for 30 min, washed again and then developed with the chromogen AEC for 30 min. Finally, the sections were counterstained with Gill's haematoxylin. Polyps were scored as showing loss of expression of MGMT if there was complete absence of nuclear expression throughout one or more crypts. Polyps were scored as positive for aberrant p53 expression if there were distinct subclones characterized by strong nuclear expression that implicated at least 50% of nuclei.\n\n",

The detailed analysis of expression along the chromosome in windows of sizes 5, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51 genes resulted in the identification of 251 partially overlapping intervals of up- or down-regulation (see Additional file 1). These intervals were condensed in 81 non-overlapping regions of expression imbalance: 43 regions with loss of expression and 38 regions with gain of expression (see Table 1). We determined the fraction of affected genes on each chromosome (see Table 2). In total, 25.3% of all genes under consideration show expression imbalance. Slightly more genes lie in chromosomal regions that show loss of expression (13.3%) than gain (12%) of expression. The fractions of genes with gain or loss of expression vary strikingly from chromosome to chromosome. Chromosomes 9, 10, 15, 18, and 22 showed only regional expression loss, whereas 8, 13, 20, and X showed only regional increase in expression. There were too few informative genes on chromosome Y to carry out a full analysis using all window sizes, but small window sizes did not reveal significant deregulation.\n\nWhole-chromosome plots of running average of fractions of samples showing up-/down-regulation in tumor versus normal samples (Chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4).

                "text": "The model describing the accumulation of genetic alterations of the APC, K-ras, TP53 and SMAD4 genes that drive the development of a carcinoma, has become generally accepted as a paradigm for the genetic basis of colorectal carcinogenesis [3,32]. The relatively low frequency of simultaneous occurrence of mutations in both APC and K-ras observed in this study seems to argue against this synergy. This contention is in accordance with observations from another cohort study, in which APC, K-ras and TP53 gene mutations were studied in 109 tumours and these mutations were found to rarely occur together in the same tumour [9]. However, the simultaneous occurrence of APC and K-ras mutations observed in our study occurs more frequently than expected based on chance alone and therefore mutations in the APC and K-ras genes do not seem to occur independently. When data on APC and K-ras mutations are derived from the study by Smith et al. [9], similar results, although not statistically significant, could be obtained.\n\nThe K-ras mutation frequency of 37% is in accordance with reported frequencies of 30 to 60% [33-43]. The frequency of 37% of truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region of APC in this study, however, seems low in comparison to the general assumption that most colorectal tumours harbour a mutation in the APC gene. When only reports from studies on sporadic rather than familial colorectal cancer or colorectal cancer cell lines are considered, the mutation frequencies are lower and vary between 30 and 70% [17,44-49], and a population-based case-control study in the Netherlands reported a 32% mutation frequency [50].\n\nThe method for mutation analysis of the APC mutation cluster region and exon 1 of K-ras is based on nested amplification and direct sequencing of purified PCR fragments, a highly sensitive method. Since no screening step was performed prior to the sequencing of the gene fragments, it is unlikely that mutations would have escaped detection. The reproducibility of the applied assays was good, with a reproducibility of 85% and 88% for APC and K-ras, respectively. Arguably, this indicates the extent of heterogeneity present in the tumour samples.\n\nIn 103 sporadic colorectal cancers no alterations were found in the K-ras, APC or hMLH1 genes. It is plausible that these tumours have harboured mutations in other components of the Wnt signalling pathway, e.g. mutations in the Axin genes, which are essential for the degradation of \u03b2-catenin, and were observed in 11% of patient samples [51]. In addition, an epi-genetic change, i.e. promotor hypermethylation of the APC gene that leads to impaired APC function has been observed in 18% of sporadic colorectal adenomas and carcinomas [52].\n\n",

The study design has been described in detail elsewhere [29]. The study population originated from 204 municipal population registries throughout the Netherlands, and included a total of 58,279 men and 62,573 women between the ages of 55 and 69 years at baseline.\n\nIncident cancer cases are identified by monitoring of the entire cohort for cancer occurrence through annual record linkage to the Netherlands Cancer Registry, i.e. nine regional cancer registries throughout the Netherlands, and to PALGA, a nationwide network and registry of histo- and cytopathology [30]. Together, the NCR and PALGA provide a near 100% coverage of the municipalities included in the NLCS. The first 2.3 years of follow up were excluded because of possible pre-clinical disease affecting exposure status and because of incomplete nationwide coverage of PALGA in some of the municipalities included in the NLCS in that period. From 1989 until 1994, 929 incident cases with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer were identified within the cohort, of whom 819 could also be linked to a PALGA report of the lesion.\n\nThe PALGA reports were used to identify and locate tumour tissue from eligible colorectal cancer patients in Dutch pathology laboratories. Colon and rectal cancer were classified according to site as follows, colon: cecum through sigmoid colon (ICD-O codes 153.0, 153.1, 153.2, 153.3, 153.4, 153.5, 153.6, 153.7), rectosigmoid (ICD-O code 154.0), and rectum (ICD-O code 154.1).\n\nTissue samples\n\nTumour material of colorectal cancer patients was collected after approval by the Ethical Review Board of Maastricht University, PALGA and the NCR. Tissue samples from 819 colorectal cancer patients were localized in 54 pathology laboratories throughout the Netherlands. Forty-four (5%) tumour tissue samples could not be retrieved from the pathology archives. Of 775 available tissue samples, 737 (95%) contained sufficient tumour material for molecular analyses. Tissue sections were cut from each sample, which were used for DNA isolation and immunohistochemical analysis.\n\nDNA isolation\n\nDNA isolation was described in detail elsewhere [27]. Briefly, a 4 \u03bcm section, cut from each paraffin-embedded tumour tissue block, was stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE) for histopathological examination by a pathologist. Five 20 \u03bcm sections of tumour tissue were cut from each sample for DNA isolation. Tumour tissue was separated from normal colon epithelium using the HE section as a reference. Genomic DNA was extracted from macrodissected tumour tissue using proteinase K (Qiagen, St. Louis, MO, USA) and the Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). DNA concentration and purity was measured at 260 and 280 nm.\n\n",

The identities and numbers of mutations required for transformation are uncertain, but perhaps six general cellular functions are typically altered [2]. Numbers of oncogenic mutations may also be inferred from the age-related increases in frequencies observed with many cancer types. For example, logarithms of cancer frequencies versus age typically yield straight lines, with slopes proportional to numbers of cancer mutations [3].\n\nColorectal cancer epidemiology is consistent with approximately five to seven oncogenic mutations before transformation [3-6]. The variability in estimated numbers of mutations may reflect a number of differences. For example, estimates vary between populations, with five to six mutations in England and six to seven mutations in Finland [4]. Recent advances in cancer genetics also reveal biologic colorectal cancer heterogeneity. Approximately 5% of all colorectal cancers have strong familial predispositions and arise in individuals with germline mutations in critical susceptibility loci [7]. Such hereditary cancers (familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)) typically present at younger ages and should require fewer somatic mutations than their sporadic counterparts because one mutation is inherited.\n\nGenetic instability also divides colorectal cancers into two groups [8]. Approximately 10 to 15% of sporadic cancers exhibit microsatellite instability (MSI) secondary to somatic loss of DNA mismatch repair (MMR). Most other cancers exhibit chromosomal instability (CIN) characterized by aneuploidy and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) [7,8]. CIN and MSI+ colorectal cancers have different characteristics with respect to mutated loci, tumor location, morphology, and clinical outcomes [7,8].\n\nNumbers of oncogenic mutations may differ between cancer subtypes. Therefore, colorectal cancers arising in a population-based setting were molecularly classified as either sporadic or hereditary, and MSI+ or MSI-. Cancers were also classified with respect to clinical stage because additional mutations may be required for invasion or metastasis. Ages at cancer for each subgroup were used to infer numbers of mutations required for each type of colorectal cancer.\n\n",

                "text": "Evidence for classification of c.1852_1853AA>GC in MLH1 as a neutral variant for Lynch syndrome\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\n\nLynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant inherited cancer syndrome characterized by early onset cancers of the colorectum, endometrium and other tumours. A significant proportion of DNA variants in LS patients are unclassified. Reports on the pathogenicity of the c.1852_1853AA>GC (p.Lys618Ala) variant of the MLH1 gene are conflicting. In this study, we provide new evidence indicating that this variant has no significant implications for LS.\n\nMethods\n\nThe following approach was used to assess the clinical significance of the p.Lys618Ala variant: frequency in a control population, case-control comparison, co-occurrence of the p.Lys618Ala variant with a pathogenic mutation, co-segregation with the disease and microsatellite instability in tumours from carriers of the variant. We genotyped p.Lys618Ala in 1034 individuals (373 sporadic colorectal cancer [CRC] patients, 250 index subjects from families suspected of having LS [revised Bethesda guidelines] and 411 controls). Three well-characterized LS families that fulfilled the Amsterdam II Criteria and consisted of members with the p.Lys618Ala variant were included to assess co-occurrence and co-segregation. A subset of colorectal tumour DNA samples from 17 patients carrying the p.Lys618Ala variant was screened for microsatellite instability using five mononucleotide markers.\n\nResults\n\nTwenty-seven individuals were heterozygous for the p.Lys618Ala variant; nine had sporadic CRC (2.41%), seven were suspected of having hereditary CRC (2.8%) and 11 were controls (2.68%). There were no significant associations in the case-control and case-case studies. The p.Lys618Ala variant was co-existent with pathogenic mutations in two unrelated LS families. In one family, the allele distribution of the pathogenic and unclassified variant was in trans, in the other family the pathogenic variant was detected in the MSH6 gene and only the deleterious variant co-segregated with the disease in both families. Only two positive cases of microsatellite instability (2/17, 11.8%) were detected in tumours from p.Lys618Ala carriers, indicating that this variant does not play a role in functional inactivation of MLH1 in CRC patients.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe p.Lys618Ala variant should be considered a neutral variant for LS. These findings have implications for the clinical management of CRC probands and their relatives.\n\n",

It was considered as unstable if there was an absence, shortening or prolongation of the DNA sequence. MSI-L was defined as 1 unstable microsatellite out of 5, while MSI-H was defined as more than 1 unstable microsatellite out of 5. If the tumor microsatellites were identical to those of the normal tissue, the microsatellite was considered as stable (MSS).\n\nFor the MSI-L CRCs, BAT-40 and MYCL were detected. If either of these two markers was unstable, this colorectal sample was considered as MSI-H.\n\nImmunohistochemical staining for MSH2, MSH6 and MLH1 on TMAs\n\nThe CRC microarray was constructed as previously described [8,9]. Briefly, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of CRC resections were cut from the donor block and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). These slides were used to guide the sampling from morphologically representative regions of the tissues. A tissue array instrument (Beecher Instruments, Silver Spring, MD) was used to create holes in a recipient paraffin block and to acquire tissue cores from the donor block by a thin-walled needle with an inner diameter of 1.0 mm, held in an X-Y precision guide. The cylindrical samples were retrieved from the selected regions in the donors and extruded directly into the recipient blocks with defined array coordinates. Three cores were obtained from each sample. After the construction of the array block, multiple 4-mm thick sections were cut with a microtome using an adhesive-coated tape sectioning system (Instrumedics, Hackensack, NJ). In our analysis the rates of lost cases attributable to tissue damage were less than 5% for the different markers.\n\nTMA slides were stained with MLH1 antibodies (1:50 dilution, No. sc-494, Santa Cruz, Biotrade Ltd, Shanghai, China) and MSH2 (1:100 dilution, No. sc-581, Santa Cruz, Biotrade Ltd, Shanghai, China). IHC staining for samples on the tissue microarray was carried out using Envision ready-to-use methods (Dako Diagnostics, Zug, Switzerland). Slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded concentrations of ethanol to distilled water, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation with 30 mL/L H2O2 in methanol for 10 min at room temperature. Then sections were submitted to antigen retrieval in a pressure cooker containing 0.01 mmol/L natrium citricium buffer for 10 min. Slides were subsequently incubated in 100 mL/L normal goat serum for 20 min at room temperature. Sections were permeabilized in PBS-Triton and incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4\u00b0C. The pathologist and technician who reviewed the immunostaining of the tissue samples were blinded to the patient's information. Stained slides and individual cores were scored as either positive (showing nuclear staining in at least some tumor cells) or negative.\n\n",

Progression to metastasis may involve a long sequence of potentially rate limiting steps [21]. If invasion or metastasis depends on mutations that arise after transformation, advanced cancers should require more oncogenic mutations and more time for progression (Figure 2). However, ages at diagnosis and estimated mutation numbers did not markedly differ between cancers of different clinical stages.\n\nEquivalent numbers of mutations regardless of clinical stage are consistent with recent speculation that an invasive potential is acquired early in progression [22], albeit only rare cells actually form visible metastases. Primary breast cancer expression patterns correlate with clinical outcomes or metastases [22-25], suggesting that a propensity to spread is already present at the time of transformation. Alternatively, all cancers may have the same abilities to invade and metastasize, with clinical stage dependent on random events that occur rapidly after transformation. A short interval between transformation and detection may help limit spread because clinical surveillance tends to detect localized colorectal cancers [26-28].\n\nMultistage models are mechanistically different from tumor progression models and more consistent with a hypothesis that mutations acquired early during progression help determine extent of invasion (Figure 3). Mutations sequentially accumulate before transformation in both models, but the adenoma-cancer sequence suggests most cancer mutations start to accumulate after the age of 50 years in adenomas [7]. Such tumor progression imposes purpose to early mutations because each additional mutation confers incremental changes to a non-invasive adenoma phenotype. Therefore, tumor progression models would likely differ between MSI+ and MSI- cancers because their biology and types of mutations are quite different [7,8].\n\nIn contrast, mutations accumulate throughout life in multistage models. Genetically engineered mice and familial cancer syndromes reveal that many oncogenic mutations are also compatible with normal phenotypes [11], allowing for the possibility that many \"cancer\" mutations may first accumulate in normal-appearing colon very early in life. Such pretumor progression [11] more readily allows for an invasive or metastatic cancer phenotype at transformation because genetic progression is uncoupled from tumor progression (Figure 2). Rather than incremental stepwise changes in phenotype after each new mutation, a tumor phenotype may only emerge after several initially occult mutations accumulate in a single normal appearing cell. In this way our multistage model can apply to both MSI+ and MSI- cancers despite their marked differences in types of mutations because early critical mutations (whatever they are) do not visibly change phenotype but instead accumulate in normal appearing colon. Early or advanced sporadic MSI- colorectal cancers appeared to require similar numbers of mutations, consistent with the phenotype at cancer diagnosis contingent on mutations acquired much earlier in life and present at the time of transformation. However, ascertainment bias may also be responsible for the similar frequency-age distributions of colorectal cancers of different clinical stages.\n\n",

Two out of 17 MSI-L CRCs were unstable with BAT-40 and were judged as MSI-H. Seven out of 17 MSI-H CRCs were unstable with BAT-40. In all, 19 CRCs (55.9%) were MSI-H and 15 cancers (44.1%) were MSI-L. The remaining 112 patients (76.8% were MSS.

One MSI-H CRC was negative for both MSH6 and MSH2. Seventeen CRCs stained negatively for MLH1. Negative staining was not found in three MSI CRCs, and one CRC was found with negative MLH1 staining, but it was MSS.\n\nMLH1 promoter methylation was determined in 34 MSI CRCs. Hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter occurred in 14 (73.7%) out of 19 MSI-H CRCs and 5 (33.3%) out 15 MSI-L CRCs.

Patients in the MSS group are younger than those in MSI group (70.9 \u00b1 17.8 versus 61.0 \u00b1 9.4, p = 0.045). Twenty out of 34 (59%) MSI patients were stage III or stage IV, significantly higher than those (35.7%) in the MSS group (p = 0.008). There were no differences in other demographic and clinical pathological features, including sex, tumor location and type between the two groups. The most common location of the tumor was the rectum in both groups, accounting for more than 50% of the cases. Adenocarcinoma was the most common pathological type in both groups.

Nevertheless, those serrated polyps with dysplasia show frequent mutation of either KRAS or BRAF and frequent loss of expression of MGMT (particularly MP). Additionally, four of 25 (16%) showed high-grade dysplasia and in three of these there was concordant aberrant nuclear expression of p53. Along with SSAs, these rare polyps may serve as the precursors of sporadic CRCs with BRAF mutation and DNA methylation (with and without DNA MSI) and a subset of CRCs with KRAS mutation. Their malignant potential is explained by the accumulation of genetic alterations that may in turn depend upon the inactivation of the DNA repair gene MGMT.28 The importance of these \u2018fusion\u2019 polyps as cancer precursors may be under-appreciated because critical rate-limiting changes governing malignant transition, particularly in association with loss of function of MLH1 of p53, occur rapidly and can rarely be \u2018caught in the act\u2019.\n\n",

The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of mismatch repair (MMR) inactivation in ovarian cancer and its association with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\nMethods\n\nWe determined, microsatellite instability (MSI) as a marker for MMR inactivation (analysis of BAT25 and BAT26), MLH1 promoter methylation status (methylation specific PCR on bisulfite treated DNA) and mRNA expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6 and PMS2 (quantitative RT-PCR) in 75 ovarian carcinomas and eight ovarian cancer cell lines\n\nResults\n\nMSI was detected in three of the eight cell lines i.e. A2780 (no MLH1 mRNA expression due to promoter methylation), SKOV3 (no MLH1 mRNA expression) and 2774 (no altered expression of MMR genes). Overall, there was no association between cisplatin response and MMR status in these eight cell lines.\n\nSeven of the 75 ovarian carcinomas showed MLH1 promoter methylation, however, none of these showed MSI. Forty-six of these patients received platinum-based chemotherapy (11 non-responders, 34 responders, one unknown response). The resistance seen in the eleven non-responders was not related to MSI and therefore also not to MMR inactivation.\n\nConclusion\n\nNo MMR inactivation was detected in 75 ovarian carcinoma specimens and no association was seen between MMR inactivation and resistance in the ovarian cancer cell lines as well as the ovarian carcinomas. In the discussion, the results were compared to that of twenty similar studies in the literature including in total 1315 ovarian cancer patients. Although no association between response and MMR status was seen in the primary tumor the possible role of MMR inactivation in acquired resistance deserves further investigation.\n\n",

A smaller proportion of cancers shows mismatch repair deficiency. The aim of this study was to analyse the co-occurrence of these genetic alterations in relation to tumour and patient characteristics.\n\nMethods\n\nIn a group of 656 unselected sporadic colorectal cancer patients, aberrations in the APC, K-ras, CTNNB1 genes, and expression of hMLH1 were investigated. Additionally, tumours were divided in groups based on molecular features and compared with respect to patient's age at diagnosis, sex, family history of colorectal cancer, tumour sub-localisation, Dukes' stage and differentiation.\n\nResults\n\nMutations at the phosphorylation sites (codons 31, 33, 37, and 45) in the CTNNB1 gene were observed in tumours from only 5/464 patients. Tumours with truncating APC mutations and activating K-ras mutations in codons 12 and 13 occurred at similar frequencies (37% (245/656) and 36% (235/656), respectively). Seventeen percent of tumours harboured both an APC and a K-ras mutation (109/656). Nine percent of all tumours (58/656) lacked hMLH1 expression. Patients harbouring a tumour with absent hMLH1 expression were older, more often women, more often had proximal colon tumours that showed poorer differentiation when compared to patients harbouring tumours with an APC and/or K-ras mutation.\n\nConclusion\n\nCTNNB1 mutations seem to be of minor importance in sporadic colorectal cancer. The main differences in tumour and patient characteristics are found between groups of patients based on mismatch repair deficiency.\n\n",

This is a very important issue for population-based screening programs that aim to identify CRC associated with the HNPCC syndrome. Compared to the analysis of MLH1 promoter methylation, mutation at the BRAF V600E hotspot is relatively simple to detect using DNA sequencing, RFLP or the SSCP method used in the present work (Figure 1).\n\nSimilar to other studies [4,5,10,16,17] we observed BRAF mutation frequencies of 4% in MSI- tumors and 39% in MSI+ tumors (Table 1). The highest frequencies were seen in tumors showing methylation of the MLH1 promoter proximal region (46%) and in tumors with infiltrating lymphocytes (48%). BRAF mutation frequencies of up to 70\u201380% have been reported in sporadic MSI+, CIMP+ and MLH1-methylated CRC and polyps [7,8,15,16]. For reasons that are still unclear, BRAF mutations are approximately 5\u201310-fold more frequent in tumors that have characteristic features of sporadic MSI+ (ie. MLH1 methylated) and CIMP+ phenotypes. These include proximal colon location, poor differentiation, mucinous histology and infiltrating lymphocytes [13,19,20]. Interestingly however, in the present study BRAF mutations never occurred in association with KRAS mutation, were present in only 3% of CIMP- tumors and showed no association with TP53 mutation (Table 2). The observation that BRAF mutations occur only very rarely in HNPCC-related MSI+ CRC demonstrates that defective DNA mismatch repair is not involved in causing this genetic alteration.\n\nIn order to determine whether the characteristic clinicopathological features of tumors with BRAF mutation were due to their close association with MSI+ and CIMP+, we stratified tumours according to these phenotypes. Despite having only 9 MSI-/BRAF mutant and 5 CIMP-/BRAF mutant tumors, the results showed that associations between BRAF mutation and the morphological properties of tumor-infiltrating infiltrating lymphocytes, poor histological grade and mucinous phenotype were retained (Tables 3 and 4).\n\nThe frequencies of BRAF mutation observed in MSI- (4%) and MSI+ (39%) tumors in the present study compare favourably (5% and 52%, respectively) to those reported recently in another large, population-based study [17]. Although BRAF mutations are much more frequent in MSI+ tumors, the comparative rarity of this phenotype means that a considerable proportion occur in MSI- tumors. In the present study, 43% of all BRAF mutations occurred in MSI- tumors compared to 48% in the study by Samowitz et al [17]. BRAF mutations were reported to show prognostic significance in MSI- but not in MSI+ CRC [17]. The lack of follow-up information on CRC patients in the current study and the small number of BRAF mutations (n = 21) meant that we were unable to evaluate the prognostic significance of BRAF mutation according to MSI status.\n\n",

We used these constraints for decision whether a gene is expressed or not due to validation results of several gene expression pattern by quantitative RT-PCR and/or Northern Blot analysis in our lab (data not shown).\n\nFor each patient and probeset an expression ratio was calculated according to the following rules: If expression was detectable in both the normal and tumor sample (Wilcoxon test p <= 0.10 and relative expression value PMQ >= 4), the ratio PMQ(T)/PMQ(N) is our expression ratio (hereafter called T/N). If expression was undetectable in either the normal or the tumor sample, the expression ratio was either set to T/N = 2 (normal absent) or to T/N = 0.5 (tumor absent). If expression was undetectable in both the normal and tumor sample, no expression ratio was calculated and we call the probe set not informative. For each probe set the number of cases which showed an up-regulation (T/N >= 2), a down-regulation (T/N <= 0.5) or the number of unchanged transcription levels (0.5 < T/N < 2) were counted. We filtered out those probe sets which are not informative in any patient, reducing the number of probe sets to 19404. To eliminate redundancy of probe sets with respect to genes, we kept only the most informative probe set of a single gene, i.e. the probe set which is informative in the highest number of matched sample pairs. Additionally, only probe sets that could unambiguously be linked to a particular genomic locus were considered (chromosome band and position; see Affymetrix U133A/B annotation files). Finally, the pre-processing resulted in a total number of 10.935 probe sets which were the basis of all further analyses.\n\n",

However, several studies have described low frequencies of p53 expression in TAs with low-grade dysplasia45,46 and even in VAs.47 Conversely, there is general agreement that aberrant p53 expression is closely associated with the presence of high-grade dysplasia amounting to carcinoma in situ.34,46,48 Aberrant retention of presumed mutant nuclear p53 was rarely observed in the present series, although it occurred more frequently in serrated polyps with dysplasia (12%) than in adenomas (1%). One of the polyps with aberrant expression of p53 was a mixed polyp with BRAF mutation (Figure 1B). Had it not been removed, this polyp may have progressed within a short time frame to the subset of CRC with BRAF mutation, DNA methylation, TP53 mutation and DNA microsatellite stable status (a \u2018fusion\u2019 pathway shown in Table 3).49,50\n\nLoss of expression of the DNA repair gene MGMT is associated with methylation of the promoter region45,51,52 and the latter change has been linked causatively with G:C to A:T transition mutations in TP53.53 In the present study, complete or partial loss of expression of MGMT coincided with aberrant nuclear expression of p53 in three serrated polyps with dysplasia (Figure 2), but not in the single tubular adenoma with aberrant p53 expression. Only one previous study has attempted to correlate MGMT and p53 expression in colorectal polyps.45 In that study, 4.3% of adenomas showed aberrant p53 expression but none had loss of MGMT. It is possible that the link between MGMT silencing and TP53 mutation is more evident in the serrated pathway than in the adenoma\u2013carcinoma sequence. The frequency of TP53 mutation in SAs has ranged from 5 to 50% in the literature.39,41,54 Although a link between MGMT loss and aberrant expression of p53 is supported by the present findings, it should be noted that only a small number of polyps showed these changes concurrently.\n\nKRAS mutation has been linked to the initiation of hyperplastic aberrant crypt foci and small HPs7,38,55 and is therefore closely associated with the development of glandular serration. While the acquisition of KRAS mutation is also observed in adenomas, this change is correlated with the development of a villous architecture and in some cases the presence of epithelial serration (see Discussion of Group B serrated polyps above). It may therefore be conceptually correct to view KRAS mutation as adding a serrated molecular signature to the traditional adenoma and hence providing an additional \u2018fusion\u2019 pathway. However, a mechanistic link between KRAS mutation and the morphogenesis of serration and villous change remains to be established. MGMT is again implicated in this second type of \u2018fusion\u2019 since methylation and inactivation of this DNA repair gene has been linked to G:C to A:T transitions in KRAS.56\u201358 In this study there was an association between loss of expression of MGMT and KRAS mutation among small TAs (P = 0.04) but not in the other polyp categories. Methylation of MGMT occurs in normal colorectal mucosa,59 as well as in polyps, and is therefore unlikely to serve as a key rate-limiting step in the transition to malignancy. A possible third \u2018fusion\u2019 pathway implicating KRAS and methylation of APC60 is included in Table 3.\n\n",

The study was approved by the local ethical committee and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Rectal cancer patients receiving neo-adjuvant radiochemotherapy were excluded from this study.\n\nTissue samples and UV-laser microdissection\n\nTransmural cancer specimens were snap frozen (liquid nitrogen) within 20 minutes following excision and stored at -80\u00b0C. All tissue samples were evaluated by a pathologist before and during laser micro-dissection to ensure an enrichment of vital tumor cells. Six-micron serial frozen sections were cut on a standard cryostat and mounted on RNase-free foil (2,5 \u03bcm) coated on glass slides followed by immediate fixation (70% ethanol for 30s), H&E staining, and ethanol dehydration (70%, 95% and finally 100% ethanol). After vacuum drying the membranes carrying the sections were manually turned and coated on new RNase free glass slides. Optically transparent CapSure LCM caps (ARCTURUS, CA) were placed on the foil over a selected field of cells. Vital colorectal epithelial carcinoma cells (> 90% proportion) from the invasion front were isolated using UV-LCM Systems from PALM (Microlaser Technologie, Germany) and SL (Microtest GmbH, Germany). After visual control of completeness of dissection the captured cells were immersed in denaturation buffer (GTC Extraction Buffer, 2% beta-mercaptoethanol, Promega, WI) and stored at -80\u00b0C.\n\nmRNA-extraction, cRNA-preparation and -amplification\n\nPoly(A)+ RNAs were isolated using PolyATtract 1000 kit (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For each sample the cDNA synthesis and repetitive in vitro transcription were performed three times, as described previously [38-40]. In brief, the total amount of prepared mRNA from one sample was used. First strand cDNA synthesis was initiated using the Affymetrix T7-oligo-dT promoter-primer combination. The second strand cDNA was synthesized by internal priming. In vitro transcription was performed using Ambion's Megascript kit (Ambion, Huntington, UK) as recommended by the manufacturer. From the generated cRNA a new first strand synthesis was initiated using 0.025 mM of a random hexamer as primer. After completion, the second strand synthesis was primed using the Affymetrix T7-oligo-dT promoter-primer combination at a concentration of 0.1 mM. A second in vitro transcription was performed and then the procedure was repeated one additional time. During the third in vitro transcription biotin-labeled nucleotides were incorporated into the cRNA as recommended by the Affymetrix protocol.\n\nMicroarray hybridization\n\nBIO+cRNAs were hybridized on Affymetrix Human Genome U133A and U133B GeneChips, that consist of 44.928 probe sets (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Fragmentation, preparation of hybridization cocktails, hybridization, washing, staining and scanning of Affymetrix GeneChip were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols.\n\n",

Defined by the International Collaborative group on HNPCC, the typical HNPCC family fulfill the following criteria (referred to as the Amsterdam-I criteria [3]): 1. Three or more relatives with histologically verified colorectal cancer, one of whom is a first-degree relative of the other two; 2. Colorectal cancer affecting at least 2 successive generations; and 3. At least one relative diagnosed with colorectal cancer under the age of 50. The fulfillment of these criteria prompted further genetics investigations. More recently it has been revised to take into account the prevalence of extracolonic cancer in certain HNPCC families [4].\n\nThis autosomal dominantly inherited disorder is caused by germline mutations in genes coding proteins responsible for the repair of DNA replication errors, which are referred to as DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes [5]. DNA mismatch repair machinery plays a critical role in genomic stability, including correction of mispaired bases associated with DNA replication and recombination. Germline mutations in one allele of any of these genes followed by the somatic loss or inactivation of the wild-type allele leads to a defective mismatch repair mechanism. The current \"gold standard\" for assessing tumor DNA MMR activity is molecular microsatellite instability (MSI) testing. In most cases, it involves extracting DNA from both tumor and normal tissue. The DNA is subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of five or more different chromosomal loci that compare \"microsatellites\", running the PCR products through a gel to separate DNA fragments by size, comparing the tumor-normal pairs, and scoring for differences between the two. Instability at two or more out of five markers defines a tumor as MSI-H and prompts further analysis, as sequencing of DNA MMR genes. A number of them have been associated with HNPCC, including hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2, hMSH3, and hMSH6. Most of the HNPCC families in which mutations have been identified involved hMSH2 and hMLH1 genes [6].\n\nA much less labor-intensive alternative method used to prescreen high-risk individuals for further germline mutation analysis is immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing for MLH1 and MSH2 expression. IHC testing may identify which gene to target for analysis.\n\nWe describe MSI testing in the absence of proband non-tumor tissue using the Bethesda consensus panel (mononucleotide repeats BAT25 and BAT26, and dinucleotide repeats D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250) and we report a novel hMSH2 germline mutation found in the family.\n\n",

Recommendations for the management of patients with colorectal polyps currently recognize only a single principal type of clinically important polyp: the adenoma. The current study includes additional types of polyp that are likely to have malignant potential, namely serrated polyps with (MP and SA) and without (SSA) dysplasia. This discussion will focus first on adenomas, second on non-dysplastic serrated polyps and will then conclude with the concept that features of these two types of polyp can co-occur or become \u2018fused\u2019 in subtypes of advanced polyps with mixed cytomorphology (hyperplastic and dysplastic) and a serrated and/or villous architecture.\n\nAdenomas\n\nThe adenomas in this study were grouped as TAs <\u200a10 mm, TAs >\u200a10 mm and TVAs/VAs. Overall, KRAS mutation occurred in 26.5% of adenomas while BRAF mutation was detected in only 4.8%. Three of the four BRAF mutations occurred in adenomas that also had KRAS mutation. It is well established that BRAF and KRAS mutation rarely occur in the same colorectal neoplasm.12,16,30 Furthermore, BRAF mutations are much more typical of serrated polyps than adenomas.14,31 The assay for BRAF mutation used in this study was highly sensitive and it is possible that the mutation was being identified in normal mucosa included with the polyp. KRAS mutation may occur within apparently normal colorectal mucosa and the same could apply to BRAF.32 Therefore, the finding of BRAF mutation in a small subset of adenomas could be spurious and the true incidence of BRAF mutation in colorectal adenomas could be lower than 4.8%. BRAF mutation frequencies of 0%14 and 3%31 have been reported in other series of colorectal adenomas.\n\nIn previous studies of KRAS in colorectal adenomas, mutation has been associated negatively with flat and depressed TAs and positively with polypoid appearance, increasing size, dysplasia, villous change and synchronous colorectal cancer.6,33\u201335 In by far the largest study, which included 738 adenomas obtained from 639 participants in a dietary intervention trial, multivariate analysis showed that the independent predictors of KRAS mutation were age of subject, presence of villous architecture and high-grade dysplasia, but not size of adenoma.6 It is well known that adenoma size, dysplasia and villous architecture are interrelated and account has to be taken of this in assessing results. In this study KRAS mutation occurred with the same frequency in small (18%) and large (17%) adenomas but was significantly more frequent in adenomas that included a villous architecture (50%). A previous study showed a very high frequency of KRAS mutation (93%) in flat adenomas with a tubulovillous architecture.34 We would agree with the suggestion that KRAS mutation is linked with the development of villous change and does not influence adenoma growth in an independent manner.6 In this study, high-grade dysplasia was diagnosed only when it amounted to carcinoma in situ. This was observed in none of the 84 adenomas but in four serrated polyps, of which three showed aberrant expression of p53 and the fourth had KRAS mutation. Age was not a predictor of KRAS mutation in this study. However, many of the patients were undergoing continuing colonoscopic surveillance for colorectal polyps and it is known that after clearance of large polyps, time is required for the growth of newly initiated polyps.36 This could explain why adenomas were smaller in subjects aged >\u200a60 years than in subjects aged <\u200a60 years (data not shown).\n\n",

Establishing a risk profile on the basis of the traditional features of adenoma is therefore not always straightforward.\n\nThe addition of molecular profiling to polyp description offers hope of a more objective and therefore reproducible approach to the classification of colorectal adenomas. The genetic evolutionary paradigm envisages a linear sequence of changes beginning with bi-allelic inactivation of APC, followed by oncogenic KRAS mutation and culminating in inactivation of TP53 at the transition from adenoma to carcinoma.5 While there is good evidence that KRAS mutation is associated with advanced adenoma features6 and could therefore be used as objective evidence of aggression, this approach has a number of limitations. First, KRAS mutation also occurs frequently in dysplastic aberrant crypt foci (microadenomas) and in some small tubular adenomas, suggesting that KRAS mutation may initiate a subset of small adenomas with limited potential for progression.6,7 Second, around 70% of CRCs lack mutation of KRAS.8 From this it follows that most of the precancerous lesions that eventually become cancers do not in fact have KRAS mutation. There is increasing evidence that CRC evolves through a number of pathways and the traditional adenoma\u2013carcinoma sequence, with its accompanying genetic steps, provides a surprisingly narrow window of understanding of this multipathway reality.9\n\nIn recent years, the fundamental division of colorectal polyps into precancerous adenomas and innocent HPs has begun to erode and the concept of an alternative serrated pathway has gained support. This revision began with the description of an intermediate lesion described as serrated adenoma (SA).10 Initially, however, SA was not conceived as an intermediate category of polyp but essentially as an adenoma with a superimposed serrated architecture that conferred only a superficial likeness to a HP.10 Additionally, the mixed polyp (MP) was perceived as a chance collision between a HP and an adenoma, giving a combined polyp. These preliminary interpretations did not represent a major departure from the traditional classification of colorectal polyps but preserved the fundamental distinction of neoplastic adenomas versus non-neoplastic HPs.\n\n",

However, platinum treatment does seem to select for MMR deficient cells since in vitro enrichment for MLH1 deficient colon cancer HCT116 cells in a mixed cell population was seen after cisplatin treatment [53]. In addition, several in vivo studies found an increase in the percentage of MSI and MLH1 methylation after platinum-based chemotherapy as well as a decrease in the percentage of cells positive for MLH1 and MSH2 [14,19,25,52]. Moreover, an increase in MLH1 methylation after platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with poor survival in ovarian cancer patients [19]. These results as well as the in vitro studies mentioned in the introduction, suggest that MMR inactivation causes a low level resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy which does not play a significant role in intrinsic resistance. However, due to selection during chemotherapy MMR inactivation might play a greater role in the acquired resistance. We therefore propose that the role of MMR inactivation in acquired resistance in ovarian cancer should be further investigated.\n\n",

This mutation was detected in a very low fraction of the lymphocytes and was only detectable using the SSCP/HD analysis (Figure 2A). Owing to the subtle appearance of this mutation it could easily have been overlooked.\n\nThe phenotype of patient C107 does not fit the generally accepted genotype-phenotype correlation of AFAP, in which the disease-causing mutations are situated either in the 5' or 3' regions or the alternatively spliced part of exon 9 (see the introduction). A speculative reason for the attenuated phenotype could be that the patient is mosaic in the epithelial cells of the colon. The parents of patient C107 of age 73 and 80 years as well as her three children, age 31\u201340 years, were free of polyps. No CRC has been diagnosed on either the maternal or paternal side of the family. The mutation was not detected in blood samples from the patient's parents or from her three children. It is possible that either gonadal or somatic mosaicism exists in patient C107.\n\nAPC mutational mosaicism could be a reason for the quite large number of de novo or sporadic FAP cases that exist [23-25,40]. In the family of C107 the mutation has not been passed on to the offspring of the patient and, thus, this appears to be a sporadic case, but, generally, the existence of mosaicism is a risk of error in predictive diagnosis in FAP/AFAP families [43]. In the initial stages, the molecular screening procedure of FAP/AFAP patients uses mainly PCR-based methods for analysis of the APC gene in DNA from isolated blood samples. Therefore, the chances of detecting pathogenic low-frequency APC mutations that are present only in a small fraction of the peripheral blood cells or only in the colon are poor. Approximately 25% of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients have been shown to be cases of mosaicism [44]. When investigating NF2 mutational mosaicism, the search for constitutional mutations is preferably carried out initially in tumor cells. Detected mutations could subsequently be verified in blood leukocyte samples. However, this approach would not be applicable for FAP mosaisicm as somatic APC mutations are frequently found in tumors.\n\nSplice-site affecting mutations\n\nTwo novel germline APC mutations that introduce different cryptic splice sites are characterized in this study. Both mutations result in the aberrant splicing of APC exons 7 and 8 and prematurely truncated APC protein, and both are defined as pathogenic. The aberrant splicing identified in patient C496 (c.835-7T > G) is caused by an introduction of a new active splice site 6 bp upstream of the wildtype AG splice site of intron 7. This acceptor site is apparently preferred by the splicing machinery, as shown by the results of the cDNA sequencing (Figure 3). The c.834G > C substitution at the last nucleotide of exon 7 in patient C633, would theoretically introduce a missense mutation at codon 278. However, as demonstrated by the cDNA sequencing results (Figure 4) the mutation leads to the use of a cryptic splice donor site 11 bp upstream in exon 7. This real outcome of the mutation would easily have been overlooked unless the RNA-based methods had been used. Other examples of aberrant splicing of the APC gene due to missense mutations have recently been described [16]. One case of use of aberrant splice-acceptor site of APC exon 8 has been reported previously in a patient with classical polyposis [15]. However, an alternative acceptor splice site (c.845-17A > G) in intron 7 has been reported from a patient with a milder phenotype, multiple synchronous colorectal adenomas [45].\n\n",

There were 895 (87.6%) MSI- cancers and 127 (12.4%) MSI+ cancers. The MSI+ cancers were further classified as sporadic (N = 98 or 9.6% of all cancers) or HNPCC (N = 29 or 2.9% of all cancers) based on germline MLH1 or MSH2 mutations (Table 1).\n\nAges at cancer can be used to estimate likely numbers of oncogenic mutations required before transformation [3-6,11]. Average ages for sporadic MSI+, MSI-, and HNPCC cancers were respectively 71.5, 67.5, and 50.3 years (Figure 1A). For HNPCC cancers, estimated numbers of oncogenic mutations were between four and seven (95% credibility interval), with the most likely value of five mutations (Table 1). For MSI+ sporadic cancers, estimated numbers of mutations were between six and nine (95% credibility interval) with more likely values of seven or eight mutations. The most likely number of mutations was seven for sporadic MSI- cancers.\n\nDuke's stage and age at clinical presentation (Figure 1B) were documented for 884 of the 895 MSI- sporadic cancers (Table 1). Average ages were 68.6 years for stage A, 69.0 years for stage B, 65.2 years for stage C, and 65.4 years for stage D. The most likely numbers of oncogenic mutations were seven for stage A cancers, eight for stage B cancers, and six for stage C or D cancers (Table 1).\n\nMutation number estimates with respect to clinical stage may be biased with the Finnish data because it includes only specimens with tissue available for molecular analysis. Advanced cancers may not be removed. Therefore, a similar analysis was performed on a population-based cancer registry [10] from the United States of America (SEER 11 Regs Public-Use, Nov 2001 Sub (1992\u20131999)), which records ages and stages at diagnosis regardless of treatment (Table 2). The average age at diagnosis was 70.5 years, consistent with an estimate of six mutations to colorectal cancer for the 108,275 white males and females with stage data. Like the Finnish cancers, ages were similar for SEER patients of different clinical stages, with an estimate of six mutations for cancers with localized, regional or distant clinical stages (Table 2 and Figure 1C).\n\n",

This region has been reported in other studies to be frequently deleted in colon cancer (see Table 4). APC itself is not represented in this plot (no valid expression measures). It is located down-stream of TIGA1 and up-stream of DP1 and DCP2. Note the sharp change from expression up-regulation (TIGA1) to expression down-regulation (DCP2 to DMXL1) in this interval.\n\n14q24.3\n\nThe chromosomal region 14q24.3 has been implicated in colorectal cancer several times (see Table 1). We found coordinated down-regulation of expression of genes in 14q24.1-14q24.3 (see Figures 30, 31, 32). The region comprises the MLH3 gene that is linked to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer type 7 (HNPCC7). We note that also the FOS gene encoding one half of the bZIP dimer activator protein (AP-1) at 14q24.3 is strongly down-regulated. FOS is known as an oncogene and its down-regulation is therefore unexpected. However, deletions of 14q24.3 have been linked to metastatic CRC [36]. In combination, these results suggest that there is a class II tumor metastasis suppressor in this region. This class II TSG is probably not MLH3, as its protein function is hardly related to cellular functions promoting metastasis. The functions of several other strongly misregulated proteins, however, make them better candidates for metastasis suppressors. KIAA0317 codes for a predicted transmembrane ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitin ligases can help to tag misfolded transmembrane proteins in the ER for destruction via the proteasome system [37]. Absence of such a function could result in misexpressed proteins at the cell surface which could promote metastasis. Other potential candidates for metastasis suppressor genes in this region code for the transmembrane Alzheimer protein PSEN1, the GTPase activating protein KIAA0440/SIPA1L1, the PDZ-domain synaptojanin 2-binding protein SYNJ2BP and the developmental regulator and Notch interaction partner NUMB.\n\nDown-regulation of mRNA expression in human chromosomal region 14q24.1-14q24.3 \u2013 the FOS region (T/N relative expression heat map).

A detailed family and medical history was obtained through interview with the proband relatives and their consent for release of medical records and use of the pathological tissue blocks still available.\n\nThe early onset of the colon cancer in the proband and the study of the family's pedigree (fig. 1), that fulfill the strict Amsterdam-1 criteria, prompted genetic analysis with suspicion of HNPCC. They were informed about the risks, benefits and limitations of the study protocol.\n\nPedigree showing HNPCC family. An arrow indicates the male index patient (III:3) diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma at the age of 23 years. Family members suffering from a malignancy are indicated by a shaded circle or square. The age, type of malignancy, as well as the generation (roman figures), are described below the indicated patient. The family fulfill the Amsterdam-I criteria with presence of extracolonic tumors in the extended pedigree, having more than three carcinomas of colon (C) or ovary (O) in the affected members. The syndrome is present in all three generations (I-III) and three family members are younger than 50 years (III:3, II:1 and I:3). At the moment of the study the proband's mother (II-5) was an unaffected carrier, but two years later she developed an endometrial (E) adenocarcinoma.\n\nStudy protocol\n\nAs screening method for HNPCC we searched for MSI in the proband's primary tumor and metastasis tissue blocks. The absence of proband's non-tumor DNA for MSI testing was overcome studying the alleles carried by his progenitors. Once the MSI was established, a second blood sample was obtained from the proband's mother (obligate carrier but at the moment of the study still unaffected) to full mutation analysis of the hMSH2 and hMLH1 genes by direct sequencing. After identifying the family mutation, we searched it in both proband's sisters.\n\nDNA preparation for genetic testing\n\nPeripheral blood was collected from the three consulting family members and the proband's father. Genomic DNA isolation from their lymphocytes was performed using a standard phenol-chloroform extraction. DNA from the proband was obtained from the formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue blocks and isolated by microdissection of tumor, deparaffinization, proteinase K treatment, and ethanol precipitation [7].\n\nDetermination of MSI\n\nThe reference panel of 5 microsatellite markers standardized by the National Cancer Institute for the screening of HNPCC (BAT-25, BAT-26, D2S123, D5S346 and D17S250) were PCR amplified using the corresponding specific primers for each one [8]. All the PCR products were electrophoresed through a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining (fig. 2).\n\n",

                "text": "Discussion\n\nThe accelerated development of genetic counselling in cancer during the past few years is due to the feedback and interactive information sharing on genetic studies, clinical management and psychological issues in families with a high risk of cancer. Identification of deleterious variants in such families is essential for accurate assessment of individual risk and, if required, subsequent inclusion into a personalized surveillance programme.\n\nUnfortunately, genetic testing for hereditary cancer frequently fails to identify unambiguous deleterious variants. Erroneous classification of a genetic variant may have a great effect on at-risk familial who undergo genetic testing for risk prediction because it results in incorrect clinical recommendations.\n\nLS is the most common hereditary CRC-predisposing syndrome and accounts for 3% of unselected CRC cases. A significant proportion of DNA variations found in patients suspected of having LS are UVs (32%, 18% and 38% for MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6, respectively) [6]. The pathogenicity of the MLH1 p.Lys618Ala variant remains controversial because of conflicting data [InSiGHT, http://www.insight-group.org] (Figure 5).\n\nClassification of the MLH1 p.Lys618Ala variant according to the InSiGHT database (accessed on 07/2010).\n\nThe p.Lys618Ala substitution replaces a charged amino acid with a neutral one, and occurs alongside four charged amino acids that are well conserved in mammals. In silico predictions of the pathogenicity of this variant using the PolyPhen http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/ and SIFT http://sift.jcvi.org/ computational program were discordant; the SIFT analysis classified it as a tolerant variant and the PolyPhen analysis classed it as possibly damaging [9]. It has been shown that this variant may reduce the binding ability of MLH1 to PMS2 in HCT116 cells co-transfected with mutated MLH1 and wild-type PMS2 [10]. In contrast, it had no effect on the ability of MLH1 to bind PMS2 in a co-immunoprecipitation assay [9]. Functional analysis using the pCAS ex vivo splicing assay and RNA analysis also demonstrated no effect [11]. Moreover, a significant decrease in MLH1 protein stability has been found for the p.Lys618Ala variant [9].\n\nThe results of in silico prediction and functional assays alone are insufficient to determine whether this variant is deleterious or a rare functional polymorphism. For this purpose, it is necessary to integrate indirect evidence with direct genetic evidence involving clinical observations of disease occurrence.\n\nThe frequency of variants in unaffected controls is used often to distinguish between neutral and potentially deleterious variants. If the frequency of a variant among a few hundred controls is \u22651%, it is highly unlikely to be a high-risk variant. In such cases, it is still possible that the variant will be associated with a modest risk of the disease [3]. Case-control studies enable quantification of the disease risk associated with the variant. The main disadvantage of such analyses is that a large sample size is required to obtain sufficient power to detect the lower risk level. The sample size required is related inversely to the frequency of the variant in the population. The sample size used in the present study resulted in 80% power to detect an OR of 3.0 (two-sided test; alpha level, 5%). The frequency of the p.Lys618Ala variant in our control series was 2.7% and no significant differences were observed in the sporadic and familial groups, indicating that a high penetrance effect for colorectal carcinogenesis can be excluded. Similar results were reported in case-control studies on Scottish and Danish populations [12,13].\n\n",

The cancers represent approximately 60% of all colorectal cancers removed from this population in 1994 to 1998 [9]. Germline mutations in MLH1 or MSH2 were detected by allelic specific PCR assays (for the two common Finnish MLH1 germline mutations) or by direct genomic sequencing of coding exons [9]. The data can be downloaded from the following website: . Approval for this research was obtained from the appropriate ethics committees, which are in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.\n\nA second data set (SEER 11 Regs Public-Use, Nov 2001 Sub (1992\u20131999)) was obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, a population-based registry in the United States of America that records all cancers regardless of clinical treatment [10]. A total of 108,275 records were analyzed for ages at cancer selected by site (colon and rectum), race (white), histology (adenocarcinoma, ICD-0-2 codes 8000\u20138500), and stage (localized, regional, or distant). These cancers were not characterized with respect to HNPCC or MSI.\n\nQuantitative analysis\n\nNumbers of oncogenic alterations (genetic mutations or epigenetic alterations) required for transformation were estimated from ages at cancer using a Bayesian approach as previously described [11]. This method requires the use of a life table from census data: for the Finnish data set we used a Finnish life table from the World Health Organization website , for the SEER dataset we used a United States life table as described previously [11]. The model assumes the first visible clonal expansion occurs at the time of transformation and ignores the interval after transformation. The analysis ignores temporal trends, which may influence our mutation estimates.\n\nFor the SEER dataset, we also fit our model for cancer progression [11] with the inferential method described in reference 12. This method does not require a life table, but unlike our method it does require information on all the cancer cases for the population at risk. Therefore this method is appropriate for analysing the SEER dataset but not the Finnish dataset. Our method [11] is appropriate for analysing both datasets. For the SEER dataset, the two methods inferred the same number of mutations required for cancer.\n\n",

Sequencing of the corresponding cDNA fragment identified a change in the beginning of exon 8 (Figure 3). Genomic sequencing of exon 8 and the flanking intron sequences lead to the discovery of the c.835-7T > G mutation (Figure 3A). The base substitution introduces a new AG splice-acceptor site eight bases upstream of exon 8. Owing to the use of this new splice site the last six bases of intron 7 are included in the transcript, resulting in premature truncation (Figure 3B). The entire APC coding region of the patient was sequenced and no other pathogenic variants were detected. A search for deletion or duplication of one or more exon in the APC gene by MLPA was also carried out with negative result.\n\nCharacterization of the mutation in patient C496.

Shown below the sequence diagram is the interpretation of the sequence reflecting the two mRNA species present in the sample. The insertion of 6 bp owing to the introduction of a new splice site in the mutant allele is shown as a shaded area. Predicted amino-acid sequence of translation products are shown above and below the respective cDNA sequence.\n\nThe APC mutation in patient C633 was also detected by RNA-based PTT, followed by cDNA sequencing and genomic sequencing of APC exon 7 (Figure 4). The c.834G > C mutation changes the normal splice donor site of exon 7. This substitution reduces the score for usage of the wild-type splice donor site according to [37]. An alternative cryptic splice donor site 11 bp upstream in exon 7 is used in the mutant allele, leading to the aberrant splicing of exon 7. The resulting APC mRNA carries a frameshift, caused by the 11-bp deletion in the 3' end of exon 7, which leads to the premature truncation of the protein in exon 8. A third novel mutation affecting splicing of the APC gene was detected by PTT analysis and genomic sequencing of patient C232. A complex deletion/insertion was detected that affects the splicing of APC intron 3, APC c.423-6del8ins13 (in detail APC c. 423 -6delAAATAGGTinsGAAGCAAGATCAG).\n\n",

In view of the strong associations between BRAF mutation and specific pathological (site, grade, mucinous, infiltrating lymphocytes) and molecular (methylated MSI+, CIMP+, wildtype KRAS) features, it will be interesting in future studies to determine the predictive significance of this marker for response to adjuvant therapies in CRC.\n\n",

Three of these deletions have not, to the best of the authors' knowledge, been described earlier. The deletion encompassing APC exon 4 in patient 3765, c.423-1662_531+1825del3595, was detected by RNA-based PTT with subsequent cDNA sequencing and verified by long-range PCR on genomic DNA. We could not detect this deletion with MLPA even though a probe for exon 4 is included in the MLPA kit (see the discussion). Detection of the large deletion in patient C591, encompassing APC exons 13 through the 5' part of exon 15, was carried out with MLPA. The deletion in patient 2136 was identified by PTT and subsequent DNA sequencing.\n\nA case of APC mosaicism\n\nThree patients (C107, C257, and C505), negative for mutations in APC, were reported as de novo cases with no known family history of FAP. These patients where all screened for APC mutations present as low-frequency alleles using SSCP/HD. We did not detect any signs of low-frequency mutations in patients C257 and C505. However, in patient C107, aberrant bands, possibly originating from formation of heteroduplexes, was detected by SSCP/HD in a very low fraction of her blood lymphocytes. The c.2700_2701delTC mutation, which results in frame shift at codon 900, was found by sequencing of the aberrant bands excised from the SSCP/HD gel (Figure 2A). The mutation was detected in approximately one-third of the analyzed tumor-derived cells extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue by DNA sequencing (Figure 2B). The mutation was not detectable at all in the sequence determination of DNA extracted from blood lymphocytes from the patient (Figure 2C).\n\nDetection of the mosaic c.2700_2701delTC mutation in patient C107.

The mutation was also detectable by SSCP/HD analysis but was not detectable by PTT due to its localization close to the 5' end of the PTT fragment. However, indication for a mutation was observed as lowered intensity of the full-length fragment.\n\n",

After amplification, the PCR products were purified by electrophoresis through a 1.5% low melting point agarose gel, and then were sequenced on an AB13100-Avant sequencer (Applied Biosystem Shanghai Division) using fluorescently labeled primers, following the protocols supplied by the manufacturer. By comparing the obtained sequence with the known sequence, nonsense, missense, and frameshift mutations were identified. Nonsense and frameshift mutations were considered pathogenic. All missense mutations were screened in 50 patients with MSS colorectal cancer and 50 people without cancer or a family history of cancer. They were judged as pathogenic if they could not be found in MSS patients and normal people, otherwise, they were judged as polymorphisms.\n\n",

In HNPCC, histologically verified colorectal carcinoma is found in at least three relatives from two or more successive generations. In at least one patient, the age of onset should be less than 50 years. Seven chromosomal regions have been linked to HNPCC. More than half of these HNPCC regions show misregulated expression in our patients. Three regions show down-regulation (3p21.3, 2q31-q33 comprising PMS1, 14q24.3 comprising MLH3), one region shows up-regulation (7p22 comprising PMS2), and three regions do not show significant changes in expression (2p22.p21 comprising MSH2, 2p16 comprising MSH6, 3p22 comprising TGFBR2). Eleven further chromosomal regions are linked to hereditary colorectal carcinoma under a common entry in OMIM (14500). More than 50% of these regions show significant expression changes in our data. Five regions show down-regulation (1p35, 14q24.3, 17p11.2, 17p13.1, 22q13), one region shows up-regulation (2p25), and five regions do not show significant expression changes in our data (3q26.3, 8p22-p21.3, 11p11.2, 15q15, 17q24). In combination, these findings strongly suggest that expression changes in regions linked to hereditary CRC play a role in CRC development.\n\nCongruence of our study with the genome-wide copy number and expression analysis of Tsafrir et al\n\nA particular focus of our study was on the congruence of our data with that of Tsafrir et al. [17]. These authors described 11 alterations of whole chromosomes or chromosome arms. Using our approach based solely on expression data we found precisely defined region of coordinated up-regulation in all four regions of gene expression and gDNA copy number gain that they reported (+7, +8q, +13q, +20q). For six of seven aberrations (-1p, -4, -5q, -14q, -15q, -18) we discovered smaller expression islands of coordinated down-regulation. We were not able to reproduce the finding of expression loss on 8p. In summary, this large congruence of our results with that of Tsafrir et al. can be regarded as an external validation of our results. The comparison illustrates the power of our data analysis approach which allows to define expression islands on a single-gene resolution. Most importantly it confirms our confidence in the use of the chip platform (Affymetrix U133A) that was used in both studies and apparently can lead to largely congruent results in different patient cohorts and laboratories.\n\n",

All other cell lines showed no aberrations. In addition, the 75 ovarian carcinoma tissues and the four normal stromal controls showed no aberrations for BAT25, BAT26 and BAT40 or D2S123, indicating that these are microsatellite stable (MSS).\n\nMLH1 promoter methylation\n\nOne of the two A2780 sublines showed complete methylation of the MLH1 promoter while the other showed a low level of methylation. The results for HOC7 and 2774 were not informative and the other five cell lines showed no methylation. A low level of MLH1 promoter methylation was also seen in six ovarian carcinoma specimens and in addition, one ovarian carcinoma specimen showed abundant methylation. Five ovarian carcinomas were not informative while the other 63 ovarian carcinomas showed no methylation.\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR: expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6 and PMS2\n\nThe mRNA expression data for the cell lines is shown in Figure 3A. One of the two separately cultured MSI positive A2780 cell lines showed complete methylation of the MLH1 promoter and had no mRNA expression of MLH1. The other A2780 showed a low level of methylation but had the highest MLH1 expression levels compared to the other cell lines. Of the other two MSI positive cell lines, SKOV3 also showed no MLH1 expression while 2774 did express MLH1 mRNA.\n\nRNA was available for 50 of the 75 ovarian carcinomas and the mRNA expression data for these carcinomas is shown in Figure 3B. Interestingly, the ovarian carcinoma with an abundant MLH1 promoter methylation had a low MLH1 mRNA expression compared to the other carcinomas. Thirty-six of the 50 patients received platinum-based chemotherapy (7 non-responders, 28 responders and one patient with unknown response). There was no significant association between the response to platinum-based chemotherapy and the expression of each of these genes separately (Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.6). Since inactivation of only one of these genes might be sufficient to cause MMR deficiency, we used the expression of all of the five genes to mark MMR as active or inactive. If at least one of the five genes had an expression in the lowest quartile we marked MMR as inactive. If none of the genes had an expression in the lowest quartile MMR was marked as active (Figure 3B). Next the Mann-Whitney test demonstrated that there was no significant relation between the deducted MMR status and response to platinum-based chemotherapy (p = 0.665).\n\n",

There was no correlation between loss of expression of MGMT and either KRAS or BRAF mutation across the full range of polyp types. However, among TAs <\u200a10 mm, KRAS mutation occurred in 3/25 (12%) adenomas with no MGMT loss but in 4/8 (50%) adenomas with MGMT loss (P < 0.04). Since there were few KRAS mutations in this subset and most KRAS mutations (5/7) were G\u2192A, it was not possible to demonstrate an association between MGMT loss and G\u2192A mutation in KRAS.\n\nAberrant expression of p53 and correlation with MGMT loss\n\nSixty-two TAs, 22 TVAs/VAs, 15 SAs and 10 MPs were immunostained for p53. Weak expression of nuclear p53 occurred frequently within the proliferative compartment in all types of polyps and was ignored. Aberrant p53 expression was observed in only four polyps: one TA, one MP (Figure 1B) and two SAs (Figure 2). Overall, only 1/84 (1%) conventional adenomas showed aberrant expression of p53 compared with 3/25 (12%) serrated polyps with dysplasia (P < 0.04). In the latter, aberrant p53 expression coincided with high-grade dysplasia and reduced or complete loss of expression of MGMT (Figures 1B and 2).

The human ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV6, HOC7, SKOV3, 2774, KB3.1 and CAOV3 were cultured in DMEM/HAMF12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, A2780 in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and OVCAR3 in RPMI 1640 with 20% fetal calf serum and 0.01 mg/ml insulin. The human colon cancer cell lines SW480 and SW48, included as controls, were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal calf serum and DMEM/HAMF12 with 10% fetal calf serum respectively. The ovarian cancer cell line A2780 has been cultured separately in two different research laboratories at our department. The isolated DNA and RNA from each culture were used for further analysis.\n\nThe MTT colorimetric assay, which measures the number of viable cells capable of reducing the tetrazolium compound (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) to a blue formazan product, was used to quantitate the chemosensitivity of the ovarian cancer cell lines to cisplatin. The assay was performed as described previously by us [38].\n\nPatients\n\nThe study design was approved by the medical ethical committee of the Erasmus MC Rotterdam, the Netherlands (MEC 02.949). Tissue of 75 ovarian cancer patients and four normal stromal ovarian tissues collected at the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam were included in this study. The patient and tumor characteristics are listed in Table 1. Forty-six patients received platinum-based chemotherapy of whom 34 responded to treatment defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease or no relapse within 6 months after chemotherapy, whereas eleven patients had progressive disease or a relapse within 6 months after chemotherapy. In one patient the response was not known. The response rate of 74% (34/46) is comparable with the response rate of 80% seen in the clinic. A more detailed description of the response definitions has been previously described by us [5]. The median age at the time of surgery was 52 years (range 27\u201383).\n\nDNA isolation: microsatellite analysis and methylation specific PCR\n\nMicrosatellite analysis and methylation specific PCR (MSP) were performed on DNA from eight ovarian cancer cell lines, 75 ovarian cancer specimens (part of a collection of ovarian tumor specimens described by us previously [39]) and the four normal stromal ovarian specimens (see study design in Figure 2).\n\n",

With simple multistage models [3-6,11], all cancers of a given type require the same number of oncogenic mutations, but stochastic differences in the times to accumulate these mutations allow individual cancers to appear at different ages. Precisely when and how quickly mutations accumulate are unknown, but a basic premise is that cancer types requiring more mutations will tend to appear later in life. Therefore, numbers of mutations may be estimated from cancer epidemiology. Colorectal cancer frequencies increase with age, and the pattern of this increase is consistent with approximately five to seven oncogenic mutations [3-6].\n\nIn this study numbers of mutations were estimated for well-defined subgroups of colorectal cancers because biological heterogeneity may confound this type of quantitative analysis. Such estimates should be considered rough guides rather than absolute values because our model does not account for all factors. Cancers were classified as MSI+ or MSI-, and MSI+ cancers were further sub-classified as either hereditary (HNPCC) or sporadic. As expected because one MMR mutation is inherited, estimated numbers of critical mutations were less for MSI+ HNPCC cancers compared to sporadic MSI+ cancers. However, sporadic MSI+ cancers required more than one additional somatic mutation compared to HNPCC cancers. Of interest, a difference of more than a single mutation has also been inferred between sporadic and FAP cancers, with estimates of three to four mutations for FAP cancers versus six for sporadic cancers [6,13], although another analysis was consistent with a difference of only a single mutation [14]. Therefore, germline mutations (APC and MMR loci) in both common colorectal familial cancer syndromes (FAP and HNPCC) appear to advance progression by more than a single mutation relative to their sporadic counterparts.\n\nAn epigenetic mechanism may help explain why sporadic MSI+ cancers require more than one additional somatic alteration relative to HNPCC cancers. Inactivation of the normal MMR allele occurs through mutation (usually LOH [15]) in HNPCC whereas MMR loss in sporadic MSI+ cancers is associated with MLH1 promoter methylation [16,17]. CpG islands may be \"protected\" from methylation because most are unmethylated at birth and usually remain unmethylated throughout life [18]. Epigenetic MLH1 inactivation may require at least two cis acting somatic alterations---loss of a mechanism that normally prevents methylation, followed by the accumulation of methylation at sufficient numbers of CpG sites to silence expression.\n\nIn agreement with prior studies, there were seven mutations estimated for sporadic MSI- Finnish cancers [4], and seven or eight mutations for MSI+ cancers. A requirement for more alterations before tranformation for sporadic MSI+ compared to sporadic MSI- cancers may help explain why sporadic MSI+ cancers are a minority of all colorectal cancers and occur in slightly older patients [19,20]. Although numbers of oncogenic mutations before transformation are similar between sporadic MSI+ and MSI- cancers, their identities likely differ [7,8].\n\n",

Purely unsupervised hierarchical clustering of tissue samples based on gene expression vectors can provide such information. The use of the full set of 44 k genes for clustering is not desirable, because of high signal-noise ratios and computational considerations. Therefore, we pre-selected potentially informative genes for hierarchical clustering. We selected only genes which had reliable information about genomic localization and for which probe sets exceeded a minimum expression threshold in at least 20% of the experiments. To enrich informative genes for tissue distinction, we required a minimum standard deviation across all 50 samples. The pre-selection resulted in 514 probe sets. Note that we avoided to pre-select genes based on differential expression between tumor and normal tissue. We applied three rounds of normalization to genes and arrays. Finally, we applied standard centroid hierarchical clustering (Pearson correlation) to this dataset. Two large clusters were revealed (Figure 1). 18 out of 25 normal tissues formed one single cluster. The remaining 8 normal tissues mainly clustered together with matching tumor samples from same patients. This suggests that coalescence between tumor and normal samples from the same patients could be due to patient-specific gene expression characteristics. As the majority of normal samples could be clearly separated from tumors, we concluded that our data set is well suited to explore differences in gene expression between normal and tumor cells of colorectal origin.\n\nHierarchical clustering of samples from colorectal tumors and normal colon epithelia. On the right, you find the chromosomal localization of the genes and the official HUGO symbol or prospective Affymetrix cluster ID. On the top, the binary tree of tissue samples based on gene expression is given. The tissue denominators either contain TR for tumor or E for epithelium and a code reflecting the identity of each patient. In the center, the expression values after normalization have been color-coded: light blue means high expression, black means low (or no) expression. Note that only a representative fraction of the 514 genes is visualized here (white bars replace some portions of original heat map). The right cluster contains only samples from normal colon epithelia, the left cluster is composed primarily of tumors along with some interspersed normal epithelial samples. Note that misplaced normal tissue (E) samples often cluster along with matching tumor (TR) samples from the same patient.\n\n",

Note the expression down-regulation of SLIT2, GPR125 and PCDH7.\n\n18q21.2-18q23\n\nThere are several reports of loss of chromosome 18q in CRC (see Tables 1 and 4). We found a smaller region of expression down-regulation at 18q21.2-18q23 (see Figures 24, 25, 26). There is a hot spot for down-regulation in direct vicinity of the BCL2 gene. Its special role in cancer qualified the anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein as a therapeutic target molecule [34,35]. Here we observed down-regulation of BCL2 and its neighbors which is contradictory to its known anti-apoptotic cancer-promoting function. Distal to BCL2 at 18q21.1-18q21.2 there is a region of less pronounced down-regulation between ME2 and MBD2. The SMAD4 (Hs.298320) is only weakly down-regulated and the biological significance is questionable. The DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma), proximal to MBD2, is the largest gene in this region, but no statements about its expression can be made because of a lack of informative expression measures. The SMAD2 and SMAD7 genes are in close vicinity to this region. In summary, we do not have direct evidence for down-regulation of tumor suppressor genes in this region. Instead, we observed down-regulation of the cancer-promoting BCL2 gene. Therefore, the biological significance of this domain of expression loss remains elusive. Possibly, the down-regulation of the BCL2 region is just a by-stander effect of deletions targeted at DCC disruption. Alternatively, BCL2 down-regulation could be an unsuccessful attempt of the tumor cells' genetic program to shift the cellular homeostasis towards cell death.\n\n",

Table 1 describes the tumour and patient characteristics of seven colorectal tumours that harboured a mutation in CTNNB1 exon 3. In five colorectal cancers, a CTNNB1 mutation that would lead to loss of one of the Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites and subsequent stabilisation of the protein, occurred at codons 37 and 45, all were C\u2192T transitions, leading to Ser\u2192Phe amino acid changes and occurred in the proximal colon. All bar one also had an activating mutation in the K-ras gene. Three of these five tumours showed hMLH1 deficiency. Two colorectal cancer patients harboured a mutation in the CTNNB1 gene, that did not occur at the Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites, but would result in an amino acid alteration at codons 22 and 29, the effects of which are unknown. Because of the very low frequency of tumours harbouring a CTNNB1 mutation, these mutations were not included in further analyses. In addition, mutation analysis of remaining samples was abandoned, since this was deemed irrelevant as these harboured truncating APC mutations and are considered to be unlikely to also have CTNNB1 mutations [7].\n\nOf 656 tumours for which the other molecular alterations, i.e. mutations in the APC and K-ras genes and hMLH1 expression, were all successfully and completely analysed, 103 colorectal tumours did not harbour a truncating or missense APC mutation, an activating K-ras mutation or showed lack of hMLH1 expression, as depicted in figure 1. Truncating as well as missense APC mutations and activating K-ras mutations were relatively common. Truncating APC mutations alone and activating K-ras mutations in codons 12 and 13 only, occurred at similar frequencies (20% (130/656) and 18% (121/656), respectively). A combination of a truncating mutation in APC and an activating mutation in K-ras occurred less often than the sole occurrences of mutations in both genes. However, as shown in table 2, the simultaneous occurrence of mutations in both genes occurred more frequently than expected on the basis of chance alone. A \u03c72 test for the occurrence of a truncating APC mutation and an activating K-ras mutation revealed that the occurrence of these mutations was not independent (\u03c72 = 8.7, P < 0.001), but the correlation was weak (Cram\u00e9rs V = 0.138). Finally, although 11 tumours that harboured a mutation in the APC or K-ras gene also lacked hMLH1 expression, hMLH1 deficiency occurred more frequently in tumours that did not harbour these mutations (\u03c72 = 36.6, P < 0.001).\n\n",

Modeling is potentially more informative and specific when applied to distinct cancer subtypes because their progression pathways can differ.

Activating mutations in BRAF have been reported in 5\u201315% of colorectal carcinomas (CRC), with by far the most common mutation being a 1796T to A transversion leading to a V600E substitution [1-3]. The BRAF V600E hotspot mutation is strongly associated with the microsatellite instability (MSI+) phenotype but is mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations [4-7]. Interestingly, BRAF mutations are found only in MSI+ sporadic tumors that result from aberrant MLH1 promoter methylation and do not occur in MSI+ tumors from hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) patients [5,8-10], thus providing a convenient discriminator between sporadic and familial cases. The majority of MSI+ sporadic tumors belong to a larger CRC group referred to as the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP+) that is characterised by widespread hypermethylation of CpG islands located with gene promoter regions [11]. Both MSI+ and CIMP+ tumors are thought to arise from large hyperplastic polyps and serrated adenomas [12,13] and recent work has demonstrated a high frequency of BRAF mutations in these lesions [7,14,15].\n\nAlthough the positive association with MSI+ and inverse association with KRAS mutation have been well documented, little is known about the other properties of tumors with BRAF mutation. In the present study we analysed for BRAF V600E mutations in a consecutive series of 275 CRCs that were well characterised for the major pathological and molecular features of this disease. Our results demonstrate that oncogenic BRAF mutation occurs preferentially within a subgroup of CRCs that have distinctive features. It could therefore be used as a convenient marker for the further characterisation of these tumors, particularly in relation to their prognosis and response to adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n",

In this study, SSAs accounted for approximately 3% of the overall series of polyps and were more age-related than HPs. Importantly, SSAs have been linked with the subset of colorectal cancer with BRAF mutation, DNA methylation, MSI and serrated architecture.14,18,37 In this study there was a high frequency of BRAF mutation in conventional HPs (67%) as well as in SSAs (81%). Previous reports have shown very similar results for BRAF mutation in SSA,16 but higher frequencies of KRAS mutation and lower frequencies of BRAF mutation in HPs.12,16,38 As mentioned in Materials and methods, there had been selection of larger HPs in an earlier cell kinetic study involving the same material. Large HPs are more likely to include the subset described as \u2018microvesicular\u2019, in which the columnar cells contain apical mucin droplets within small vesicles while goblet cells are rendered inconspicuous.25BRAF mutation occurs more frequently in the microvesicular variant of HP.16 By contrast, KRAS mutation occurs much more commonly in the goblet cell variant of HP, which is usually small, located in the left colon or rectum and deviates minimally from normal colorectal mucosa in terms of differentiation and architecture.16,25 The latter were under-represented in this series (details not shown).\n\ndysplastic serrated polyps: MP and SA\n\nSerrated polyps with dysplasia, i.e. MPs and SAs, together comprised only 2% of the overall consecutive series of 1250 polyps. While mutation of KRAS and BRAF was associated with conventional adenoma and SSA, respectively (see above), BRAF and KRAS mutation occurred with similar frequency in both MPs (40% and 50%, respectively) and SAs (33% and 27%, respectively). In the literature, the frequency of BRAF and KRAS mutation in MP or SA has ranged from 36 to 100% and from 0% to 60%, respectively.12,16,39\u201342 These findings indicate that this subset of colorectal polyps is likely to be heterogeneous in terms of its molecular origins. These polyps were therefore reclassified according to their resemblance to HP or SSA (Group A) (Figure 1A,B,E,F) or to conventional adenoma (Group B) (Figure 1C,D). Particular histological features among the Group A polyps were: marked serration, a papillary or villous architecture, a relatively abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, columnar cells with apical mucin droplets, nuclei that were enlarged, ovoid, vesicular and contained a prominent nucleolus, and adjacent non-dysplastic serrated polyp. Particular histological features among the Group B polyps were: some glandular serration, frequent villous change and epithelial dysplasia that appeared adenomatous (cytoplasmic basophilia and nuclei that were elongated, pseudostratified and hyperchromatic without a prominent nucleolus). Importantly, BRAF mutation occurred more frequently among Group A polyps (P < 0.03), whereas there was a trend for KRAS to be more frequent among Group B polyps (P = 0.06).\n\n",

Finding the causative mutations has great implications for the families. Correlating the genotypes to the phenotypes could help to improve the diagnosis and follow-up of patients.\n\nMethods\n\nMutation screening of APC and the clinical characterization of 96 unrelated FAP patients from the Swedish Polyposis Registry was performed. In addition to generally used mutation screening methods, analyses of splicing-affecting mutations and investigations of the presence of low-frequency mutation alleles, indicating mosaics, have been performed, as well as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect lowered expression of APC.\n\nResults\n\nSixty-one different APC mutations in 81 of the 96 families were identified and 27 of those are novel. We have previously shown that 6 of the 96 patients carried biallelic MUTYH mutations. The 9 mutation-negative cases all display an attenuated or atypical phenotype. Probands with a genotype (codon 1250\u20131464) predicting a severe phenotype had a median age at diagnosis of 21.8 (range, 11\u201349) years compared with 34.4 (range, 14\u201357) years among those with mutations outside this region (P < 0.017). Dense polyposis (> 1000) occurred in 75% of the probands with a severe phenotype compared with 30% in those with mutations outside this region. The morbidity in colorectal cancer among probands was 25% at a mean age of 37.5 years and 29% at a mean age of 46.6 years.\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing a variety of mutation-detection techniques, we have achieved a 100% detection frequency in classical FAP. Probands with APC mutations outside codon 1250\u20131464, although exhibiting a less-severe phenotype, are at high risk of having a colorectal cancer at diagnosis indicating that age at diagnosis is as important as the severity of the disease for colorectal cancer morbidity.\n\n",

Group A polyps are likely to be initiated by BRAF mutation and are serrated lesions at the outset. Group B polyps may begin as conventional adenomas and then become serrated and villous following mutation of KRAS. There may be instances in which KRAS mutation can initiate lesions which are serrated at the outset and become dysplastic. While this suggestion remains speculative, it may apply to the Group A serrated polyps that show a distinct likeness to the goblet cell variant of HP in which columnar cells are eosinophilic and lack mucin-filled microvesicles and KRAS mutation is frequent (Figure 1E,F).16,25 The literature refers to the concept of \u2018traditional\u2019 SA.43 Based on the current findings, it is likely that several mechanisms can account for adenomatous lesions with glandular serration and that \u2018traditional\u2019 SA is not a single entity.\n\nConcept of \u2018fusion\u2019 pathways to crc\n\nColorectal polyps have traditionally been classified into distinct histogenetic types that may progress to CRC through independent pathways of colorectal tumorigenesis (Table 2). However, in addition to the two \u2018classical\u2019 pathways to CRC shown in Table 2, there may be \u2018fusion\u2019 pathways that combine mechanisms associated with both adenomas and serrated polyps. This would explain why many CRCs display phenotypes associated with serrated polyps as well as adenomas.44 Three possible examples of such fusion pathways are shown in Table 3. It is difficult to observe directly the actual point of transition from benign to malignant colorectal lesions. Once the key rate-limiting step is achieved it is likely that the transition to cancer occurs rapidly and the precursor lesion is then overtaken by the malignancy. Changes leading to inactivation of either TP535 or the DNA mismatch repair gene MLH113 are likely to be two such rate-limiting mechanisms. Only a single instance of loss of expression of MLH1 was observed in the present series of polyps and the adenoma in question was inferred to be from a patient with Lynch syndrome.24\n\nConcept of discrete colorectal lesions and progression to colorectal cancer via independent pathways\n\nACF, Aberrant crypt foci (hyperplastic or dysplastic); HP, hyperplastic polyp; SSA, sessile serrated adenoma; SA, serrated adenoma; TA, tubular adenoma.\n\nInactivation of MLH1 and TP53 is associated with malignant progression.\n\n\u2018Fusion\u2019 pathways brought about by the sequential alteration of genes (linked to separate lesions and pathways in Table 2) and with the second alteration associated with a superimposed morphology\n\n",

This proposal subsequently received strong support through the demonstration of molecular alterations common to both types of serrated polyp, notably mutation of BRAF and extensive DNA methylation.12 This viewpoint was consolidated through the formal recognition of two largely independent pathways of colorectal tumorigenesis: (i) the traditional adenoma\u2013carcinoma sequence associated with chomosomally unstable CRCs,13 and (ii) the \u2018serrated pathway\u2019 culminating in CRCs with DNA microsatellite instability (MSI), mutation of BRAF and extensive DNA methylation.12,14\u201320\n\nThis paper explores the possibility that the early evolution of colorectal cancer is not limited to two essentially independent pathways, but often combines components of these pathways. Indeed, the successful \u2018fusion\u2019 of the hyperproliferation and crypt fission that characterize adenomas21 with the inhibition of apoptosis that has been linked with serrated polyps22,23 may generate lesions with enhanced aggressiveness. Specifically, it is suggested that methylation of the DNA repair gene O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), mutation of KRAS and inactivation of TP53 provide critical combinations of molecular \u2018cross-over\u2019 between the two pathways that occur at the stage of precancerous polyps.\n\n",

                "text": "As most disease pedigrees are small, it is difficult to obtain a sufficient number of samples from affected and informative unaffected individuals. Moreover, LS deleterious variants are not completely penetrant. For these reasons, it is rarely possible to categorize variants as deleterious based on segregation alone. The co-occurrence of another known deleterious variant reduces the likelihood that an UV is truly deleterious, especially when both variants are located in trans [3]. To our knowledge, co-occurrence of a deleterious variant in one of the LS genes with the p.Lys618Ala variant has been observed in only two families. Liu et al [14] described an index subject from a LS family with two heterozygous variants (c.546-2A>G and c.1852_1853AA>GC); only the former segregated with LS in the family. Similarly, Steinke et al [15], described the co-occurrence of the p.Lys618Ala (c.1852_1853AA>GC) variant with the MSH6 p.Arg1068X (c.3202C>T) deleterious variant.\n\nHerein, we describe the coexistence of the p.Lys618Ala variant with deleterious variants in another two unrelated LS families. In one family, the allele distribution of the pathogenic and unclassified variant was in trans, in the other family the pathogenic variant was detected in the MSH6 gene and only the deleterious variant co-segregated with the disease in both families. This evidence indicates that the p.Lys618Ala variant is not deleterious.\n\nThe molecular hallmark of LS tumours is an MSI phenotype, a functional consequence of MMR deficiency. It is expected that the putative germ-line mutation responsible for LS would confer the MSI phenotype. We tested the MSI status of 17 tumours from p.Lys618Ala carriers and detected only two cases of MSI (11.8%). Taking into consideration the bias caused by the over-representation of Bethesda Criteria-positive tumours in this subset of cases (8/17), the MSI frequency was not significantly different from that in the unselected CRC group [7]. This is further proof that the presence of this variant is irrelevant to the functional inactivation of MLH1 in CRC patients.\n\nNonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that this variant may result in a small increase in susceptibility to CRC or adenomas, as was suggested by Fearnhead et al [16]. Further studies with appropriate sample sizes are required to address the low penetrance effect of this variant in CRC.\n\nFinally, we hypothesize that the clinical significance of a genetic variant may differ according to genetic background. Gene functionality may be the net result of the effects of allelic structures and their interactions with environmental factors. It is possible that low-penetrance variants behave differently in different populations, making it difficult to make predictions in terms of conferred risk.\n\n",
