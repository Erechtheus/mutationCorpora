                "text": "Mutation analysis of p53, K-ras, and BRAF genes in colorectal cancer progression.\n\nGene mutations in APC, K-ras, and p53 are thought to be essential events for colorectal cancer development. Recent data seem to indicate that K-ras and p53 mutations rarely co-exist in the same tumor, indicating that these alterations do not represent a synergistic evolutionary pathway. Moreover, an inverse relation between K-ras gene activation and BRAF mutations has been demonstrated, suggesting alternative pathways for colorectal cancer transformation. To reconstruct the chronological modulation of these gene mutations during cell transformation and colorectal cancer progression, mutations of p53, K-ras, and BRAF genes were analyzed by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) or sequencing analysis in 100 colorectal cancer samples, evenly distributed among different Dukes' stages. We found mutations in p53, K-ras, and BRAF genes in 35%, 30%, and 4% of tumors, respectively, and observed a minimal or no co-presence of these gene alterations. Moreover, the frequency of molecular p53 mutations increased as tumor stage increased, suggesting an important role for this gene in the progression of colorectal cancer. Conversely, K-ras or BRAF genes were not related to tumor stage or location. These data seem to indicate the absence of a co-presence of the genes, highlighting the possibility of multiple pathways for colorectal tumor progression. Moreover, mutations in p53, K-ras, and BRAF are not present in about one-third of colorectal cancers and therefore other gene mutations need to be investigated to better understand molecular mechanisms at the basis of cell transformation and the progression of colorectal cancer.\n",

To overcome weak expression, which is much lower than the widely used cytomegalovirus-promoter (CMV), new adenoviral vectors containing a binary system of transgene amplification have been developed. The Muc-1/DF3 promoter was used to control the expression of a Gal4VP16 fusion protein. This vector also contained Gal4 binding sites enabling the fusion protein to act as a transactivator, inducing transgene expression within the same construct. Mucin-1 expression was analyzed in a variety of colon cancer cell lines. After infection with recombinant adenoviruses, transgene expression was quantified using the luciferase system. Integration of the Gal4VP16-binary resulted in an up to 250-fold increase of Muc-1/DF3-specific gene expression. In mucin-positive cell lines utilizing this amplified Muc-1/DF3 promoter, expression was up to 590-fold higher as compared to the CMV-promoter. Western blot detected the presence of Gal4VP16 in infected muc-1-positive but not-negative cell lines. These new adenoviral vectors combing highly efficient and specific transgene expression and will contribute to the safety and efficacy of experimental approaches in cancer gene therapy.\n",

In only 10 of the 176 persons were both presumed markers of colorectal genetic predisposition present in the same individual. No evidence was found that these traits are causally associated. A combination of the two presumed markers showed a tendency towards occurrence in individuals with a positive family history of colorectal cancer among first-degree relatives.\n",

                "text": "Summary of microsatellite instability test results from laboratories participating in proficiency surveys: proficiency survey results from 2005 to 2012.\n\n\n## CONTEXT\nThe College of American Pathologists surveys are the largest laboratory peer comparison programs in the world. These programs allow laboratories to regularly evaluate their performance and improve the accuracy of the patient test results they provide. Proficiency testing is offered twice a year to laboratories performing microsatellite instability testing. These surveys are designed to emulate clinical practice, and some surveys have more challenging cases to encourage the refinement of laboratory practices.\n\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis report summarizes the results and trends in microsatellite instability proficiency testing from participating laboratories from the inception of the program in 2005 through 2012.\n\n## DESIGN\nWe compiled and analyzed data for 16 surveys of microsatellite instability proficiency testing during 2005 to 2012.\n\n## RESULTS\nThe number of laboratories participating in the microsatellite instability survey has more than doubled from 42 to 104 during the 8 years analyzed. An average of 95.4% of the laboratories correctly classified each of the survey test samples from the 2005A through 2012B proficiency challenges. In the 2011B survey, a lower percentage of laboratories (78.4%) correctly classified the specimen, possibly because of overlooking subtle changes of microsatellite instability and/or failing to enrich the tumor content of the specimen to meet the limit of detection of their assay.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn general, laboratories performed well in microsatellite instability testing. This testing will continue to be important in screening patients with colorectal and other cancers for Lynch syndrome and guiding the management of patients with sporadic colorectal cancer.\n",

                "text": "Fatty acid synthase overexpression in colorectal cancer is associated with microsatellite instability, independent of CpG island methylator phenotype.\n\nOverexpression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme for de novo lipogenesis, is observed in many cancers including colorectal cancer and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Cellular FASN expression is physiologically upregulated in a state of energy excess. Obesity and excess energy balance have been known to be risk factors for colorectal cancer. High degree of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is a distinct phenotype in colorectal cancer, associated with CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Previous data suggest that obesity or altered energy balance may potentially modify risks for MSI-H cancers and microsatellite stable (MSS) cancers differently. However, the relationship between MSI and FASN overexpression has not been investigated. Using 976 cases of population-based colorectal cancer samples from 2 large prospective cohort studies, we correlated FASN expression (by immunohistochemistry) with MSI, KRAS and BRAF mutations, p53 expression (by immunohistochemistry), and CIMP status [determined by MethyLight for 8 CIMP-specific gene promoters including CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1]. Marked (2+) FASN overexpression was observed in 110 (11%) of the 976 tumors and was significantly more common in MSI-H tumors (21% [28/135]) than MSI-low (5.6% [4/72], P = .004) and MSS tumors (11% [72/678], P = .001). The association between FASN overexpression and MSI-H persisted even after stratification by CIMP status. In contrast, FASN overexpression was not correlated with CIMP after stratification by MSI status. Fatty acid synthase overexpression was not significantly correlated with sex, tumor location, p53, or KRAS/BRAF status. In conclusion, FASN overexpression in colorectal cancer is associated with MSI-H, independent of CIMP status.\n",

The optimal management of the elevated risk for cancer in carriers of mutations for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is unclear.\n\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy benefits derived from endoscopic surveillance and prophylactic colectomy for persons who carry a mutation associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.\n\n## DESIGN\nDecision analysis model. Lifetime risk for colorectal cancer, efficacy of surveillance and colectomy, stage-specific colorectal cancer mortality, and quality of life were included in the model.\n\n## SETTING\nDecision about a cancer prevention strategy at the time of a positive result on genetic testing.\n\n## PATIENTS\nCarriers of a mutation for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer who were 25 years of age.\n\n## INTERVENTIONS\nImmediate prophylactic colectomy; delayed colectomy on the basis of age, adenoma, or diagnosis of colorectal cancer; and endoscopic surveillance. Prophylactic surgical options were proctocolectomy with ileoanal anastomosis and subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis.\n\n## MEASUREMENTS\nLife expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy.\n\n## RESULTS\nAll risk-reduction strategies led to large gains in life expectancy for carriers of a mutation for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, with benefits ranging from 13.5 years for surveillance to 15.6 years for prophylactic proctocolectomy at 25 years of age compared with no intervention. The benefits of colectomy compared with surveillance decreased with increasing age and were minimal if colectomy was performed at the time of colorectal cancer diagnosis. When health-related quality of life was considered, surveillance led to the greatest quality-adjusted life expectancy benefit (3.1 years compared with proctocolectomy and 0.3 years compared with subtotal colectomy).\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nColonoscopic surveillance is an effective method of reducing risk for cancer in carriers of a mutation for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The individual patient's choice between prophylactic surgery and surveillance is a complex decision in which personal preferences weigh heavily.\n",

In patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, carcinoma of the colorectum frequently develops and occasionally polyps develop in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Chromosomal deletion often is found for chromosomes 5, 17, and 18, on which tumor suppressor genes are located. Furthermore, loss of the alleles of loci on chromosome 3 has been reported in renal cell carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, and mixed salivary gland tumor in hereditary and sporadic cases. These data support the concept of a recessive mechanism for the development of human tumors.\n\n## PATIENTS AND RESULTS\nThe authors report the case of a 48-year-old woman with rectal cancer accompanied by multiple polyps in the esophagus, stomach, and colorectum. Histologically, the polypoid lesions in the esophagus, stomach, and colorectum showed a thickened mucosa, hyperplastic polyps, and mixed hyperplastic adenomatous polyps, respectively. Karyotype analysis showed 46, xx, inv(3)(p12.2q25.3) in all 20 inspected peripheral lymphocytes. By Southern blot with a c-raf probe, one allele of the c-raf-1 gene, which has been mapped on chromosome 3p25, was deleted from the rearranged chromosome 3 in the peripheral lymphocytes, intact colonic mucosa, and cancer tissue.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggest that the development of hyperplastic polyps and carcinoma of the rectum results from the allelic loss in chromosome 3p, as has been reported for solid tumors at other sites.\n",

In this study, we investigated a molecular mechanism underlying Bim-mediated apoptosis of p53-deficient tumor cells following actin damage. We found that actin inhibitors increased the protein levels of p53 and p21 and thereby inactivated both Cdk2 and Cdc2 kinases. However, p53- or p21-knockout cells fail to induce p21 and hence kept both Cdk2 and Cdc2 kinases active even after treatment with actin inhibitor. The p53- or p21-knockout cells became multinucleate and polyploidy in association with induction of apoptosis. Expression of Bcl-x(L) resulted in accumulation of polyploid cells in association with inhibition of apoptosis. However, expression of a dominant negative mutant (Cdk2dn) and treatment with chemical inhibitors for Cdk2 suppressed not only accumulation of multinucleated cells, but also induction of Bim expression and apoptosis. Therefore, these results suggest that Bim-mediated apoptosis following actin damage due to deregulation of Cdk2 and the cell cycle by the absence of functional p53.\n",

                "text": "Loss of expression of the DCC gene during progression of colorectal carcinomas in familial adenomatous polyposis and non-familial adenomatous polyposis patients.\n\nWe have previously observed that the frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 18q was low in adenomas and intramucosal carcinomas, whereas invasive carcinomas exhibited a high frequency in familial adenomatous polyposis patients (M. Miyaki et al., Cancer Res., 50: 7166-7173, 1990). In the present study, LOH at the DCC locus on chromosome 18q and the expression of DCC gene into mRNA were analyzed in colorectal tumors with distinct histopathological types. The carcinomas that showed 18q LOH also lost the DCC locus. The expression of DCC gene into mRNA was examined at the level of 233-base pair fragments of nucleotide 986-1218 in DCC complementary DNA. In a moderate-to-severe adenoma, 5 carcinoma-in-adenomas, and 4 intramucosal carcinomas, the level of expression was as high as in normal colorectal mucosa, whereas it was greatly reduced or not detectable in most (13 of 16) invasive carcinomas. Among these invasive carcinomas, 7 of 11 showed 18q LOH, but 4 showed no LOH. These results suggest that the DCC gene is included in the allelic deletion on chromosome 18q, and that the progression of colorectal carcinoma from early stage to advanced stage accompanies the inactivation of the DCC gene through LOH and other mechanisms.\n",

Expression of BCL-2 proteins in highly differentiated gastric and colonic tumours was roughly 1.2 times lower than in the normal cells. A 3.5-fold rise in BCL-2 expression was documented in a group of moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas and undifferentiated tumours. The most striking (9-fold) difference between BCL expression in untransformed and atypical cells was recorded in moderately differentiated metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical studies of BAX expression in untransformed and atypical gastric and colonic cells demonstrated activation of apoptosis-inducing mechanisms in the pathologically changed tissue. Investigations with the use of SSCP showed that 20% of the patients had BAX gene mutations affecting codons 38 to 41 of exone 3. This region was found to contain octadeoxyguanosine G8 sequence. The mutations were caused by deletion of G7 or insertion of G9.\n",

Cost-effectiveness has so far only been estimated for the group at high risk. The aim of the present study is to determine cost-effectiveness of surveillance programs where families at both high and moderate risk of HNPCC participate.\n\n## METHODS\nA decision analytic model (Markov model) is developed to assess surveillance programs where families at high and moderate risk of HNPCC are offered surveillance from age 25 and age 45, respectively. The model includes costs for all families referred to genetic counseling, including genetic risk assessment, mutation analysis, and surveillance in relevant families with or without known mutation, plus the costs related to any surgical treatment. The risk of metachronous CRC is also modeled.\n\n## RESULTS\nIncremental costs per life year gained are estimated to be euro 980 when families at both high and moderate risk of HNPCC undergo surveillance (euro 508 for high risk and euro 1600 for moderate risk) and euro 1947 when the moderate risk group is evaluated genetically but not offered surveillance. Sensitivity analysis showed these findings to be robust, although cost-effectiveness can be improved in cases of more conservative referrals to genetic counseling.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe result for high risk families confirms the findings in similar studies. Somewhat surprisingly, cost-effectiveness improves when surveillance of the moderate risk groups are included in the decision model.\n",

Recently, we identified the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation chain as a consistently overrepresented category in the published gene expression profiling (GEP) studies on CRC prognosis.\n\n## METHODS\nWe evaluated associations of putative regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes from the oxidative phosphorylation chain with survival and disease prognosis in 613 CRC patients from Northern Germany (PopGen cohort).\n\n## RESULTS\nTwo SNPs in the 3' untranslated region of UQCRB (complex III), rs7836698 and rs10504961, were associated with overall survival (HR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.32-0.85 and HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.99, for TT carriers). These associations were restricted to the group of patients with cancer located in the colon (HR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.82 and HR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.83). Multivariate analysis indicated that both markers might act as independent prognostic markers. Additionally, the TT carriers were ~2 times more likely to develop tumours in the colon than in the rectum. Two SNPs in COX6B1 (complex IV) were associated with lymph node metastasis in a dominant model (rs6510502, OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.20-2.57; rs10420252, OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.11-2.53); rs6510502 was associated also with distant metastasis (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.09-2.56 in a dominant model).\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis is the first report suggesting that markers in genes from the mitochondrial oxidative chain might be prognostic factors for CRC. Additional studies replicating the presented findings are needed.\n",

Secondary objectives included characterizing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and evaluating preliminary antitumor activity in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods Patients with metastatic, pretreated CRC were treated at five dose levels. Results Eighteen patients were recruited with median age 56.5\u00a0years. In the first five patients treated, 2 irinotecan related DLTs were observed. With reduced dose intensity irinotecan, there were no further DLTs. The most common toxicities were diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, anorexia and rash. DLTs included neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Two patients had partial responses (one with a KRAS mutation) and 8 had stable disease (8-36\u00a0weeks). The median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.5 and 4.7\u00a0months respectively. Pharmacokinetic analyses suggest sorafenib and metabolite exposure correlate with OS and DLTs. Conclusions The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is irinotecan 100\u00a0mg/m(2) i.v. days 1, 8; cetuximab 400\u00a0mg/m(2) i.v. days 1 and 250\u00a0mg/m(2) i.v. weekly; and sorafenib 400\u00a0mg orally twice daily in advanced, pretreated CRC. The combination resulted in a modest response rate.\n",

However, mice bearing null hPMS2 genes do not develop colon cancers and hPMS2 mutations in sporadic human colon cancers have not been described. Here we report that in Vaco481 colon cancer the hPMS2 gene is inactivated by somatic mutations of both hPMS2 alleles. The cell line derived from this tumor is functionally deficient in DNA mismatch repair. This deficiency can be biochemically complemented by addition of a purified hMLH1-hPMS2 (hMutLalpha) complex. The hPMS2 deficient Vaco481 cancer cell line demonstrates microsatellite instability, an elevated HPRT gene mutation rate, and resistance to the cytotoxicity of the alkylator MNNG. We conclude that somatic inactivation of hPMS2 can play a role in development of sporadic MSI colon cancer expressing the full range of cancer phenotypes associated with inactivation of the mismatch repair system.\n",

                "text": "Microsatellite instability in Korean patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.\n\n\n## OBJECTIVES\nMicrosatellites are short repeated oligonucleotide sequences found throughout the human genome. High mutation rates in microsatellite sequences have been found in tumors from patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma and some sporadic carcinomas. However, little information is available regarding RER-positive phenotype in gastric carcinomas, particularly in terms of age of onset and other pathologic features, such as histologic types, degree of differentiation, location or stage of the carcinoma.\n\n## METHODS\nTo obtain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of gastric carcinogenesis, microsatellite instability was examined at 6 gene loci (D2S71, D2S119, D3S1067, D6S87, D8S87, D11S905) in 77 gastric carcinomas (40 cases of young patients and 37 cases of elderly patients).\n\n## RESULTS\nRER-positive phenotypes were found in 17 (22.1%) of 77 cases. In young patients (under 40 years) RER-positive phenotype was found in 9 (22.5%) of 40 cases, and in elderly patients 8 (21.6%) of 37 cases. Moderately differentiated carcinoma revealed a significantly high frequency of RER-positive phenotype than well differentiated carcinoma(p < 0.001). Tumors arising from the middle third (p < 0.001) or lower third (p < 0.001) revealed higher frequency of RER-positive phenotype than the tumors arising from the upper third of the stomach. The RER-positive phenotype was not significantly affected by the sex, histologic type or stage of carcinoma.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nRER-positive phenotype occurs frequently in gastric carcinoma, although the frequency of RER-positive phenotype between young and elderly patient was not significantly different. Thus, the acquisition of RER-positive phenotype might be an early event in gastric carcinogenesis.\n",

By applying a series of stringent filters, we identified 418 genes with tumor specific disruptive somatic variants. Of these genes, three genes in mucin protein family (MUC2, MUC4, and MU12) are of particular interests. It has been reported that the expression of mucin proteins was correlated with the progression of colorectal cancer therefore somatic variants within those genes can interrupt their normal expression and thus contribute to the tumorigenesis.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur findings provide evidence of the utility of RNA-Seq in mutation screening in cancer studies, and suggest a list of candidate genes for future colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n",

                "text": "Prevention of colorectal cancer by colonoscopic surveillance in families with hereditary colorectal cancer.\n\n\n## OBJECTIVE\nIn recent years persons at risk for colorectal cancers (CRC) have been subjected to follow-up with colonoscopy in many centres. There is, however, limited knowledge about the effect of such interventions. The objective of this study was to report the results of our observations during the past 15 years.\n\n## MATERIAL AND METHODS\nHealthy persons were included in the study according to their family history of CRCs, and prospectively followed with colonoscopies.\n\n## RESULTS\nAltogether, 1133 individuals were included and observed for a total of 3474 follow-up years from the first to the last colonoscopy initiated by our activity. Mismatch repair (MMR) mutations were detected in 6.5% of cases. A total of 1383 polyps were removed, 72% were less than 5 mm in diameter. Findings were scored as hyperplastic polyps (n=887), adenomas with mild to moderate dysplasia (n=460), adenomas with high-grade dysplasia (n=30) and cancers (n=6). Two cancers were observed after the first colonoscopy, compared with 2.6 expected by chance and more than 20 expected under the hypothesis of predominant inherited diseases in the families. Observed annual incidence rates for adenomas were similar in all groups, while in the mutation carriers there was a higher frequency of progression to severe dysplasia or infiltrating cancer.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA simple explanation for the combined findings may be that all selected families had a similar tendency to produce adenomas, while mutation carriers more frequently demonstrated dysplasia/cancer in the adenomas. The low annual incidence rates for CRC indicated that the removal of adenomas may have prevented cancers.\n",

                "text": "Variations in genes regulating tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to predict outcomes of bevacizumab-based treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: results from TRIBE and FIRE3 trials.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\nTumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with the M2-like phenotype are regulated by mainly NF-kB pathway including TBK1, which can influence tumor progression by secretion of proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor. The CCL2/CCR2 axis, histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), and placenta growth factor (PIGF) play a critical role in the polarization of M1/M2 phenotypes and the recruitment of TAMs to tumor microenvironment. We therefore hypothesized that variations in genes involved in regulating TAMs may predict clinical outcomes of bevacizumab treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).\n\n## PATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe analyzed genomic DNA extracted from samples of patients receiving bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI as a first-line treatment using PCR-based direct sequencing. Twelve functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in eight genes (CCL2, CCR2, HRG, PIGF, NFKB1, TBK1, CCL18, and IRF3) were tested for associations with clinical outcomes in a discovery cohort of 228 participants in TRIBE trial (NCT00719797), then validated in 248 KRAS exon2 (KRAS) wild-type participants in FIRE3 trial (NCT00433927). FIRE3-cetuximab cohort served as a negative control.\n\n## RESULTS\nTBK1 rs7486100 was significantly associated with overall survival in 95 KRAS wild-type patients of TRIBE cohort in univariate analysis and had a strong trend in multivariable analysis; furthermore, the association of the T allele was observed for progression-free survival (PFS) in both univariate and multivariable analyses in FIRE3-bevacizumab but not cetuximab cohort. CCL2 rs4586, CCL18 rs14304, and IRF3 rs2304205 had univariate and multivariable correlations with PFS in KRAS mutant patients of the TRIBE cohort, whereas they had no correlations in KRAS wild-type patients of the TRIBE cohort. No association was seen in control cohort.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur study demonstrates for the first time that variations in genes regulating TAMs-related functions are significantly associated with clinical outcomes in mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy. These results also suggest that some TAM-related gene variations may predict outcomes of bevacizumab treatment in KRAS status-dependent manner.\n",

Low-penetrance alleles of genes in many biological pathways, such as DNA repair, metabolism, inflammation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and Wnt signaling, may influence the risk of nonfamilial colorectal cancer. To identify susceptibility genes for colorectal cancer, we designed a large-scale case-control association study nested within the Nurses' Health Study (190 cases and 190 controls) and the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study (168 cases and 168 controls). We used a custom GoldenGate (Illumina) oligonucleotide pool assay including 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) selected in candidate genes from cancer-related pathways, which have been sequenced and genotyped in the SNP500Cancer project; 1,412 of the 1,536 (92%) of the SNPs were genotyped successfully within 388 genes. SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (r(2) >/= 0.90) with another assayed SNP were excluded from further analyses. As expected by chance (and not significant compared with a corrected Bonferroni P = 0.00004), in the additive model, 11 of 1,253 (0.9%) SNPs had a P(trend) < 0.01 and 38 of 1,253 (3.0%) SNPs had a P(trend) >/= 0.01 and P(trend) < 0.05. Of note, the MGMT Lys(178)Arg (rs2308237) SNP, in linkage disequilibrium with the previously reported MGMT Ile(143)Val SNP, had an inverse association with colorectal cancer risk (MGMT Lys(178)Arg: odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.78; unadjusted P(trend) = 0.0003 for the additive model; gene-based test global P = 0.00003). The SNP500Cancer database and the Illumina GoldenGate Assay allowed us to test a larger number of SNPs than previously possible. We identified several SNPs worthy of investigation in larger studies.\n",

Like other tumor suppressor genes, the loss-of-function mutations found in the DPC4 gene are specific to cancer cells. This provides an attractive and unique opportunity for therapeutic intervention. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize small molecules that selectively kill DPC4-deficient cancer cells.\n\n## METHODS\nAn unbiased chemical screening using isogenic cell lines that only differ in the DPC4 gene was carried out to identify positive hits. Selected hits were further verified in additional isogenic cell lines and characterized in cancer cells using several different cellular assays.\n\n## RESULTS\nA lead molecule, UA62784, was identified to be selectively cytotoxic against cancer cells with deficient DPC4. UA62784 preferentially induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cells with deficient DPC4. It also selectively reduces the clonogenicity of DPC4-deficient cells on soft agar when compared with cells with wild type DPC4. We further demonstrate that UA62784 induces CDC2 kinase activity preferentially in DPC4-negative cells.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nUA62784 is a small molecule that selectively kills DPC4-deficient cancer cells. Its potent activity and relatively low molecular weight make it a decent candidate for further lead optimization.\n",

Of 20 tissue samples with dysplasia, six showed positive immunoreactivity. Archival paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from 21 colitic cancers were analysed; 11 showed positive immunoreactivity, compared with ten of 21 samples from matched sporadic colorectal cancers (P not significant). Previous data suggesting that colorectal carcinoma complicating ulcerative colitis has a reduced frequency of c-Ki-ras mutation compared with sporadic cancer have led to the hypothesis that different genetic lesions underlie colitic and sporadic colorectal carcinoma. The present results suggest that this is not the case with regard to p53 gene alterations.\n",

Personal information was collected by a Semi-Quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire. The tagSNPs were screened in the HapMap with Haploview by setting the minor allele frequency at 0.03 with the highest score of r(2) form each block. Genotypes were identified by using the SNPLex System. Both crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to evaluate the risk of each SNP.\n\n## RESULTS\nSixteen tagSNPs were selected, and 13 were successfully genotyped. A novel CYP2E1 locus rs1329149 and a known ALDH2 locus rs671 were found to be significantly associated with CRC risk. The adjusted OR was 1.86 (95% CI, 1.12-3.09) for the rs671 A/A genotype and 4.04 for the rs1329149 T/T genotype (95% CI, 2.44-6.70), compared with their common homozygous genotypes. Interaction was found between alcohol consumption and gene polymorphisms on CRC, the adjusted OR was 7.17 (95% CI, 2.01-25.53) for drinking habits combined with rs671 A/A or rs1329149 T/T genotype.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nThe results of this study suggest that rs671 A/A and the first reported locus rs1329149 T/T genotypes increase the susceptibility to CRC, and gene-environmental interaction between the two loci and alcohol use existed for CRC in Southwestern Chinese. Larger studies are warranted to verify our findings.\n",

A report of 121 families with proven mutations.\n\nHereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by inactivating mutations of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. An accurate estimation of colorectal cancer risk for mutation carriers is essential for counselling and rationalizing screening programmes. Families were referred on the basis of clinical criteria. Tumour immunohistochemistry and microsatellite testing were performed. Appropriate patients underwent sequencing of all relevant exons of the MMR genes. Proven and obligate mutation carriers and first-degree relatives (FDRs) with an HNPCC spectrum cancer were considered mutation carriers, as were a proportion of untested, unaffected FDRs based on the proportion of unaffected relatives testing positive in each age group. The cumulative lifetime risk was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Three hundred and forty-one colorectal cancers in 839 proven, obligate, or assumed mutation carriers were analysed. The cumulative risk to age 70 years for all mutation carriers combined was 50.4% (95% CI 47.8-52.9). The cumulative risk in males was 54.3% (95% CI 50.7-57.8), which was significantly higher than in females (log rank p = 0.02) who had a risk of 46.3% (95% CI 42.8-49.9). These penetrance estimates from HNPCC families attending high-risk clinics have been corrected for ascertainment bias and are appropriate risks for those referred to a high-risk clinic. Current colonoscopic screening guidelines are appropriate.\n",

To identify such genetic factors we stringently selected a discovery cohort of 41 CRC index patients with microsatellite-stable tumors. All patients were below 40 years of age at diagnosis and/or exhibited an overt family history. We employed genome-wide copy number profiling using high-resolution SNP arrays on germline DNA, which resulted in the identification of novel copy number variants (CNVs) in six patients (15%) encompassing, among others, the cadherin gene CDH18, the bone morphogenetic protein antagonist family gene GREM1, and the breakpoint cluster region gene BCR. In addition, two genomic deletions were encountered encompassing two microRNA genes, hsa-mir-491/KIAA1797 and hsa-mir-646/AK309218. None of these CNVs has previously been reported in relation to CRC predisposition in humans, nor were they encountered in large control cohorts (>1,600 unaffected individuals). Since several of these newly identified candidate genes may be functionally linked to CRC development, our results illustrate the potential of this approach for the identification of novel candidate genes involved in CRC predisposition.\n",

                "text": "[Familial adenomatous polyposis coli in the Czech population. I. Detection of an additional 3 mutations out of a total of 7 in exon 15 of the APC gene].\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by multiple adenomatous polyps in the colon which progress to carcinoma. FAP is caused by germ-line mutation of the tumor-suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, the structure and coding sequence of which have been known from 1991. The diagnosis of FAP has classically been based on the detection of multiple colorectal adenomas, often after carcinoma development. Presymptomatic genetic testing for the presence of an allele carrying the FAP mutation is now possible using a variety of techniques.\n\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nThe present paper is the first part of an analysis of 37 different Czech families with 83 members affected by FAP. Our goal is to identify the mutation characteristic for each family for early diagnosis of FAP. We screened clinically manifest representatives of nine families for mutations in exon 15 of the APC gene. First, we searched for the mutation hot spots (codons 1061 and 1309, respectively) and later for the entire exon 15. Denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of amplified regions ov exon 15 has been used to identify DNA sequence variations followed by sequencing verification. In seven patients, seven different mutations in exon 15 of APC gene, four deletion mutants (5-base deletions in codons 1061 and 1309, 1-base deletion in codons 759 and 7-base deletion combined with a 2-base insertion in codon 712), one insertion mutation (1-base/A/insertion in codon 1554) and two point mutations (C to T and C to A substitutions in codons 737 and 935, respectively, in both cases leading to formation of stop codons) have been found.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFrom seven different mutations found, 4 mutations have been previously described (mutations in codons 935, 1061, 1309 and 1554), 3 mutations in the APC gene are described here for the first time, namely the mutations in codons 712, 759 and 767.\n",

This study investigated the changes in the level of expression of a well-defined panel of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis markers between the primary colorectal cancer (CRC) and the corresponding synchronous lymph node (LN) metastasis from the same patients. DNA flow cytometry and immunostaining of p53, bcl-2, and c-myc were carried out on 36 cases of CRC radical resection specimens with their corresponding LN metastases. There was very low probability that the histological patterns of primary tumors and LN metastases are independent (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Metastatic tumors were significantly more diffusely positive for p53 than the primary tumors (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Conversely, primary tumors were significantly more diffusely positive for c-myc than metastatic tumors (p\u2009=\u20090.011). No significant difference was found between the LNs and the primary tumors in bcl-2 positivity (p\u2009=\u20090.538) and DNA aneuploidy (p\u2009=\u20090.35), with a tendency towards negative bcl-2 and less aneuploidy in LN metastases than primary tumors. In conclusion, LN metastatic colorectal carcinomas have a tendency of being less differentiated, with a higher incidence of diffuse p53 staining, lower incidence of bcl-2 staining, and less aneuploidy in comparison to their primary counterparts suggesting a more aggressive biological behavior, which could indicate the necessity for more aggressive adjuvant therapy.\n",

                "text": "BRAFV600E immunohistochemistry facilitates universal screening of colorectal cancers for Lynch syndrome.\n\nBRAFV600E mutation in microsatellite-unstable (MSI) colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) virtually excludes Lynch syndrome (LS). In microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRCs it predicts poor prognosis. We propose a universal CRC LS screening algorithm using concurrent reflex immunohistochemistry (IHC) for BRAFV600E and mismatch-repair (MMR) proteins. We compared BRAFV600E IHC with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry in 216 consecutive CRCs from 2011. Discordant cases were resolved with real-time PCR. BRAFV600E IHC was performed on 51 CRCs from the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (ACCFR), which were fully characterized for BRAF mutation by allele-specific PCR, MMR status (MMR IHC and MSI), MLH1 promoter methylation, and germline MLH1 mutation. We then assessed MMR and BRAFV600E IHC on 1403 consecutive CRCs. By matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry 15 cases did not yield a BRAF result, whereas 38/201 (19%) were positive. By IHC 45/216 (20%) were positive. Of the 7 discordant cases, real-time PCR confirmed the IHC result in 6. In the 51 CRCs from the ACCFR, IHC was concordant with allele-specific PCR in 50 cases. BRAFV600E and MSI IHC on 1403 CRCs demonstrated the following phenotypes: BRAF/MSS (1029 cases, 73%), BRAF/MSS (98, 7%), BRAF/MSI (183, 13%), and BRAF/MSI (93, 7%). All 11/1403 cancers associated with proven LS were BRAF/MSI. We conclude that BRAF IHC is highly concordant with 2 commonly used PCR-based BRAFV600E assays; it performed well in identifying MLH1 mutation carriers from the ACCFR and identified all cases of proven LS among the 1403 CRCs. Reflex BRAFV600E and MMR IHC are simple cheap tests that facilitate universal LS screening and identify the poor prognosis of the BRAFV600E-mutant MSS CRC phenotype.\n",

Here, we describe two unrelated cases of FAP with unusual extracolonic phenotypes, namely several abnormalities of mesodermal origin strongly resembling Marfan syndrome (MFS) or a Marfan-like habitus. Conventional cytogenetic and FISH analysis did not reveal any gross chromosomal rearrangement on the long arm of chromosome 5 where the APC and FBN2 genes were located. However, in case 2 the FAP-causing mutation in the APC gene was found in the donor splice site of exon 4 and was shown to result in a frameshift and a premature termination codon. We propose that such connective tissue abnormalities may result from germline APC mutations in combination with specific genetic and/or environmental modifying factors.\n",

The tremendous gains in the knowledge of the structure and function of human genes will surely impact the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer. Moreover, it will lead to more effective cancer control through the use of genetics to quantify individual cancer risks. This article reviews the current status of genetic testing and counseling for cancer risk assessment and will suggest a framework for integrating such counseling into oncology practice.\n",

                "text": "Associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in miR-146a, miR-196a, miR-149 and miR-499 with colorectal cancer susceptibility.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of endogenous small non-coding RNAs of 20-25 nucleotides in length that function as negative gene regulators. MiRNAs play roles in most biological processes, as well as diverse human diseases including cancer. Recently, many studies investigated the association between SNPs in miR-146a rs2910164, miR-196a2 rs11614913, miR-149 rs229283, miR-499 rs3746444 and colorectal cancer (CRC), which results have been inconclusive.\n\n## METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nPubMed, EMBASE, CNKI databases were searched with the last search updated on November 5, 2013. For miR-196a2 rs11614913, a significantly decreased risk of CRC development was observed under three genetic models (dominant model: OR = 0.848, 95%CI: 0.735-0.979, P = 0.025; recessive model: OR = 0.838, 95%CI: 0.721-0.974, P = 0.021; homozygous model: OR = 0.754, 95%CI: 0.627-0.907, P = 0.003). In the subgroup analyses, miR-196a2*T variant was associated with a significantly decreased susceptibility of CRC (allele model: OR = 0.839, 95%CI: 0.749-0.940, P = 0.000; dominant model: OR = 0.770, 95%CI: 0.653-0.980, P = 0.002; recessive model: OR = 0.802, 95%CI: 0.685-0.939, P = 0.006; homozygous model: OR = 0.695, 95%CI: 0.570-0.847, P = 0.000). As for miR-149 rs2292832, the two genetic models (recessive model: OR = 1.199, 95% CI 1.028-1.398, P = 0.021; heterozygous model: OR = 1.226, 95% CI 1.039-1.447, P = 0.013) demonstrated increased susceptibility to CRC. On subgroup analysis, significantly increased susceptibility of CRC was found in the genetic models (recessive model: OR = 1.180, 95% CI 1.008-1.382, P = 0.040; heterozygous model: OR = 1.202, 95% CI 1.013-1.425, P = 0.013) in the Asian group.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese findings supported that the miR-196a2 rs11614913 and miR-149 rs2292832 polymorphisms may contribute to susceptibility to CRC.\n",

However, the classification of terminal truncating mutations is sometimes difficult and predictive testing based on non-deleterious variants can have very serious consequences. Here, we report eight probands that have two germline nonsense mutations, namely MSH6 c.1030C>T, p.(Gln344Ter) and MSH2 c.2785C>T, p.(Arg929Ter), and one additional patient who presented only the MSH2 mutation previously reported as deleterious. The novel MSH6 truncating mutation was classified as deleterious, as it is predicted to encode a protein with loss of 1017 amino acid residues. The MSH2 mutation, which is expected to encode a protein lacking six amino acid residues, was considered a variant of unknown significance. Five tumors of the eight double-mutant individuals had normal MSH2 expression, whereas MSH6 immunoexpression was lost in all evaluable cases. None of the variants were detected in normal controls or associated with other MMR germline mutations in our series. This study emphasizes that not all truncating mutations are equal and that one must be cautious in the interpretation of the presumed deleterious effect of terminal frameshift or nonsense mutations.\n",

These samples were also screened to search mutations in the repeat sequences in the gene for the type II receptor of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta RII) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), electrophoresis with urea gel, and PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method. The incidence of microsatellite instability, defined as severe replication error phenotype (RER) with microsatellite alterations in more than three loci, was 6%. Deletion and insertion of an A residue in the (A)10 region, which cause frameshift mutation, were found in four samples and their incidence in the samples with microsatellite instability was 80%. A novel nucleotide substitution of T for G at 1918, which causes missense mutation of arginine to leucine at codon 528, was found in a sample with microsatellite instability. The mutation at 1918 was in highly conservative amino acid residue.\n",

                "text": "Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis of COX-2 and risk of colorectal adenoma development.\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter and untranslated region of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, an inducible enzyme responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins, have been reported to modulate the risk for many human cancers. We performed comprehensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analyses of 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the COX-2 gene and examined its susceptibility to adenoma development in 72 African American cases and 142 controls. Results revealed significant variation in LD patterns with consequence for adenoma development. Two distinct haplotype blocks were identified; one block covered the coding regions of exon 1, introns and a section of the 3'-unstranslated region (3'-UTR), whereas the second block resided solely in the 3'-UTR region. A haplotype in block 1 increased the risk of adenoma development by threefold (odds ratio [OR]= 2.9, confidence interval [CI]= 1.8-3.7, P= 0.002). Regression analysis showed, increase in copies of minor alleles of 6,064(T>C) polymorphism associated with increased odds of adenoma development by 80% (OR = 1.80, CI = 1.09-3.21, P= 0.034), 10,848(G>A) by 84% (OR = 1.84, CI = 1.05-3.23, P= 0.034) and 10,935(A>G) by 32% (OR = 1.32, CI = 1.12-3.69, P= 0.036). These results support the hypothesis that COX-2 gene might play a role in the etiology of colon cancer and warrant further investigation in other cancers. Besides, these variations should be taken into account for disease-based association studies in which the COX-2 polymorphism is considered as a candidate gene.

                "text": "The frequency of previously undetectable deletions involving 3' Exons of the PMS2 gene.\n\nLynch syndrome is characterized by mutations in one of four mismatch repair genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2. Clinical mutation analysis of these genes includes sequencing of exonic regions and deletion/duplication analysis. However, detection of deletions and duplications in PMS2 has previously been confined to Exons 1-11 due to gene conversion between PMS2 and the pseudogene PMS2CL in the remaining 3' exons (Exons 12-15). We have recently described an MLPA-based method that permits detection of deletions of PMS2 Exons 12-15; however, the frequency of such deletions has not yet been determined. To address this question, we tested for 3' deletions in 58 samples that were reported to be negative for PMS2 mutations using previously available methods. All samples were from individuals whose tumors exhibited loss of PMS2 immunohistochemical staining without concomitant loss of MLH1 immunostaining. We identified seven samples in this cohort with deletions in the 3' region of PMS2, including three previously reported samples with deletions of Exons 13-15 (two samples) and Exons 14-15. Also detected were deletions of Exons 12-15, Exon 13, and Exon 14 (two samples). Breakpoint analysis of the intragenic deletions suggests they occurred through Alu-mediated recombination. Our results indicate that \u223c12% of samples suspected of harboring a PMS2 mutation based on immunohistochemical staining, for which mutations have not yet been identified, would benefit from testing using the new methodology.\n",

Previous studies have shown that NGX6 gene is down-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, little is known about its transcriptional regulation.\n\n## RESULTS\nWe defined the minimal promoter of NGX6 gene in a 186-bp region (from-86 to +100) through mutation construct methods and luciferase assays. Results from Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that Early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) binds to the Sp1/Egr-1 overlapping site of NGX6 minimal promoter. Overexpression of Egr-1 increased the promoter activity and mRNA level of NGX6 gene; while knock-down of endogenous Egr-1 decreased mRNA expression of NGX6 gene.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nThese results demonstrate that Egr-1 regulates NGX6 gene transcription through an overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 binding site as a positive regulator of NGX6 gene.\n",

Defective MUTYH activity causes G:C to T:A transversions in tumour APC and other genes thereby altering genomic integrity. We report that of the four established cell lines, derived from patients with the MAP phenotype and containing biallelic MUTYH mutations, three contain altered expressions of MUTYH protein (MUTYH Y165C(-/-), MUTYH 1103delC/G382D and MUTYH Y165C/G382D but not MUTYH G382D(-/-)), but that all four cell lines have wild type levels of MUTYH mRNA. Mutant MUTYH proteins in these four cell lines possess significantly lowered binding and cleavage activities with heteroduplex oligonucleotides containing A.8-oxoG and 8-oxoA.G mispairs. Transfection of mitochondrial or nuclear MUTYH cDNAs partially correct altered MUTYH expression and activity in these defective cell lines. Finally, we surprisingly find that defective MUTYH may not alter cell survival after hydrogen peroxide and menadione treatments. The Y165C and 1103delC mutations significantly reduce MUTYH protein stability and thus repair activity, whereas the G382D mutation produces dysfunctional protein only suggesting different functional molecular mechanisms by which the MAP phenotype may contribute to the development of CRC.\n",

TSAs with an SSA/P precursor lesion were usually found in the proximal colon, while TSAs with an HP or with no precursor lesion were mainly located in the distal colon and rectum (P < .001). TSAs with a precursor lesion showed a lower frequency of conventional epithelial dysplasia and KRAS mutation as well as a higher frequency of BRAF mutation compared with those with no precursor lesion (P = .002, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively).\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA significant proportion of HP or SSA/P precursor lesions accompanied by TSAs can be detected by endoscopy based on both their flat-elevated growth and type II pit patterns. The heterogeneity of TSAs in terms of clinicopathologic and molecular features correlated with the status or type of precursor lesions.\n",

The RPC procedure carries a higher morbidity but, unlike IRA, removes the risk of subsequent rectal cancer. Since the course of familial adenomatous polyposis is influenced by the site of mutation in the polyposis gene, DNA analysis might be helpful in treatment decisions.\n\n## METHODS\nWe evaluated the incidence of rectal cancer in polyposis patients who had undergone IRA, and examined whether the requirement for subsequent rectal excision because of cancer or uncontrollable polyps was related to the site of mutation.\n\n## FINDINGS\nBetween 1956 and mid-1995, 225 patients registered at the Netherlands Polyposis Registry had undergone IRA. In 87 of them, a pathogenetic mutation was detected. 72 patients had a mutation located before codon 1250 and 15 patients after this codon. The cumulative risk of rectal cancer 20 years after surgery was 12%, and at that time 42% had undergone rectal excision. The risk of secondary surgery was higher in patients with mutations in the region after codon 1250 than in patients with mutations before this codon (relative risk 2.7, p < 0.05).\n\n## INTERPRETATION\nOn this evidence, IRA should be the primary treatment for polyposis in patients with mutations before codon 1250, and RPC in those with mutations after this codon.\n",

                "text": "Progression of colorectal cancer is associated with multiple tumor suppressor gene defects but inhibition of tumorigenicity is accomplished by correction of any single defect via chromosome transfer.\n\nCarcinogenesis is a multistage process that has been characterized both by the activation of cellular oncogenes and by the loss of function of tumor suppressor genes. Colorectal cancer has been associated with the activation of ras oncogenes and with the deletion of multiple chromosomal regions including chromosomes 5q, 17p, and 18q. Such chromosome loss is often suggestive of the deletion or loss of function of tumor suppressor genes. The candidate tumor suppressor genes from these regions are, respectively, MCC and/or APC, p53, and DCC. In order to further our understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in tumor progression and, thereby, of normal cell growth, it is important to determine whether defects in one or more of these loci contribute functionally in the progression to malignancy in colorectal cancer and whether correction of any of these defects restores normal growth control in vitro and in vivo. To address this question, we have utilized the technique of microcell-mediated chromosome transfer to introduce normal human chromosomes 5, 17, and 18 individually into recipient colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, chromosome 15 was introduced into SW480 cells as an irrelevant control chromosome. While the introduction of chromosome 17 into the tumorigenic colorectal cell line SW480 yielded no viable clones, cell lines were established after the introduction of chromosomes 15, 5, and 18. Hybrids containing chromosome 18 are morphologically similar to the parental line, whereas those containing chromosome 5 are morphologically distinct from the parental cell line, being small, polygonal, and tightly packed. SW480-chromosome 5 hybrids are strongly suppressed for tumorigenicity, while SW480-chromosome 18 hybrids produce slowly growing tumors in some of the animals injected. Hybrids containing the introduced chromosome 18 but was significantly reduced in several of the tumor reconstitute cell lines. Introduction of chromosome 5 had little to no effect on responsiveness, whereas transfer ot chromosome 18 restored responsiveness to some degree. Our findings indicate that while multiple defects in tumor suppressor genes seem to be required for progression to the malignant state in colorectal cancer, correction of only a single defect can have significant effects in vivo and/or in vitro.\n",

Subsequently the cAMP pathway mediates various pleiotropic effects including regulation of apoptosis and proliferation. We have recently shown that genotypes of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T393C in the gene GNAS1 are associated with survival of patients suffering from bladder, renal cell and colorectal carcinoma. In the present study, the genotypes of the T393C SNP were determined in 279 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Comparing the genotypes with the overall survival as well as important clinico-pathological parameters showed that carriers of the T allele had a significantly less favourable course of the disease when compared to carriers of the homozygous CC genotype. In multivariate analysis the homozygous TT genotype was independently associated with a decreased overall survival. Our results suggest that the GNAS1 T393C SNP is a novel genetic host factor for disease progression in patients with invasive breast carcinoma.\n",

To date, no conclusions could be available because of controversial results reported. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to further assess the associations. We searched the databases of Medline, Embase, and Wangfang to identify eligible studies, and latest update was on January 1, 2012. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated to present the associations. Our meta-analysis indicated that TGF-\u03b21 -509 C > T, +869 T > C, +915 G > C, and -800 G > A were not associated with risk of colorectal adenoma (OR = 0.89 for C carriers vs. TT for -509 C > T, 1.03 for C carriers vs. TT for +869 T > C, 1.09 for C carriers vs. GG for +915 G > C, and 1.19 for A carriers vs. GG for 800 G > A). However, C allele of TGF-\u03b21 -509 C > T and A allele of -800 G > A were associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), and OR (95%CI) was 1.23 (0.99-1.52) for CC vs. TT for -509 C > T and 6.64 (3.46-12.72) for A carriers vs. GG. The positive association between -509 C allele and risk of CRC was more obvious when subgroup analyses were conducted for population-based and large sample-sized studies as well as Caucasians. In contrast, we did not observed any associations between TGF-\u03b21\u2009+869 T > C, +915 G > C, and risk of CRC. This study indicated that C allele of TGF-\u03b21-509 C > T and A allele of -800 G > A might contribute to the increased risk of CRC, and could be used as two of genetic marks for screening individuals at high risk of CRC. Because of modest limitation, large sample-sized studies were required to confirm the findings.\n",

Our novel family history-based approach allows economical association studies for multiple cancers, without genotyping of relatives (as required in family studies), follow-up of participants (as required in cohort studies), or oversampling of specific cancer cases (as required in case-control studies). We empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed family history-based approach in studying associations with prostate and ovarian cancers, using data from GWA studies previously conducted within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. The family history-based method may be particularly useful for investigating genetic susceptibility to rare diseases for which accruing cases may be very difficult, by using disease information from nongenotyped relatives of participants in multiple case-control and cohort studies designed primarily for other purposes.\n",

The conventional wisdom was that these cells disintegrate upon exfoliation and will not survive the transit through the intestinal tract. In 1990, we (P.N.) made the discovery that a significant number of these cells remain intact and viable and that they can be isolated. The implications of this important discovery became apparent when we demonstrated that these cells are exclusively of colonic origin, are anatomically representative of the entire colon, and can be used for clinical investigations of disease processes. The term coprocytobiology (CCB) was coined to encompass the broad range of applications of this new technology. The somatic cell sampling and recovery (SCSR) process involves the isolation of exfoliated colonocytes from a small sample of stool ( approximately 1 g) collected and transported in a unique medium at ambient temperature, providing cells for the detection of a number of biomarkers of disease propensity. These exfoliated colonocytes express cytokeratins indicating epithelial lineage as well as colon-specific antigen. Over the years, the study of exfoliated colonocytes has provided striking new insights into the biology of colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease, including detection of p53 gene mutations, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification, and identification of CD44 splice variants, neoplasia-associated specific binding of plant lectins, and expression of COX-2, the inducible form of cyclooxygenase. The functional diversity of cells isolated by SCSR is revealed by the demonstration of cell surface markers such as secretory component, IgA, and IgG on the one hand and the amplification and cloning of the human insulin receptor and the expression of the multidrug resistance gene mdr-1 on the other hand. This review portrays the immense potential of CCB as a powerful tool for investigating the pathophysiology of disease, identifying genetic variants in pharmacogenetics, assessment of mucosal immunity, and several other applications that use somatic cells.\n",

Guided by Leventhal's Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation, we examined demographic and psychosocial factors possibly associated with interest in SNP testing. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with interest in SNP testing and preferences for receiving genomic risk communications.\n\n## RESULTS\nThree-fourths of participants expressed interest in SNP testing for colorectal cancer risk. Testing interest did not markedly change across behavior modifier scenarios. Participants preferred to receive genomic risk communications from a variety of sources: printed materials (69.5%), oncologists (54.8%), primary-care physicians (58.4%), and the web (58.1%). Overall, persons who were unmarried (p = 0.029), younger (p = 0.003) and with greater cancer-related fear (p = 0.019) were more likely to express interest in predictive genomic testing for colorectal cancer risk. In a stratified analysis, cancer-related fear was associated with the interest in predictive genomic testing in the intervention group (p = 0.017), but not the control group.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIndividuals with intermediate familial risk for colorectal cancer are highly interested in genomic testing for modest increases in disease risk, specifically unmarried persons, younger age groups and those with greater cancer fear.\n",

                "text": "Association between survivin gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to colon cancer development in the Turkish population.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\nColon cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Apoptosis is a necessary physiological process for cell elimination which is very important both cellular homeostasis and cell proliferation and differantiation. Dysregulation can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor development. Survivin, a member of the IAP family, plays a key role in promotion of cell proliferation as well as inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether specific genetic polymorphisms of survivin could be associated with colon cancer development and progression in a Turkish population. Our study is the first to our knowledge to investigate the relationship between colon cancer risk and survivin gene polymorphisms.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe relation between colon cancer and survivin -31 G/C (rs9904341), -241 C/T (rs17878467) and -625 C/G (rs8073069) polymorphism in promotor site of survivin gene associated with apoptosis was investigated using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.\n\n## RESULTS\nIndividuals with -31C allele and CC genotype were found to have a higher risk of developing colon cancer (OR=13.4, p=0.01). The -241 CT genotype considerably increased the risk of colon cancer (OR=12.0, p=0.0001). However, there was no significant varaition of the survivin -625 C/G polymorphism among colon cancer patients and controls in our study.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis study provides the first evidence that survivin -31 G/C and -241 C/T SNP significantly contribute to the risk of colon cancer in the Turkish population.\n",

PVT-1, which encodes a long noncoding RNA, mapped to chromosome 8q24 whose copy-number amplification is one of the most frequent events in a wide variety of malignant diseases. However, PVT-1 molecular mechanism of action remains unclear.\n\n## METHODS\nWe conducted cell proliferation and invasion assays using colorectal cancer cell lines transfected with PVT-1siRNA or negative control siRNA. Gene expression microarray analyses on these cell lines were also carried out to investigate the molecular function of PVT-1. Further, we investigated the impact of PVT-1 expression on the prognosis of 164 colorectal cancer patients by qRT-PCR.\n\n## RESULTS\nCRC cells transfected with PVT-1 siRNA exhibited significant loss of their proliferation and invasion capabilities. In these cells, the TGF-\u03b2 signalling pathway and apoptotic signals were significantly activated. In addition, univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that PVT-1 expression level was an independent risk factor for overall survival of colorectal cancer patients.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nPVT-1, which maps to 8q24, generates antiapoptotic activity in CRC, and abnormal expression of PVT-1 was a prognostic indicator for CRC patients.\n",

Four samples were analyzed from each tumor. Patients were followed for 41-65 months (average, 53). DNA heterogeneity (both aneuploid and nonaneuploid patterns) was present in 44% of the cases. Sixty-eight percent of the tumors showed an aneuploid DNA pattern in at least one of the samples. Patients with nonaneuploid tumors tended to have a survival advantage over patients with homogeneously aneuploid tumors and demonstrated a significantly longer disease-free survival. The DNA ploidy pattern is of potential value in conjunction with histopathologic prognostic parameters in colorectal carcinoma. Since colorectal tumors exhibit pronounced DNA heterogeneity, multiple samples are required from each tumor to permit a proper evaluation of its DNA pattern. The DNA heterogeneity may represent tumor progression and can partly explain the conflicting results reported concerning DNA pattern and prognosis in colorectal carcinoma.\n",

The aim of this research was to study whether polymorphisms of CHCHD3P1-HSP90AB7P, GRID1, HSPA12A, PRLHR, SBF2, POLD3 and C11orf93-C11orf92 genes are associated with the risk of gastric and colorectal cancers in the Chinese Han population.\n\n## METHODS\nWe genotyped seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from seven genes. We selected 588 patients with gastric cancer and 449 with colorectal cancer, along with 703 healthy controls. All these SNPs were evaluated using the \u03c7\u00b2 test and genetic model analysis.\n\n## RESULTS\nThe genotype \"A/T\" of rs12413624 in PRLHR gene was associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer in allele model analysis [odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20090.81; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20090.68-0.97; p\u2009=\u20090.018] and log-additive model analysis (OR\u2009=\u20090.81; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.66-0.98; p\u2009=\u20090.032). The genotype \"A/G\" of rs1665650 in HSPA12A gene was associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer in overdominant model analysis (OR\u2009=\u20090.77; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.60-0.99; p\u2009=\u20090.038).\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur results provide evidence that variants of PRLHR gene are a protective factor in colorectal cancer and variants of HSPA12A gene are a protective factor in gastric cancer in the Chinese Han population.\n",

Patient DNA sequencing information may lead to a personalized approach to managing an individual's cancer as well as future cancer risk. The success of this approach, however, begins not necessarily in the clinician's office, but rather at the laboratory bench of the basic scientist. The basic scientist plays a critical role since the DNA sequencing information is of limited use unless one knows the function of the gene that is altered and the manner by which a sequence alteration affects that function. The role of basic science research in aiding the clinical management of a disease is perhaps best exemplified by considering the case of Lynch syndrome, a hereditary disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers. This review will examine how the diagnosis, treatment and even prevention of Lynch syndrome-associated cancers has benefitted from extensive basic science research on the DNA mismatch repair genes whose alteration underlies this condition.\n",

The proximal 6.6 kb of the COX-2 promoter was cloned into the pGL3 basic vector and the sequential deletion of the 6.6 kb COX-2 promoter generated promoter constructs of 4, 2.6, 1.9 and 0.9 kb. These constructs clearly show that the main regulatory region lies within 0.9 kb of the transcription start site. Therefore, constructs of the main transcription binding sites within this region namely CRE, NF-IL6 and NF-kappaB and mutations of these sites were used to monitor the transcriptional activation of COX-2. This study was performed on the colon cancer cell lines HCA7 and HCT116 which have a differential expression of COX-2. There was no evidence that the luciferase activity is negatively affected by NO as was previously reported. The CRE and NF-IL6 binding sites within this region were responsible for the constitutive and physiological NO-induced COX-2 transcriptional activity in the HCA7 and HCT116 cells. While NF-kappaB involvement was only observed in the HCT116 cells, the cell lines displayed increased NF-kappaB transcriptional activity after exposure to NO.\n",

We report here a highly unusual case of a 61-year old man who had a unique tumor that was composed of a metastatic adenocarcinoma from the stomach to the rectum, which harbored a collision tumor of primary rectal adenocarcinoma. The clonalities of the two histologically distinct lesions of the rectal mass were confirmed by immunohistochemical and molecular analysis. Although histologic examination is the cornerstone in pathology, immunohistochemical and molecular analysis can provide evidence regarding whether tumors originate from the same clone or different clones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of such an occurrence.\n",

We therefore studied methylation in ACF from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or sporadic colorectal cancer. We assessed methylation status of the p16 tumor suppressor gene, MINT1 (methylated in tumor 1), MINT2, MINT31, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene, and hMLH1 mismatch repair gene. We compared methylation to ACF histopathology, K-ras proto-oncogene mutation, loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 1p, and microsatellite instability. Methylation was present in 34% (21 of 61) of ACF, including both FAP and sporadic types, but was more frequent in sporadic ACF [53% (18 of 34) versus 11% (3 of 27), P = 0.002], especially dysplastic sporadic ACF [75% (3 of 4) versus 8% (2 of 24), P = 0.004]. MINT31 was more frequently methylated in heteroplastic ACF than dysplastic ACF [35% (11 of 31) versus 7% (2 of 30), P = 0.01]. Strong associations of ACF methylation with K-ras mutation (P = 0.007) and with loss of chromosome 1p (P = 0.04) were observed, but methylation was the only molecular abnormality identified in 16% (10 of 61) of ACF. Our findings suggest that methylation in ACF is an early event in the pathogenesis of a subset of colorectal carcinomas, and that ACF from FAP patients and patients with sporadic colorectal cancer have distinct epigenetic changes that reflect differences in molecular pathogenesis.\n",

Mutations involving microsatellite-like regions of the type II TGF-beta receptor have been described in subgroups of colorectal cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and distribution of TGF-beta receptors in sporadic colorectal cancers and normal tissues.\n\n## METHODS\nThirty-three sporadic colorectal cancers and 20 normal colonic tissues were explored by immunohistochemistry for the expression of type I and type II TGF-beta receptors. Eighteen tumor and 20 normal samples were used for radioactive thermocycling and sequencing of the two microsatellite-like regions of the type II receptor.\n\n## RESULTS\nBoth receptors were overexpressed in tumors compared with normal samples. There was a relationship between the abundance of type II receptor expression and the degree of differentiation of the tumors but not the Dukes' staging or the localization of the neoplasias. No mutation was observed in the microsatellite-like regions of receptor II in any of the samples.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nSporadic colorectal cancers do not show an absence or a presence of mutated TGF-beta receptors that could explain a resistance to TGF-beta-mediated growth inhibition. The pathways to tumorigenesis of sporadic colorectal cancers may be different from those of some hereditary ones.\n",

Originally identified in bacteria and yeast, the human homologues of DNA mismatch repair genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndromes, as well as a variety of different sporadic cancers. An appreciation of their role in cancer is predicated on an understanding of their function in the processes of DNA repair.

Beclin-1, a key regulator of autophagy formation, has been considered as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Loss of expression or point mutation could serve as a mechanism of loss of beclin-1 tumor suppressor function in cancers. However, our recent study revealed that point mutation of the beclin-1 gene is a rare event in common human cancers. In this study we investigated beclin-1 protein expression in 103 colorectal and 60 gastric carcinoma tissues by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray approach. In the cancers, expression of beclin-1 was detected in 95% of the colorectal carcinomas and 83% of the gastric carcinomas. In contrast, normal mucosal cells of both stomach and colon showed no or very weak expression of beclin-1. There was no significant association of beclin-1 expression with clinocopathologic characteristics, including invasion, metastasis and stage. The beclin-1 expression of colorectal and gastric cancers in the present study is quite in contrast to that of the breast cancers in the previous study, which showed a decreased beclin-1 expression in breast cancer cells compared to normal breast cells. Our data indicate that beclin-1 inactivation by loss of expression may not occur in colorectal and gastric cancers. Rather, increased expression of beclin-1 in the malignant colorectal and gastric epithelial cells compared to their normal mucosal epithelial cells suggests that neo-expression of beclin-1 may play a role in both colorectal and gastric tumorigenesis.\n",

However, its prognostic significance for patients with colorectal cancer remains inconclusive.\n\n## OBJECTIVE\n: To derive a more precise estimation of the prognostic significance of K-ras gene mutations, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed.\n\n## DATA SOURCES\n: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane databases from January 1992 to November 2011.\n\n## STUDY SELECTION\n: The prognostic value of K-ras gene mutations was examined in patients with colorectal cancer who did not receive preoperative chemotherapy or radiation.\n\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\n: The effect of K-ras gene mutations on the overall survival was measured by the HR and 95% CIs.\n\n## RESULTS\n: The pooled HR for the association between K-ras gene mutations and overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.99-1.10, p = 0.11). Subgroup analysis showed significant reductions in the overall survival associated with mutations at K-ras codon 12, the articles that reported HR directly, and the studies published before and after 2005, although publication bias was present. All the associations disappeared after adjustment with the trim-and-fill method. The pooled HR of 3 studies examining mutations at K-ras codon 13 was 1.47 (95% CI: 1.09-1.97, p = 0.02), and no publication bias was observed. No significant association was observed in different study regions.\n\n## LIMITATIONS\n: The heterogeneity in the study populations is a potential problem, the use of different staging systems or small groups of different stages may contribute to heterogeneity, and residual confounding may have influenced the results in those studies that did not completely adjust for other factors.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n: Overall K-ras gene mutations seem not to correlate with the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer. The association remains to be confirmed with a more precise analysis of a large sample.\n",

                "text": "BRCA1 activation of the GADD45 promoter.\n\nBreast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 has been implicated in the control of gene regulation and such regulated genes are thought to mediate the biological role of BRCA1. Overexpression of BRCA1 induces GADD45, a p53-regulated and stress-inducible gene. However, the molecular mechanism by which BRCA1 induces the expression GADD45 remains unclear. In this report, we have shown that the GADD45 promoter is strongly activated following expression of wild-type BRCA1. In contrast, both the tumor-derived BRCA1 mutants (p1749R and Y1853insA) and truncated BRCA1 mutant protein (Delta500 - 1863 BRCA1), which lack transactivation activity, were unable to activate the GADD45 promoter, indicating that the BRCA1-mediated activation of the GADD45 promoter requires normal transcriptional properties of BRCA1. BRCA1 did not induce the c-Jun and c-fos promoters, which rules out a general effect of BRCA1 on other immediate-responsive genes. Expression of the human papillomavirus E6 and the dominant-negative mutant p53 proteins had no effect on the induction of the GADD45 promoter by BRCA1, suggesting that activation of the GADD45 promoter by BRCA1 is independent of cellular p53 function. With the 5'-deletion analysis, the BRCA1-responsive element of the GADD45 promoter was mapped at the region from -121 to -75. Disruption of this region resulted in the abrogation of BRCA1 activation of the GADD45 promoter. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the mechanism by which BRCA1 induces GADD45 is mainly through the transactivation of the GADD45 promoter, further demonstrating the evidence that GADD45 acts as one of the BRCA1-regulated genes.

It is believed that up to 30% of colon cancers and many post-colonoscopy cancers arise from serrated neoplasms. Post-colonoscopy cancers have been found to have a molecular signature similar to SSAs, including CpG island methylation, BRAF mutations, and microsatellite instability. A novel pit pattern, Type II-O, has been demonstrated to have a high specificity for SSAs. Unfortunately, the sensitivity is too low to utilize a Type II-O pit pattern to determine which serrated lesion is neoplastic and needs resection. Moreover, there is significant endoscopist-related variability in the detection of serrated lesions of the colon. Efforts to improve the detection of serrated neoplasms are warranted.\n",

                "text": "Toward new strategies to select young endometrial cancer patients for mismatch repair gene mutation analysis.\n\n\n## PURPOSE\nTo determine the frequency of mismatch repair (MMR) gene germline mutations in endometrial cancer patients who were diagnosed at less than 50 years of age; to relate the presence of mutations to family history, histopathologic data, presence of tumor microsatellite instability (MSI), and immunostaining; and to formulate criteria for genetic testing in these patients.\n\n## PATIENTS AND METHODS\nEndometrial cancer patients (N = 58), who were diagnosed at less than 50 years of age, were included and questioned about their family history. Mutation analysis of the MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 genes was performed (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis to detect small mutations and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to detect large deletions or duplications). For MSI analysis, five consensus markers were used, and immunostaining of the three MMR proteins was performed.\n\n## RESULTS\nIn five of 22 patients with a positive first-degree family history for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)-related cancers, pathogenic germline mutations were found (one MLH1, three MSH2, and one MSH6). Four mutation carriers belonged to families fulfilling the revised Amsterdam criteria. No mutations were found in the 35 patients without such family history (P =.006). MSI was detected in 20 of 57 cancers, among which four were from mutation carriers. In 23 of 51 cancers, one or more MMR protein was absent; in all five mutation carriers, immunostaining indicated the involved MMR gene.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nIn 23% of the young endometrial cancer patients with at least one first-degree relative with an HNPCC-related cancer, an MMR gene mutation was detected. Therefore, presence of an HNPCC-related cancer in a first-degree relative seems to be an important selection criterion for mutation analysis. Subsequent immunostaining of MMR proteins will point to the gene(s) that should be analyzed.\n",

Such tumors have been thought to manifest replication errors (RER+), but the basis for the alterations has remained conjectural. We demonstrate that the mutation rate of (CA)n repeats in RER+ tumor cells is at least 100-fold that in RER- tumor cells and show by in vitro assay that increased mutability of RER+ cells is associated with a profound defect in strand-specific mismatch repair. This deficiency was observed with microsatellite heteroduplexes as well as with heteroduplexes containing single base-base mismatches and affected an early step in the repair pathway. Thus, a true mutator phenotype exists in a subset of tumor cells, the responsible defect is likely to cause transitions and transversions in addition to microsatellite alterations, and a biochemical basis for this phenotype has been identified.\n",

                "text": "Mismatch repair genes in renal cortical neoplasms.\n\nMutation of human mutL homolog 1 (MLH-1) and human mutS homolog 2 (MSH-2) has been linked with the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome and other carcinomas. Mutations of these genes in renal cell carcinomas were recently described. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of MLH-1 and MSH-2 in renal cortical neoplasms of various histological types by immunohistochemistry. Thirty-eight (n = 38) resected renal tumors were obtained from the surgical pathology files of the UMass Memorial Healthcare, including clear cell carcinomas (CLEARs, n = 20), papillary carcinomas (PAPs, n = 8), chromophobe carcinomas (CHRs, n = 4), and oncocytomas (ONCs, n = 6). Positive immunostaining for MLH-1 and MSH-2 was graded by the number of positive tumor cell nuclei, as follows: 0, negative; 1, up to one third of positive nuclei; 2, one to two thirds positive; and 3, greater than two thirds positive. Loss of MLH-1 or MSH-2 was defined as a tumor with grade 0 or 1, compared with the normal tubules. Normal tubules and intercalated ducts contained cells positive for MLH-1 and MSH-2 in all cases. For both antibodies, positive staining in tumors ranged from grade 1 to 3 in the CLEAR and PAP but was only grade 2 to 3 in the CHR and ONC. Loss of MLH-1 and/or MSH-2 occurred in malignant tumors but not in ONC. Loss of MLH-1 was present in 8 (40%) of 20 CLEARs and 4 (50%) of 8 PAPs, compared with loss of MSH-2 in 4 (20%) of 20 CLEARs and 1 (25%) of 4 CHRs. Our results suggest that loss of mismatch repair genes is involved in the malignant transformation in some renal carcinomas, particularly those derived from the proximal tubules.\n",

We conducted a longitudinal study of 208 participants (62 LS mutation carriers and 146 non-carriers) who provided information on general anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), fear of cancer and dying, satisfaction with life, risk and test perceptions, and surveillance behaviour in the baseline questionnaire before testing, and 1 month, 1 year and 7 years post-test. At 7 years, most of the psychosocial variables remained unchanged, regardless of mutation status. Carriers tended to underestimate their colorectal cancer risk but were more worried about their cancer risk than their counterparts. Non-carriers reported a higher degree of satisfaction with their testing decisions (P < 0.05), but had more doubts concerning test result validity than carriers (P < 0.05). All carriers attended a post-test colonoscopy surveillance, while 16% of non-carriers reported colonoscopy examinations. Those non-carriers with doubts about test validity were more likely (P = 0.019) to report post-test colonoscopy. Of the carriers, 17% had an interval longer than 3 years between their colonoscopies. Fear of dying soon, measured at 1-month post-test follow-up was the only psychosocial variable predicting non-compliance in recommended surveillance. No adverse psychosocial consequences were detected, and respondents were satisfied with their decision to testing 7 years post-test. Among the carriers, solely fear of dying soon predicted non-compliance in recommended surveillance. Some non-carriers were still worried about their risk and had doubts about the validity of their genetic testing results predicting post-test colonoscopy.\n",

Biallelic pathogenic MUTYH variants have been associated with colorectal polyposis and cancer. The pathogenicity of a few variants is beyond doubt, including c.536A4G/p.Tyr179Cys and c.1187G4A/p.Gly396Asp (previously c.494A4G/p.Tyr165Cys and c.1145G4A/p.Gly382Asp).However, for a substantial fraction of the detected variants, the clinical significance remains uncertain,compromising molecular diagnostics and thereby genetic counseling. We have established an interactive MUTYH gene sequence variant database (www.lovd.nl/MUTYH) with the aim of collecting and sharing MUTYH genotype and phenotype data worldwide. To support standard variant description, we chose NM_001128425.1 as the reference sequence. The database includes records with variants per individual, linked to available phenotype and geographic origin data as well as records with in vitro functional and in silico test data. As of April 2010, the database contains 1968 published and 423 unpublished submitted entries, and 230 and 61 unique variants,respectively. This open-access repository allows all involved to quickly share all variants encountered and communicate potential consequences, which will be especially useful to classify variants of uncertain significance.\n",

Based on its interaction with the MutL homologue MLH1, it was postulated that MLH3 might play a role in tumorigenesis. Germ line and somatic mutations in MLH3 have been identified in a small fraction of colorectal cancers, but the role of MLH3 in colorectal cancer tumorigenesis remains controversial. We investigated MLH3's role in endometrial tumorigenesis through analysis of tumor and germ line DNA from 57 endometrial cancer patients who were at increased risk for having inherited cancer susceptibility. Patients with known MSH2 or MSH6 mutations were excluded as well as those who had MLH1-methylated tumors. Sixteen different variants were identified by single-strand conformational variant analysis. Of the 12 missense changes identified, three were somatic mutations. One patient had a germ line missense variant and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in her tumor specimen. There was no evidence of MLH3 promoter methylation based on combined bisulfite restriction analysis. The identification of inherited missense variants, somatic missense mutations (present in 3 of 57 tumors), and LOH in the tumor from a patient with a germ line missense change suggest a role for MLH3 in endometrial tumorigenesis.\n",

This has been facilitated and catalyzed by an appreciation and deep understanding of the forms of colorectal cancer that harbor an inherited predisposition, including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch syndrome, the hamartomatous polyposis syndromes, and certain other rare syndromes. Identification of germline mutations in pivotal genes underlying the inherited forms of colorectal cancer has yielded many dividends, including functional dissection of critical molecular pathways that have been revealed to be important in development, cellular homeostasis, and cancer; new approaches in chemoprevention, molecular diagnostics and genetic testing, and therapy; and underscoring genotypic-phenotypic relationships.\n",

Its plasma level is normally low but 4G/4G homozygotes have higher concentrations of PAI 1. This genotype may be associated with worse prognosis and proximal location of colorectal cancer than 5G/5G homozygotes. In our prospective evaluation we examined plasma level PAI 1 (using photometric microplate method ELISA) pre-surgery and, subsequently, 6-8 weeks later, from 80 patients. For the PAI 1 rs1799889 -675 4G/5G polymorphism test the PCR amplification was used.Analysis of collected data was confirmed that significantly higher plasma levels of PAI 1 were found in patients before starting therapy, which decreased (p=0.004) after initiation of treatment. Patients with higher plasma level PAI 1 before (p=0.013) and after therapy (p=0.004) had significantly shorter survival. We found no relationship between polymorphisms of PAI 1 (-675 4G/5G) in relation to stage, survival or tumor location. PAI 1 is useful as a negative marker of prognosis and could be advantageous when planning adjuvant treatment of patients with colorectal carcinoma. Although opinions on the importance of polymorphisms of PAI 1 in relation to the prognosis are not uniform, it does seem that their role in the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer is not essential.\n",

In our study, we have investigated the methylation status of four PTPRs: PTPRM, PTPRT, PTPRR and PTPRZ1, which were pre-selected using microarray techniques as being alternatively methylated in sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). The analyses were carried out on 131 surgical specimens obtained from sporadic CRC patients. The methylation status of the four genes was examined using methyl specific PCR (MSP). The analysis of promoter methylation using an Illumina 27K microarray revealed four protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPRM, PTPRT, PTPRR and PTPRZ1 as being hypermethylated with \u03b2-value \u22650.2 and P\u22640.05. Subsequent analysis using MSP confirmed these observations-the frequency of promoter methylation was significantly higher in tumor cells compared with matched normal tissue for each of the analyzed genes. There was no association observed between the methylation status of PTPRs and either CIMP, K-ras (codon 12) and BRAF (exon 15, V600E) mutations or tumor localization (proximal/distal). The results of our study show a statistically significant difference between promoter methylation in cancerous and healthy tissue. This result supports the hypothesis that the PTPR family has an important role in the etiology of CRC.\n",

The independent association between BRAF mutation status and CRC survival, however, remains unclear.\n\n## METHODS\nWe evaluated the association between the BRAF c.1799T>A (p.V600E) mutation and survival in individuals with incident invasive CRC diagnosed between 1997 and 2007 in Western Washington State. Tumor specimens were tested for this BRAF mutation and MSI status. We used Cox regression to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between BRAF mutation status and disease-specific and overall survival. Stratified analyses were conducted by age, sex, tumor site, stage, and MSI status.\n\n## RESULTS\nAmong 1,980 cases tested, 12% were BRAF c.1799T>A (p.V600E) mutation-positive (n = 247). BRAF-mutated CRC was associated with poorer disease-specific survival adjusting for age, sex, time from diagnosis to enrollment, stage, and MSI status (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.95). This association was limited to cases diagnosed at ages <50 (HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.70-5.52) and was not evident in cases with MSI-high tumors (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.44-2.03). Associations with overall survival were similar.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur results show that the prevalence of BRAF mutations in CRC differs by patient and tumor characteristics and suggest that the association between BRAF status and CRC survival may differ by some of these factors.\n\n## IMPACT\nThe presence of a BRAF c.1799T>A (p.V600E) mutation is associated with significantly poorer prognosis after CRC diagnosis among subgroups of patients.\n",

We examine variation in the CYP19A1 gene and risk of colorectal cancer using data from population-based case-control studies (colon n = 1,574 cases, 1,970 controls; rectal n = 791 cases, 999 controls). Four SNPs were statistically significantly associated with colon cancer and four were associated with rectal cancer. After adjustment for multiple comparisons, the AA genotype of rs12591359 was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer (OR 1.44 95% CI 1.16-1.80) and the AA genotype of rs2470144 was associated with a reduced risk of rectal cancer (OR 0.65 95% CI 0.50-0.84). Variants of CYP19A1 were associated with CIMP+ and CIMP+/KRAS2-mutated tumors. CT/TT genotypes of rs1961177 were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of a MSI+ colon tumor (OR 1.77 95% CI 1.26-2.37). We observed statistically significant interactions between genetic variation in NF\u03baB1 and CYP19A1 for both colon and rectal cancer. Our data suggest the importance of CYP19A1 in the development of colon and rectal cancer and that estrogen may influence risk through an inflammation-related mechanism.\n",

The carriers of these diseases from early childhood are at risk for neoplasias at different sites, which are symptomatic at various ages.\n\n## AIM\nto study the clinical organ-specific manifestations in patients with FAP and Peutz-Jeghers, genetics update and possibilities of diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of these diseases.\n\n## MATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe authors give the results of their examination and follow-up of children with FAP and Peutz-Jeghers hamartoma-polypous syndrome. In addition, current data from PubMed, Medline (including reviews, original articles and case reports) were used.\n\n## RESULTS\nThe main clinical organ-specific signs of multiple tumors in FAP and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are shown. Data on the assessment of a risk for malignant tumors at various sites in the affected patients and their family members at different ages are provided. Each of these syndromes has a dissimilar genetic foundation. FAP is caused by the germline mutations in the APC gene, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is by the STK11 gene, which predispose individuals to specifically associated neoplasias and require different follow-up strategies. Information on a phenotype-genotype correlation may serve as a reference point for the possible severity and various manifestations of a disease. An update on the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases is considered.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nMolecular genetic testing of the genes associated with FAP and Peutz-Jeghers syndromes makes it possible to timely recognize family members at high risk, to plan therapeutic strategy and to affect the course of a disease. The joint participation of pediatricians, proctologists, oncologists, morphologists, geneticists, and molecular biologists is essential to timely recognize the carriers of the syndromes and a better prognosis in these patients.\n",

                "text": "Instability at the FRA8I common fragile site disrupts the genomic integrity of the KIAA0146, CEBPD and PRKDC genes in colorectal cancer.\n\nSpecific patterns of genomic aberrations have been associated with different types of malignancies. In colorectal cancer, losses of chromosome arm 8p and gains of chromosome arm 8q are among the most common chromosomal rearrangements, suggesting that the centromeric portion of chromosome 8 is particularly sensitive to breakage. Genomic alterations frequently occur in the early stages of tumorigenesis at specific genomic regions known as common fragile sites (cFSs). CFSs represent parts of the normal chromosome structure that are prone to breakage under replication stress. In this study, we identified the genomic location of FRA8I, spanning 530 kb at 8q11.21 and assessed the composition of the fragile DNA sequence. FRA8I encompasses KIAA0146, a large protein-coding gene with yet unknown function, as well as CEBPD and part of PRKDC, two genes encoding proteins involved in tumorigenesis in a variety of cancers. We show that FRA8I is unstable in lymphocytes and epithelial cells, displaying similar expression rates. We examined copy number alteration patterns within FRA8I in a panel of 25 colorectal cancer cell lines and surveyed publically available profiles of 56 additional colorectal cancer cell lines. Combining these data shows that focal recombination events disrupt the genomic integrity of KIAA0146 and neighboring cFS genes in 12.3% of colorectal cancer cell lines. Moreover, data analysis revealed evidence that KIAA0146 is a translocation partner of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene in recurrent t(8;14)(q11;q32) translocations in a subset of patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our data molecularly describe a region of enhanced chromosomal instability in the human genome and point to a role of the KIAA0146 gene in tumorigenesis.\n",

                "text": "Impact of Cellular Genetic Make-up on Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines Response to Ellagic Acid: Implications of Small Interfering RNA.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\nK-Ras activation is an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis and associated mutations have been reported in about 40% of colorectal cancer patients. These mutations have always been responsible for enhancing malignancy and silencing them is associated with attenuation of tumorigenicity. Among downstream effectors are the RAF/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. PI3K/Akt signaling leads to reduction of apoptosis, stimulated cell growth and enhanced proliferation. Ellagic acid (EA), a naturally occurring antioxidant, has recently emerged as a promising anti-cancer agent.\n\n## PURPOSE\nTo evaluate the impact of cellular genetic make- up of two colon cancer cell lines with different genetic backgrounds, HCT-116 (K-Ras-/p53+) and Caco-2 (K-Ras+/ p53-), on response to potential anti-tumour effects of EA. In addition, the influence of K-Ras silencing in HCT- 116 cells was investigated.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nCellular proliferation, morphology and cell cycle analysis were carried out in addition to Western blotting for detecting total Akt and p-Akt (at Thr308 and Ser473) in the presence and absence of different concentrations of EA. Cell proliferation was also assessed in cells transfected with different concentrations of K-Ras siRNA or incubated with ellagic acid following transfection.\n\n## RESULTS\nThe results of the present study revealed that EA exerts anti-proliferative and dose-dependent pro-apoptotic effects. Cytostatic and cytotoxic effects were also observed. p-Akt (at Thr308 and Ser473) was downregulated. Moreover, EA treatment was found to (i) reduce K-Ras protein expression; (ii) in cells transfected with siRNA and co-treated with EA, pronounced anti-proliferative effects as well as depletion of p-Akt (at Thr308) were detected.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCellular genetic makeup (K-Ras-/p53-) was not likely to impose limitations on targeting EA in treatment of colon cancer. EA had a multi-disciplinary pro-apoptotic anti-proliferative approach, having inhibited Akt phosphorylation, induced cell cycle arrest and showed an anti-proliferative potential in HCT-116 cells (expressing mutant K-Ras).\n",

The purpose of this study was to characterize multiple molecular genetic alterations in sporadic colon carcinoma and to correlate them with the location of the tumors and with lymph node metastasis.\n\n## METHODS\nOne hundred and twenty-five cases of sporadic colon carcinoma (50 in the right colon and 75 in the left colon in patients with no family history of colon carcinoma) were studied. Status of the p53 gene was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single strand conformation polymorphism, and sequencing at exons 5-8. Microsatellite instability was analyzed with five microsatellite markers at chromosome 18. The mismatch repair genes hMLH1 and hMSH2 were studied in tumors found to have microsatellite instability by PCR and sequencing.\n\n## RESULTS\nIn the 125 cases studied, there were 53 tumors with mutations of the p53 gene. p53 mutations correlated with lymph node metastases from right colon carcinoma cases (61%), and all cases with p53 mutations and microsatellite instability were AJCC/UICC Stage III (Dukes Stage C). In the right colon carcinoma cases the rate of microsatellite instability was related to the tumor size (19% in tumors measuring < 4 cm, and 34% in tumors measuring > 4 cm). No correlation between microsatellite instability and p53 mutations was detected. In the left colon carcinoma cases, p53 mutations were detected in 41% of tumors and microsatellite instability in 14%; neither finding was related to the tumor size. Mutations of the hMLH1 and hMSH2 mismatch repair genes were detected in 7 of 24 cases with marked microsatellite instability.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nMicrosatellite instability is prone to occur in sporadic right colon carcinoma during tumor growth and is not associated significantly with mutations in the hMLH1 and hMSH2 mismatch repair genes or in the p53 gene. Concomitant detection of microsatellite instability and p53 mutations in right colon carcinoma is associated with the presence of lymph node metastases.\n",

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by the presence of multiple adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum. The gene responsible for FAP (APC) was cloned in 1991. Extensive analyses of the mutation spectra in FAP kindreds have been performed in different countries, but the results have been highly variable (30-80%). In this study, we used denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) followed by automatic sequencing in an effort to establish the mutation spectrum of APC from DNA of peripheral blood cells. Among the 6 FAP probands analyzed, mutations were detected in 3 (50%), 2 of which were novel. The first novel mutation was at codon 2166, with a C to T transition, resulting in a stop codon. The second novel mutation was at codon 1971, with a C to G transversion, resulting in an amino acid change from serine to cysteine. The third mutation involved an A insertion in the sequence of -AAAAAA- at codons 1554-1556, which created a downstream stop codon (codon 1558). This study is the first to report mutation analysis in Taiwanese FAP probands.\n",

It is characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI) related to mutations of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The role of the pathologist in the detection of colorectal cancer with MSI phenotype is important. Among the available tests to detect MSI, immunohistochemistry appears being a sensitive, specific and inexpensive test. The detection of HNPCC syndrome by the genetic test among the MSI cancers implies a coordination of the structures of health and requires a follow-up of the patients, during and after the genetic test. Ethical dimension related to these hereditary cancers must be considered without constituting a brake for their detection.\n",

Here, frequencies, linkage disequilibrium and phenotypic consequences of six SNPs are described.\n\n## METHODS\nFrom genomic DNA, 114 British Caucasians (49 colorectal cancer cases and 65 controls) were genotyped for the CYP1A2 polymorphisms -3858G-->A (allele CYP1A2*1C), -2464T-->delT (CYP1A2*1D), -740T-->G (CYP1A2*1E and *1G), -164A-->C (CYP1A2*1F), 63C-->G (CYP1A2*2), and 1545T-->C (alleles CYP1A2*1B, *1G, *1H and *3), using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. All patients and controls were phenotyped for CYP1A2 by h.p.l.c. analysis of urinary caffeine metabolites.\n\n## RESULTS\nIn 114 samples, the most frequent CYP1A2 SNPs were 1545T-->C (38.2% of tested chromosomes), -164A-->C (CYP1A2*1F, 33.3%) and -2464T-->delT (CYP1A2*1D, 4.82%). The SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium: the most frequent constellations were found to be -3858G/-2464T/-740T/-164A/63C/1545T (61.8%), -3858G/-2464T/-740T/-164C/63C/1545C (33.3%), and -3858G/-2464delT/-740T/-164A/63C/1545C (3.51%), with no significant frequency differences between cases and controls. In the phenotype analysis, lower caffeine metabolic ratios were detected in cases than in controls. This was significant in smokers (n = 14, P = 0.020), and in a subgroup of 15 matched case-control pairs (P = 0.007), but it was not significant in nonsmokers (n = 100, P = 0.39). There was no detectable association between CYP1A2 genotype and caffeine phenotype.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n(i) CYP1A2 polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium. Therefore, only -164A-->C (CYP1A2*1F) and -2464T-->delT (CYP1A2*1D) need to be analysed in the routine assessment of CYP1A2 genotype; (ii) in vivo CYP1A2 activity is lower in colorectal cancer patients than in controls, and (iii) CYP1A2 genotype had no effect on phenotype (based on the caffeine metabolite ratio). However, this remains to be confirmed in a larger study.\n",

                "text": "Characteristics of somatic mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene in colorectal tumors.\n\nMutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene was analyzed in 500 colorectal tumors from 70 familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and 102 non-FAP patients and in normal tissues from 119 FAP patients, using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing methods. These tumors were histopathologically diagnosed. Sixty-eight germ line mutations (62% deletion, 9% insertion, and 29% single-base substitution) and 241 somatic mutations (56% deletion, 12% insertion, and 32% single-base substitution) were detected. All mutations formed stop codons resulting in truncated APC proteins, except for one germ line mutation. Differences were found between somatic and germ line mutations, including 3 new hot spots of mutation at codons 1378, 1450, and 1487-1490, which frequently occurred in somatic mutations but not in germ lines. The frequency of mutation in each histopathological type of FAP tumor was 53% in moderate adenoma, 64% in severe adenoma, 52% in intramucosal carcinoma, and 33% in invasive carcinoma, whereas the loss of heterozygosity including the APC gene increased with development to each histopathological type. A similar tendency was observed in non-FAP tumors. Additionally, we found 10 FAP tumors that had both somatic mutation and loss of heterozygosity. These tumors were assumed to have developed from moderate adenomas with germ line and somatic mutations, followed by deletion of the allele with germ line mutation. These results suggest that inactivation of the APC gene by two mutations is involved in the development of moderate adenoma, and loss of heterozygosity of the APC gene is associated with further development to carcinoma. It was also observed that the distribution of 75 somatic mutations from one FAP patient on the APC sequence was similar to the distribution of 159 somatic mutations from 83 patients with FAP and non-FAP, which suggests that the position of somatic mutation is mostly due to the APC sequence itself.\n",

We assessed the association between polymorphisms in two genes involved in DNA repair of oxidative stress, GPX and OGG1, and risk of colorectal carcinoma or adenomas. We studied 166 cases with adenocarcinoma, 974 with adenomas and 397 controls recruited from the Norwegian cohort NORCCAP. No associations were found between the polymorphism GPX Pro198Leu and risk of colorectal adenomas or carcinomas. Carriers of the variant allele OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism had a lowered risk of colorectal cancer, OR=0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.33-0.95), while no association were found with risk of adenomas. This indicates that a low repair capacity of oxidative DNA damage may not be a risk factor for development of colorectal adenomas or carcinoma.\n",

The application calculated the risk of BRCA mutations using BRCAPRO, Myriad and Tyrer-Cuzick risk assessment models. Lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer was assessed with the BRCAPRO, Claus and Tyrer-Cuzick models. Colorectal and endometrial cancer risk was calculated via the MMRpro model. Patients were identified as high-risk based on thresholds 10% or greater risk for carrying genetic mutations or 20% or greater lifetime risk of breast or ovarian cancer. The percent of women found to be high-risk by a single risk assessment tool ranged from 0.5 to 5.3%. Combining assessment tools found 9.3% of women to be high-risk. The risk assessments performed similarly for the mammography and ultrasound cohorts with yields (combining assessment tools) of 9.2 and 9.4% respectively. The average ages of all the high-risk women were 45.8 and 39.6 years for the mammography and ultrasound cohorts respectively. Difficulties encountered included a need for software upgrade, wireless network unreliability and hardware theft. Automated family history screening can identify women probably at high-risk for hereditary cancers efficiently. The number of women identified is increased by employing multiple risk assessment models simultaneously. Surveying women in conjunction with ultrasound identified women at increased risk as effectively and at a younger age than with screening mammography.\n",

                "text": "BRAF mutation is frequently present in sporadic colorectal cancer with methylated hMLH1, but not in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.\n\n\n## PURPOSE\nThe BRAF gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase and plays an important role in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. BRAF mutations in sporadic colorectal cancer with microsatellite instability (MSI) are more frequently detected than those in microsatellite stable cancer. In this study, we sought to compare the frequencies of BRAF mutations in sporadic colorectal cancer with MSI with those in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nWe analyzed BRAF mutations in 26 colorectal cancer cell lines, 80 sporadic colorectal cancers, and 20 tumors from HNPCC patients by DNA sequencing and sequence-specific PCR. The methylation status of the hMLH1 gene was measured by either sequencing or restriction enzyme digestion after NaHSO(3) treatment.\n\n## RESULTS\nWe observed a strong correlation of BRAF mutation with hMLH1 promoter methylation. BRAF mutations were present in 13 of 15 (87%) of the colorectal cell lines and cancers with methylated hMLH1, whereas only 4 of 91 (4%) of the cell lines and cancers with unmethylated hMLH1 carried the mutations (P < 0.00001). Sixteen of 17 mutations were at residue 599 (V599E). A BRAF mutation was also identified at residue 463 (G463V) in one cell line. In addition, BRAF mutations were not found in any cancers or cell lines with K-ras mutations. In 20 MSI+ cancers from HNPCC patients, however, BRAF mutations were not detectable, including a subset of 9 tumors with negative hMLH1 immunostaining and methylated hMLH1.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBRAF mutations are frequently present in sporadic colorectal cancer with methylated hMLH1, but not in HNPCC-related cancers. This discrepancy of BRAF mutations between sporadic MSI+ cancer and HNPCC might be used in a strategy for the detection of HNPCC families.\n",

We found amplification and enhanced expression of the cellular oncogene c-myc in both COLO 320 DM and HSR cells, and we were able to show that the homogeneously staining regions of the COLO 320 HSR marker chromosome contain amplified c-myc. From previous and present karyotypes, it appears that the homogeneously staining regions reside on a distorted X chromosome. Therefore, amplification of c-myc has been accompanied by translocation of the gene from its normal position on chromosome 8 (8q24). Because double minute chromosomes were features of primary cultures from the original tumor, it seems reasonable to suspect that amplification of c-myc may have contributed to tumorigenesis.\n",

                "text": "Oncogenic KRAS is not necessary for Wnt signalling activation in APC-associated FAP adenomas.\n\nRecent studies have suggested that APC loss alone may be insufficient to promote aberrant Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Our aim was to comprehensively characterize Wnt signalling components in a set of APC-associated familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) tumours. Sixty adenomas from six FAP patients with known pathogenic APC mutations were included. Somatic APC and KRAS mutations, beta-catenin immunostaining, and qRT-PCR of APC, MYC, AXIN2 and SFRP1 were analysed. Array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was also assessed in 26 FAP adenomas and 24 paired adenoma-carcinoma samples. A somatic APC alteration was present in 15 adenomas (LOH in 11 and four point mutations). KRAS mutations were detected in 10% of the cases. APC mRNA was overexpressed in adenomas. MYC and AXIN2 were also overexpressed, with significant intra-case heterogeneity. Increased cytoplasmic and/or nuclear beta-catenin staining was seen in 94% and 80% of the adenomas. beta-Catenin nuclear staining was strongly associated with MYC levels (p value 0.03) but not with KRAS mutations. Copy number aberrations were rare. However, the recurrent chromosome changes observed more frequently contained Wnt pathway genes (p value 0.012). Based on beta-catenin staining and Wnt pathway target genes alterations the Wnt pathway appears to be constitutively activated in all APC-FAP tumours, with alterations occurring both upstream and downstream of APC. Wnt aberrations are present at both the DNA and the RNA level. Somatic profiling of APC-FAP tumours provides new insights into the role of APC in tumourigenesis.\n",

Lynch syndrome patients are predisposed to different cancers in a non-random fashion, the basis of which is poorly understood. We addressed this issue by determining the molecular profiles for different tumors from a nationwide cohort of Lynch syndrome families (approximately 150 tumors in total). We focused on some less prevalent cancers, affecting the brain (n = 7) and urinary tract (five bladder and five ureter uroepithelial cancers and four kidney adenocarcinomas), and compared their molecular characteristics to those of the most common cancers, colorectal, gastric and endometrial adenocarcinomas, from the same families. Despite origin from verified MMR gene mutation carriers, the frequency of high-level microsatellite instability in tumors varied between high (100-96% for ureter, stomach and colon), intermediate (63-60% for endometrium and bladder) and low (25-0% for kidney and brain). In contrast to gastrointestinal and endometrial carcinomas, active (nuclear) beta-catenin was rare and KRAS mutations were absent in brain and urological tumors. Compared with other tumors, frequent stabilization of p53 protein characterized urinary tract cancers. Promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes discriminated the tumors in an organ-specific manner. Our findings suggest that different Lynch syndrome tumors develop along different routes. Uroepithelial cancers of the ureter (and bladder to lesser extent) share many characteristics of MMR deficiency-driven tumorigenesis, whereas brain tumors and kidney adenocarcinomas follow separate pathways.\n",

First, we show that DOC induces a statistically significant fourfold increase in the number of micronuclei in NCM-460 cells (a noncancerous colon cell line) and a threefold increase in the number of micronuclei in binucleated HT-29 colon cancer cells using the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay. Second, we observed mitotic aberrations after DOC treatment, including improper alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate, lagging chromosomes during anaphase, anaphase/telophase chromatin bridges, multipolar divisions, and formation of polynucleated cells. It was determined that there was a statistically significant threefold increase in the number of aberrant metaphases after short-term and long-term exposure of HT-29 and HCT-116 cells, respectively. Third, we showed with Western blots and immunohistochemistry that a likely basis for these mitosis-related perturbations included decreased expression of the spindle checkpoint proteins, Mad2, BubR1, and securin. Fourth, results of DOC treatment on nocodazole-challenged cells further indicated deficiencies in activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. This study provides mechanisms by which hydrophobic bile acids can induce genomic instability in colon epithelial cells.\n",

DNA was extracted with a genomic DNA miniprep kit. Then PCR was performed with the designed primers and the product directly sequenced by the Sanger method. Then the associations between K-ras mutation status and clinicopathological characteristics in colorectal cancer were analyzed.\n\n## RESULTS\nOf 208 cases, 91 cases of K-ras gene mutation were detected. The 12 or 13 codon had a mutation rate of 43.8%. There were no significant differences in gender, tumor location, histopathological grading and Duke's stage between the wild and mutated groups.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nDetection of K-ras gene status in colorectal cancer will help to select the patients likely to benefit from the monoclonal antibody therapy of targeting epidermal growth factor receptor.\n",

His mother and younger brother both had subcutaneous soft tissue tumors in the back and sparse-type colorectal polyposis. His mother also had dental anomalies and gastric fundic gland polyposis. The patient was admitted to our hospital for investigation of bloody stools. Barium enema and colonofiberscopy revealed advanced rectal cancer and sparse (<50) colorectal polyps. He also had dental anomalies, a subcutaneous soft tissue tumor in the back, and gastric fundic gland polyposis as extracolonic manifestations. A total proctocolectomy and ileoanal anastomosis were performed, and histological examination of the resected specimens confirmed moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas of the rectum with metastases to the regional lymph nodes. The other colorectal polyps were tubular adenomas with no evidence of malignancy. Germline mutations in the APC gene were observed in codons 486, 545, 1493, and 1556. This case serves to demonstrate that a total proctocolectomy with ileoanal anastomosis should be the procedure of choice for young patients found to have advanced rectal cancer associated with FAP.\n",

We assessed the association of 24 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in 13 genes in the one-carbon metabolism pathway and risk of colorectal adenoma in 556 incident cases and 557 controls nested in the Nurses' Health Study. Most of the SNPs were not associated with risk of colorectal adenoma. We did, however, observe a modest increased risk among carriers of the transcobalamin (TCN) II 259 Pro/Arg + Arg/Arg variant (odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.09-2.02) for colorectal adenoma. The TCN II Pro259Arg polymorphism may affect TCN binding and transport of vitamin B(12) and thus warrants further investigation of its biological function. In addition, the methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) Arg415Cys and MTRR Ser284Thr variant carriers, also in the vitamin B(12) pathway, have suggestive associations with advanced colorectal adenoma (defined as being larger than 1 cm, villous, tubular-villous or carcinoma in situ histology). We observed significant evidence for departure from multiplicative interaction for the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) Arg239Gln with dietary methyl status (based on intake of dietary folate, methionine and alcohol intake) in relation to colorectal adenoma; no such interaction was observed for the other 23 SNPs. Further investigation is required to validate the association of the polymorphisms in the one-carbon metabolic genes and risk of colorectal adenoma.\n",

The presence of characteristic hypertrophic retinal lesions has been advocated as useful biomarkers for FAP. We have compared molecular linkage and retinal screening techniques by evaluating the presymptomatic carrier risk of 40 at-risk individuals from 15 FAP families. Linkage analysis was informative in all and retinal lesion analysis in 25 cases. For informative at-risk population, predictive diagnosis by both techniques was completely concordant and identified 15 members at \"high\" and 10 at \"low\" risk of inheriting FAP. Because of the unique advantages offered by each technique, a strategy integrating both techniques will increase the number of FAP families that can be screened presymptomatically. Identification of individuals at high risk of polyposis will improve their clinical surveillance and further reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer in FAP families.\n",

The mean age at diagnosis for CRC is about 70 years. Time of disease onset 20 years younger than the mean age is assumed to be indicative of genetic susceptibility. We have compared high resolution tumor genome copy number variation (CNV) (Roche NimbleGen, 385 000 oligo CGH array) in microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors from two age groups, including 23 young at onset patients without known hereditary syndromes and with a median age of 44 years (range: 28-53) and 17 elderly patients with median age 79 years (range: 69-87). Our aim was to identify differences in the tumor genomes between these groups and pinpoint potential susceptibility loci. Integration analysis of CNV and genome wide mRNA expression data, available for the same tumors, was performed to identify a restricted candidate gene list.\n\n## RESULTS\nThe total fraction of the genome with aberrant copy number, the overall genomic profile and the TP53 mutation spectrum were similar between the two age groups. However, both the number of chromosomal aberrations and the number of breakpoints differed significantly between the groups. Gains of 2q35, 10q21.3-22.1, 10q22.3 and 19q13.2-13.31 and losses from 1p31.3, 1q21.1, 2q21.2, 4p16.1-q28.3, 10p11.1 and 19p12, positions that in total contain more than 500 genes, were found significantly more often in the early onset group as compared to the late onset group. Integration analysis revealed a covariation of DNA copy number at these sites and mRNA expression for 107 of the genes. Seven of these genes, CLC, EIF4E, LTBP4, PLA2G12A, PPAT, RG9MTD2, and ZNF574, had significantly different mRNA expression comparing median expression levels across the transcriptome between the two groups.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTen genomic loci, containing more than 500 protein coding genes, are identified as more often altered in tumors from early onset versus late onset CRC. Integration of genome and transcriptome data identifies seven novel candidate genes with the potential to identify an increased risk for CRC.\n",

Although mutations of the p53 gene have been shown to be frequent, the protein was present in only approximately 50 percent of specimens examined. However only one monoclonal antibody recognizing an epitope present on wild-type p53 had been used. We studied the p53 expression in a series of 16 colorectal carcinoma specimens using 3 different monoclonal antibodies (pAb 421, 1801, 240). Specific immunofluorescent staining was quantified by dual parameter (DNA/p53) flow cytometry. Two different types of preparations were compared in order to verify the conservation of the antigen. Nuclear suspensions prepared from frozen tumor fragments were shown to produce results equivalent to those of whole cell preparations originating from fresh surgical specimens. The p53 protein was detected in 9 of the 16 cancers with pAb 421 and 240 monoclonal antibodies (8 of which were also positive for pAb 1801 antibody). Four additional tumors were considered positive for pAb 240 antibody alone. Overall, 13/16 cancer specimens were shown to present immunoreactivity for pAb 240 antibody. Topography of staining was investigated by immunohistochemistry with peroxidase methods. Eight cases were informative, 6 of which presented nuclear staining compatible with the cytometry results. There was one discordant case i.e. pAb 240 antibody being positive on cytometry and entirely negative on immunohistochemistry. This small series allowed us to show that 81 percent of tumor samples stained with monoclonal antibody pAb 240, considered to be specific to mutated protein, and that some tumors express a p53 protein which is not detected with terminal sequence-specific antibodies.\n",

One explanation is the role of modifying genes that can either promote or prevent disease development on a background of increased risk. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in MDM2 and TP53 have been shown to be associated with younger ages of disease onset in HNPCC (TP53) and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (MDM2). In this study 220 HNPCC patients were examined, from Australia and Poland, all characterized at the molecular level to determine the frequency of the MDM2 SNP309 T>G and to assess its influence on disease expression. The results were then pooled with the results of a previous study to assess the combined influence of the MDM2 SNP309 T>G and TP53 SNP R72P. A significant difference was observed between CRC patients and unaffected MMR gene mutation carriers over the age of 45 years (p = 0.01). The unaffected MMR gene mutation carriers over the age of 45 years who carry the G allele have a reduced risk of developing CRC. The results indicate that the MDM2 SNP309, alone or in combination with TP53 R72P, does not influence age of diagnosis of CRC in individuals with HNPCC. In conclusion, the data indicates the G allele of MDM2 SNP309 might have a protective effect on disease development in HNPCC patients and that age of diagnosis of CRC is not associated with MDM2 SNP309 or TP53 R72P either as single SNPs or combined.\n",

Therefore, physicians pay more attention to the role of targeted agents in treatment of local advanced gastrointestinal cancer. The clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of Trastuzumab in neoadjuvant treatment of local advanced gastric cancer with HER-2 gene over expression. Many studies reported Cetuximab plus chemotherapy as a conversion treatment improve R0 resection rates and prolonged overall survival of the patients with potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastasis with wild type KRAS gene status. A phase III( clinical trial is assessing the conversion efficacy of Bevacizumab in unresectable disease with KRAS gene mutation. Current evidence showed that neoadjuvant therapy of targeted agents did not prolong survival of patients with resectable liver metastasis. However, this is controversial. In neoadjuvant therapy of local advanced rectal cancer, Cetuximab did not improve the rates of pathological complete response in most of the phase II( trials. Furthermore, there are no phase III( trials to assess the role of Bevacizumab. Compared to chemotherapy alone for metastatic cancer, it is more important to evaluate the interaction and synergistic action of targeted agents, cytotoxic drugs, surgery and radiation, to make a scientific multidisciplinary model in comprehensive treatment of local advanced cancer.\n",

Bile acids have been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis and, therefore, we sought to determine the effects of bile acids on MUC2 expression and regulation in colon cancer cells. Since deoxycholic acid (DCA), a secondary bile acid, has been reported to be a potent mucin secretagogue and tumor promoter, DCA-treated HM3 colon cancer cells were analyzed using promoter-reporter assays of the 5' flanking region of the MUC2 gene. Chemical inhibitors, mutant reporter constructs and EMSA showed that DCA upregulates MUC2 transcription via multiple pathways involving activation of EGFR/PKC/Ras/Raf-1/MEK1/ERK/CREB, PI3/Akt/IkappaB/NF-kappaB and p38/MSK1/CREB while DCA induced MUC2 transcription is inhibited by JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 pathway. These results provide new insight into the complex molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of mucin gene by bile acids in colon cancer cells that may contribute to further elucidation of colorectal carcinogenesis.\n",

Here we analyse systematically more than 70 pairs of primary human colon tumours by applying next-generation sequencing to characterize their exomes, transcriptomes and copy-number alterations. We have identified 36,303 protein-altering somatic changes that include several new recurrent mutations in the Wnt pathway gene TCF7L2, chromatin-remodelling genes such as TET2 and TET3 and receptor tyrosine kinases including ERBB3. Our analysis for significantly mutated cancer genes identified 23 candidates, including the cell cycle checkpoint kinase ATM. Copy-number and RNA-seq data analysis identified amplifications and corresponding overexpression of IGF2 in a subset of colon tumours. Furthermore, using RNA-seq data we identified multiple fusion transcripts including recurrent gene fusions involving R-spondin family members RSPO2 and RSPO3 that together occur in 10% of colon tumours. The RSPO fusions were mutually exclusive with APC mutations, indicating that they probably have a role in the activation of Wnt signalling and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this we show that the RSPO fusion proteins were capable of potentiating Wnt signalling. The R-spondin gene fusions and several other gene mutations identified in this study provide new potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention in colon cancer.\n",

                "text": "Somatic MED12 mutations in uterine leiomyosarcoma and colorectal cancer.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\nMediator complex participates in transcriptional regulation by connecting regulatory DNA sequences to the RNA polymerase II initiation complex. Recently, we discovered through exome sequencing that as many as 70% of uterine leiomyomas harbour specific mutations in exon 2 of mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12). In this work, we examined the role of MED12 exon 2 mutations in other tumour types.\n\n## METHODS\nThe frequency of MED12 exon 2 mutations was analysed in altogether 1158 tumours by direct sequencing. The tumour spectrum included mesenchymal tumours (extrauterine leiomyomas, endometrial polyps, lipomas, uterine leiomyosarcomas, other sarcomas, gastro-intestinal stromal tumours), hormone-dependent tumours (breast and ovarian cancers), haematological malignancies (acute myeloid leukaemias, acute lymphoid leukaemias, myeloproliferative neoplasms), and tumours associated with abnormal Wnt-signalling (colorectal cancers (CRC)).\n\n## RESULTS\nFive somatic alterations were observed: three in uterine leiomyosarcomas (3/41, 7%; Gly44Ser, Ala38_Leu39ins7, Glu35_Leu36delinsVal), and two in CRC (2/392, 0.5%; Gly44Cys, Ala67Val).\n\n## CONCLUSION\nSomatic MED12 exon 2 mutations were observed in uterine leiomyosarcomas, suggesting that a subgroup of these malignant tumours may develop from a leiomyoma precursor. Mutations in CRC samples indicate that MED12 may, albeit rarely, contribute to CRC tumorigenesis.\n",

                "text": "An illustrative case of Muir-Torre syndrome: contribution of immunohistochemical analysis in identifying indicator sebaceous lesions.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\nMuir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by the association of at least 1 cutaneous sebaceous tumor and 1 internal malignancy, often arising in the gastrointestinal tract. It is secondary to germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, mainly MLH-1 and MSH-2.\n\n## OBSERVATIONS\nWe report the case of a 54-year-old man with a 2-year history of skin-colored papules clinically reminiscent of large sebaceous hyperplasias on the nose and back, but histologically diagnosed as sebaceous adenomas and epitheliomas. His family history was positive for colon cancer in the mother and 2 brothers. A colonoscopy done during the hospitalization revealed 2 sessile polyps in the left colon, both showing a low-grade dysplasia on the biopsy specimen. Immunohistochemical staining performed on the cutaneous and colic biopsy specimens revealed a lack of expression of MSH-2 and MSH-6. Genetic testing revealed microsatellite instability in the colon and cutaneous tumors.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nThe immunohistochemical testing for MSH-2, MSH-6, and MLH-1 is useful for rapid identification of an underlying mismatch repair defect and early diagnosis of MTS.\n",
